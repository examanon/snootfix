One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\npost ending 4 marriage\n|\\\/|\n\n\nAnother tiring day at work,I pull up to our little home that Fang and I where able to buy with our hard earned money, with the \"help\" of ridley of course.\nIts not perfect by any means, it definitely has its flaws,exterior paint needs to be redone, fence needs to be rebuilt properly, and the lawn has seen better days for sure but id rather be out here than living in that shit hole that is skinrow.\nI fish the keys out of my pocket and insert them to the door, giving it a gentle push as i make my way trough the noisy door,giving it another gentle push to close it as i hit the light switch, and in that instant\n\nFang,Trish,Stella,Rosa,Reed:\"Surprise!\"\nIn that moment i just stood there looking utterly dumfounded, words escaping my mouth,Confetti raining down on me.\n\nFang:\"Happy birthday Anon!\"\n\nTrish:\"Happy birthday you monkey!\"\n\nRosa:\"Feliz cumplea\u00f1os An-on!\"\n\nReed:\"happy birthday bro~\"\n\nStella:\"A happy birthday to you anon!\"\n\nAnon:\"wh-wha? me?\"\nnice going anon\n\nFang:\"Well,yeah who else idiot\" a small chuckle escaping her\n\nTrish:\"Fang mentioned that you've never celebrated a birthday before,sooo we thought 'why not throw one for him'?\" she said as a small smile brewed on her face\n\nRosa and stella pull fang to the side and whisper to each other, fang giving a nod to both of them as they take a turn into the kitchen.\n\nCuriosity waves over to me, as I'm about to start making my way to the kitchen I am stalled by a mildly toxic puff of smoke,halting me on my tracks as I start coughing, I look over to see the pink velociraptor with his 'science equipment'.\n\nReed:\"whoops my bad amigo, didn't see you there\"\n\nof course you didn't\n\nTrish:\"Reed! we went over this! you cant be doing that here! fangs parents drop by every once in a while you know that!\n\nReed:\"trish its fine, it hardly leaves an odor right anon?\" he remarked,giving me a small wink \n\nAnon:\"Riiiiight\" my words having absolutely next to no confidence as i imagine the potential devastation fangs dad would impose onto me\n\nReed:\"Still bro i cant believe you've never celebrated your birthday before\"\n\nTrish:\"Yeeeah, i thought you sknnies celebrated that like a ritual or something, whats up with that anon?\" curiosity waning in on her eyes\n\nAnon:\"well i never really bothered with that stuff you know? I always thought it was a waste of time, having to deal with setting up everything and inviting people.\"\n\nTrish:\"is that so?\" she questioned, clearly not satisfied with my answer\n\nReed:\"dude,you missed out on the chance to get a whole bunch of freebies\"\n\nAnon\"yeah, maybe youre right.\" i sigh\n\nTrish:\"well what matters is that you're celebrating it now with us, right? No point in getting all gloomy over something that happened in the past!\" she exclaimed, as she gave me a nudge with her elbow\n\nI only shoot her a smile in return\nOur chatter is interrupted by stella calling out to us to come into the kitchen,i know whats coming but i cant help but feel nervous about it, maybe because Ive never experienced something like this before in my life.\nAs i walk in im presented with an enormous cake enough to feed atleast 15 guest with a pterodactyl and a skinnie serving as the candles and a lone chair reserved for you're s truly\n\nRosa:\"quickly anon! sit sit!!\"  practically yelling as she guided me to the chair\n\nThe lights were dimmed until the only visible object in the room was the cake and anon, Everyone gathered around and sang a happy birthday to you.\nDespite it being a bit embarrassing, it felt nice knowing you had people in you're life that care about you enough to do something like this.\nOne happy birthday song later and then came the birthday bite, you give one last look to every one before chomping down on the sugary goodness that awaits you.\nAs you start reaching down you see rosa out of the corner of you're eye and immediately know whats coming, she grabs your head and slams it down on the cake, had you not had the endurance of a brick wall, this would have surely landed you in the hospital\nYou lift you're head,dazed and hurting, to see that nearly half of the cake was destroyed upon impact of your face,guess that's why they got a cake that big in the first place.\nthey take turns congratulating me and handing the birthday gifts, Trish's gift was a nicely made bathroom robe, reeds was a rather decent looking vr headset along with a game,Stella's gift was a collection of anime DVD's that had some very questionable front covers, i glanced at her and she gave me the double thumbs up, cant be that bad can it? Rosa's was arguable the most impressive, a hand made quilt that had little anons and little fangs all over it.\nThe hours passed by like minutes as we all gathered to chat and eat whatever was left of the cake.\nEventually came the time for everyone to head they're own separate ways until it was just me and my beloved fang.\n\nFang:\"So how was it?\"\n\nAnon:\"How was what?\"\n\nFang:\"you're birthday party dummy\" \n\nAnon:\"Oh! it was great!I hadn't had that much fun a while ever since we bought this house.\"\n\nFang:\"you knoow~   i still havent given you your birthday present\" her words carrying an enamorous tone to it\n\nAnon:\"oh?\" i curiously say as i pull fang closer to me\n\nFang giggles, then pushes me away, taking my hand and gently placing it on her stomach, we both lock on to each others eyes knowing full well of what it meant.\n\nAnon:\"Fang......\" the words leave me as ive been struck by a train\n\nFang:\"Happy birthday anon...this is my gift to you, our own little bundle of joy\"\n\nIn that moment i felt nothing but Happiness and attachment to fang,i pulled her in, embracing her, relishing and savoring the moment, wishing time would halt to a complete stop.Tears of joy rolling down each others cheek, we we're finally going to start the loving family we've dreamed about all this time, and what better way to do it with the person who i so very dearly

I still sleep on the same side of the bed, knowing that it would be wrong to do anything else. Shuffling under the covers, I reach over to turn off the lamp, glancing down at the picture sitting there: A picture of myself and Fang, when we first found out we were expecting. I make sure to look at that picture every night before I go to sleep, careful to look nowhere else on that wretched nightstand. Over the past few days, it has become a talisman of sorts, protecting me from what lay within the drawer below.\n\n\u201cI miss you so much, babe.\u201d\n\n\u201cPfft, dweeb, I\u2019m right here.\u201d\n\nI freeze, my hand on the knob of the lamp. Please no, not this, not again.\n\n\u201cNo, Fang, you\u2019re not. You\u2026died, giving birth to Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, that doesn\u2019t sound like something I would do. You okay, Anon?\u201d Squeezing my eyes shut tight, I can feel a brush of feathers across my check, feel her familiar wings wrapping me into another hug. \u201cCome on, babe, just roll over to me. It\u2019ll be okay\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Fang, don\u2019t do this\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t dare open my eyes, afraid of what I might see. I used to indulge these thoughts at first, when they started a few weeks ago. But I know better now.\n\n\u201cDo what, dweeb, hug you? Can\u2019t a wife give her loyal, loving husband a hug after a long day?\u201d The hug gets tighter, and I can feel her body pressing into my back. \u201cHere, let me at least rub your shoulders, get some of that tension out.\u201d Her hands knead into my shoulders, slowly working out the knots and\u2026\n\n\u201cNo! This isn\u2019t real, this isn\u2019t real, this isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d My voice is a whimper now, and I instinctively curl up, laying there like a scared child. \n\n\u201cWhat, what isn\u2019t real, Anon? That your wife isn\u2019t still here?\u201d Her voice lowers, whispering right into my ear. \u201cYou know how we can be together again, Anon, how it can all be real again.\u201d Her weight shifts against my back, and I can feel the feathers on her arm brush my neck as she reaches over me. The sound of a drawer opening causes me to whimper like a wounded animal.\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d My voice is a whisper now, so low that even I couldn\u2019t hear them. \n\n\u201cBecause, Anon, this is how we can be together. All three of us, together\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d My scream echoes down the hall as my eyes snap open. I\u2019m already half out of bed before Lucy\u2019s cries begin, rushing to comfort the light of my life.\n\nBehind me, the nightstand drawer lies open, a silver revolver glittering in the light.","encoded":false,"Title":"Anon - Memories of a Dream","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Amber and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Anon And Fang - Anon's History.txt":{"path":["Anon","Anon And Fang - Anon's History.txt"],"text":"Title: Fang And Anon - Anon's History\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: Semi-NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nAnon and Fang \u2013 Anon\u2019s History\n\nUgh. Finally, another day of school over with. Trudging laboriously up to my shitty apartment, I fumble the keys out of my pocket. How the hell had Fang convinced Spears to let her out of sixth period this semester? She could\u2019ve at least waited for me, her damn boyfriend, before heading off. I know she\u2019s got her own stuff going on, but it would still be nice to see her after school. I push open my apartment door, dumping my backpack on the floor before a voice nearly sends me out of my skin.\n\n\u201cHey Anon, what\u2019s up babe?\u201d It was Fang, a mischievous look in her amber eyes. Her quick peck on my cheek in greeting left me fumbling for words like an idiot, still too stunned at her sudden appearance in my apartment. How long had she been here?\n\n\u201cJust stopped by to grab my guitar. Left it here by mistake, and I\u2019ve got a jam sesh with Trish tonight.\u201d The words tumbled out in a flood, Fang nearly tripping over herself to explain what she was doing. As she hoisted her guitar case up, I could see her face was flushed, her beathing labored. \u201cI\u2019ll catch you later, okay?\u201d \n\n\u201cY-yeah, y-you too.\u201d Nice fucking going Anon. My eyes flicker over to my computer screen, a sinking feeling opening up in my stomach. Shit, did I forget to clean up today?\n\nFang laughs, giving me a quick jab on the shoulder before pulling the door open. \u201cYou gotta work on your mumbling dude. Anyways, laters!\u201d\n\nThe second Fang left, I fly to my computer. How could I have forgotten to delete the browser history this morning?! Ever since Fang started dropping by unexpectedly (thanks Naser, for getting her a copy of my key), I had been diligently making sure to hide my power-level as much as possible: All Saturina wallpapers archived and deleted, all anime torrenting paused, all browser history deleted every day before school. But today\u2026 I had been in such a rush to leave, I had forgotten all of my careful steps to isolate my weeb-side from my girlfriend. It was bad enough she had seen those photoshops I had made last year; no way she would stick around if she thought I jerked it to anime titties and was downloading the entirety of K-On! off of my usually Scandinavian basket weaving forum!\n\nI tried to keep my heartbeat down as I jammed my password into my computer. Fuck, how could I have told Fang that as well?! Here we go, finally. Now, to open my trusty copy of FlintFox, navigate to the browser history, scroll down aaaaand\u2026My hand froze, the blood in my veins turning to ice. Not only had I not deleted my browser history, but Fang had also totally seen it! Entries from last night littered the screen, threads from all my usual boards mapping out a list of Fang\u2019s snooping. Video Games, Anime & Manga, Mecha; They all painted a clear picture of my desperate neetdom, and Fang had seen it all. I slumped back in my chair, unable to tear my eyes off the screen. Cradling my head in my hands a thin wail began to escape my lips. It was over.\n\nWait a minute\u2026. The last thing I had checked out, a tasteful \u201cIs food bad for you?\u201d thread, WASN\u2019T the last thing that was viewed. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to re-focus on the screen, delving deeper into just what Fang had been looking at. It seemed she had done a little digging into how much of a hopeless loser I was, checking out the anime board first, the threads ranging from normie-tier Dino-Ball-Z discussion (Rosa\u2019s influence) to shitty slice-of-life harem shit (Stella\u2019s hand, no doubt). From there, she migrated over to Mecha for a bit, checking out some imported models from Japan that I made sure to save for later viewing. A shitpost thread or two on Video Games kept her interest for a bit, and then\u2026\n\nOh.\n\nOh no.\n\nShe had found the pink boards.\n\nRandom; Politically Incorrect; Cams & Meetups. It was like a who\u2019s-who of desperate internet losers. Nothing on each of those boards seemed to keep her attention for long, thank goodness, but I couldn\u2019t help my mind from spinning out the worse case scenarios for each board. How would Fang tolerate a wrecked thread? A meteor-dodger one? What about the porn? Surely Fang couldn\u2019t have missed those, they were all over the place!\n\nThe more I scrolled up, the worse it got, however. It seemed Fang not only found the porn threads, but found a LOT of them.  Big titty threads, big ass threads, anime porn threads. Reading the evidence of Fang\u2019s discoveries, I couldn\u2019t help but begin to wail again. If she thought this is what I looked at all the time I was on the computer, I was fucking finished. I could almost hear her dad storming into my apartment, his golf-club raised high with murderous intent after Fang blabbed that I spent my time jerking it to shitty nudes. Or maybe it would be Naser, setting out to do more than just shove me against some school lockers. I wanted to bury my face in my hands, close the tab, pull the plug; anything to avoid facing the truth of what happened. But still I continued to scroll, digging myself a deeper grave with each little spin of the wheel.  \n\nThank Raptor Jesus on his cross of rock I forced myself to keep going.\n\nFrom the entry-level pink boards, Fang had turned her search in a decidedly more erotic direction. LGBT became Handsome Men became Sexy Beautiful Women. Page after page and thread after thread of softcore porn rolled on, no one thread keeping Fang\u2019s attention for very long. From there, it was over to Adult GIF. From the look of my browsing history, she must\u2019ve visited every single thread on that board! My rictus of fear slowly gave way to a shit-eating grin as I investigated further. The usual threads \u2013 Blowjob, YLYL, Amateurs \u2013 were on the list, none really catching Fang\u2019s eye, until at last, Fang had found her holy grail: Human-male-on-dino-female. \n\nEvidence of dozens of threads flowed by, hundreds of images providing detailed evidence of Fang\u2019s depraved fetish. From the looks of things, she must\u2019ve opened every single image she could\u2019ve found, and from the timestamps on each they were open for a while. Suddenly, her flushed face and mischievous look made more sense. So that\u2019s what she had been doin! With a wicked grin, I grabbed my phone, pulling open the messenger app, intent on a little revenge.\n\nAnon: saw what u were doing ;)\n\nAnon: tonite u wana see the real thing?\n\nA brief pause, and then Fang\u2019s response sent my phone buzzing.\n\nFang: OMG yes please <;V","encoded":false,"Title":"Fang And Anon - Anon's History","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Anon And Fang - Dude Weren't You Married.txt":{"path":["Anon","Anon And Fang - Dude Weren't You Married.txt"],"text":"Title: Anon And Fang - Dude Weren't You Married?\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nI stand there, keys held limply in my hand, the door still closed in front of me. The longer I stand here, the longer I can pretend everything is okay on the other side of that door, the longer I can keep things together. An errant thought crosses my mind, of getting back in the car and driving away, away from the hell that I\u2019ve created for myself. But I know it will find me, sooner or later. Better to face it now.\n\nThe ley turns, the door opens, the universe passes on, totally uncaring. The slow mechanical nature of life mocks me in my moment of tragedy. I can her here, in this house that we made together. Hear her getting ready to leave. The slam of a door. The sniffle of a nose. The rolling of a suitcase. Closer. Here.\n\nFang stands before me, eyes puffy and red, claws digging into her arm as she wheels a suitcase \u2013 OUR suitcase \u2013 behind her. She doesn\u2019t say anything, standing there in front of me. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s waiting for me to say something first. If she wants me to.\n\n\u201cFang, I\u2026\u201d The words come out choked. My keys fall onto the table by the entrance. A picture of us hangs on the wall, our happiness mocking me.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Anon. Just don\u2019t.\u201d Fang\u2019s voice is quiet, raspy. Evidence she\u2019s been crying, evidence she\u2019s been screaming. I know these things. She was screaming at me. Drawing a shuddering breath, Fang composes herself. \u201cI\u2019m going to my mom\u2019s for a day or two. I\u2019ll take the bus.\u201d She tries to push past me in the entryway. I don\u2019t dare move aside.\n\n\u201cFang, please, let\u2019s just talk about this.\u201d I know how this is going to go. I\u2019ve said it before, and it didn\u2019t work then. Why would I think it would work now? \u201cIf we can just talk about this, maybe-\u201c\n\n\u201cMaybe we can what?\u201d Her voice is next to shouting now, snapping from resentment to anger in a flash. \u201cMaybe we can pretend nothing happened, that you didn\u2019t totally humiliate me today? How could you, Anon?\u201d Back down, a hiss between clenched teeth. It\u2019s dangerous. \u201cYou know how I feel about that, and to find it just there, that you hid it away from me? Do you know how that makes me feel, do you understand what I felt? Jesus fuck Anon, it feels like you love her more than me, and she isn\u2019t even fucking real!\u201d Shouting again. I should be glad the hiss is gone.\n\n\u201cNo, Fang, please, you don\u2019t understand! I don\u2019t feel that way, I promise!\u201d A lie. We both know it for what it is.\n\n\u201cThen what do you feel, Anon? Yesterday, we, we agree to see someone, and now this?! Were you just pretending before, just pretending to want to work at it? God I can\u2019t believe you!\u201d Fresh tears begin to spill from her cheeks. Somewhere, a baby is crying, outside in the hall. The door is still open. But not for long.\n\n\u201cNo, Fang, really I DO want to work on this, please! I love you babe, I promise.\u201d She lets me hug her, my face buried in her hair. She does not hug back. I hang on, wishing, desperately wishing, that I could stop her. \u201cPlease say it back, babe. Please say it.\u201d Pleading now.\n\nA long moment passes before she moved me away, not unkindly. \u201cI love you too, Anon. But I have to go.\u201d Words stilted, face composed, eyes crying. Fang moves past me now, my body too numb to stop her. The suitcase rolls on, out of the apartment. She pauses in the doorway. \u201cI\u2019ll text you later.\u201d I don\u2019t bother to respond. She doesn\u2019t bother to wait for one.\n\nFor the third time that week, and the second time alone, I cry.","encoded":false,"Title":"Anon And Fang - Dude Weren't You Married?","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Anon And Fang And Child - Birthing Pains.txt":{"path":["Anon","Anon And Fang And Child - Birthing Pains.txt"],"text":"Title: Anon And Fang And Child - Birthing Pains\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Amber and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it babe, just a few more pushes, here we go!\u201d \n\n\u201cARUGH, FUCK YOU ANON! YOU DID THIS TO ME YOU SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!\u201d Fang\u2019s claws dig into my palm, the death-grip she has on my hand slowly crushing the bones to dust. I can feel blood begin to run down my arm, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Neither do the assembled nurses or the doctor, or the harsh lights of the hospital. The only thing that matters is Fang and I, and our new baby girl about to be born.\n\n\u201cRemember the breathing hun,\u201d I grimace, imitating the exercises we both learned in lemaze class. \u201cIn, and out; innnnn, and oooout. Just try to relax, Fang.\u201d\n\n\u201cFUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU, YOU SKINNY PIECE OF SHIT! HOW ABOUT I COME OVER THERE AND SHOVE A WATERMELON OUT OF YOUR DICK!\u201d\n\nYep, I think I can hear my bones begin to snap.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s crowning! Just a little more Fang, come on, push!\u201d The doctor gives an encouraging smile, peering over the temporary curtain that has formed from Fang\u2019s legs up in the stirrups. Fang gives another ear-piercing shriek, her hand tightly clenched in mine as she screws up all her energy for one final push.\n\nAt once, the most wonderful sound in the world hits my ears: A tiny wail, one that starts off slow and quiet, but gains in strength as it continues. The cry of a newborn baby; OUR newborn baby. \n\n\u201cThere we go, she\u2019s out! Ten toes and fingers, good, good. Congratulations you two, she looks totally healthy.\u201d Quickly handing our most precious object in the world to a nurse, the doctor snips the umbilical cord with practiced ease. I glance up at Fang, brushing her hair out of her eyes as tears of happiness begin to streak down my cheeks. The strain of childbirth has taken its toll on her: Fang\u2019s hair is a mess, slick with sweat and plastered to her face, and her amber eyes are half-open from exhaustion. But still she smiles, that same soft smile she\u2019s shone me so many times before.\n\n\u201cLet me see her,\u201d Fang sighs, reaching out a hand slick with my blood towards the nurse. \u201cLet me see my sweet baby girl\u2026\u201d Her voice is eerily quiet. I expected Fang to be hoarse from the scream, but this\u2026 No, something else is wrong. Fang\u2019s eyes flutter shut, her outstretched hand slumping to the bed. She looks pale, as if the very spark of life within her is fading fast. Somewhere, the sharp staccato of a hospital alarm begins to blare. \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s ruptured! Quick, get her into surgery!\u201d The doctor parks orders to the nursing team, moving quickly to wheel Fang\u2019s bed out off the room. \n\n\u201cFang? Fang!\u201d The nurse wrapping my hand with gauze restrains me as I fight to get to Fang. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t leave her! I WON\u2019T!\u201d I try to rip my arm free, but the nurse\u2019s grip is an iron bar. Elsewhere in the room, our newborn continues to cry out for her mother, but I pay her no mind. Right now, all my thoughts are focused on my wife.  \n\n\u201cSir, please, you have to stay calm!\u201d Another nurse takes my other arm, pushing me back down into the uncomfortable hospital chair. I catch one last glimpse of Fang through the doorway before she\u2019s wheeled down the hall. She looked so small, so helpless, like a fragile doll that\u2019s been thrown against the wall. Hot tears begin to spill down my cheeks, tears of anger and sadness and everything else that should be absent from this special day.\n\n\u201cFANG!\u201d I manage to free my arm at last, reaching out my own blood-slicked hand towards the only woman I\u2019ve ever loved as she is wheeled away from me, forever. \n\nA life for a life.

Good job, Anon. You are better at this than I expected.\u201d\nYou closed the door to the storage-room, as Tracy took care to inspect every corner of her counter-kitchen. It was a bit of a surprise that the orange-colored dinosaur lady owned a restaurant herself, even if it was little more than a hole in the wall. Her place had a counter with seven bar chairs for seats pressed together. Behind the counter itself was the kitchen itself; the stove, a deep frier, slots for vegetables and meats, and a spot to place dirty dishes on. Further into the place was a table with two seats squeezed into the corner, and on the right side the entry to the toilet as well to the storage room where cleaning utensils were stored and the mentioned dishes washed. Needless to say, your first days were hot, quick, and difficult. It could\u2019ve been worse, according to your boss. The after-school hours were mild compared to the rush hour when customers needed a quick bite before returning to whatever jobs they had. At least you only had to serve regulars with their preferred beers, other beverages, and snacks. But in spite of yourself, you preserved. You learned how to take orders, count money and change, dodge a person smoothly, keep a place spotlessly clean, and do all that in a very cramped space. It was challenging but nice! \n\u201cThank you, Anon! Glad to hear you enjoy working under me\u201d, Tracy suddenly said without warning.\n\u201cHuh?! What?\u201d was your blurted answer as you tried to figure out how she read your mind.\n\u201cYou\u2019re mumbling again. You really should get that looked at.\u201d\nYou one-handedly massaged your face in embarrassment as you walked outside. You were done for today, and since Tracy was more religious than most people, you had tomorrow off as it was a Sunday. No school, no papers to work on, you were pretty much free to do whatever you felt like. With a groan, you placed your hands on neck, taking in the street your workplace resided in. It was not far from the bazaar-esque place where you got your pet-roomba. Before moving to Volcadera, tomorrow would\u2019ve been a perfect set-up for you to slack off, but now it felt\u2026 awful. Boring. No homework to finish, the others had their practice, even the consoles didn\u2019t appeal much to you at the moment.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then why not stick with me tonight? I got some stuff planned.\u201d\nYou barely managed to avoid a startled jump, turning around to face your boss. She grinned at you, cheek in her features.\n\u201cWhat- what stuff?\u201d, you blurted out.\n\u201cI\u2019m meeting some friends tonight. Going to a nice bar, snacks and drinks, you know, the stuff. Want to tag along? Since you already said, you got nothing to do tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWould they be okay if I came along?\u201d, you asked unsure. \u201cI mean, they are your friends, not mine.\u201d\n\u201cNaaah, it will be fine. They will like you; I can guarantee you that already\u201d, she continued with her grin shifting into a smile. Somehow it suited her much more than that grin.\n\u201cWhat about the drinks? I\u2019m not exactly old enough yet.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense! You look barely a day younger than twenty-two. Besides, you are with me! The waiters won\u2019t ask any questions.\u201d\nYou felt like this was utterly irresponsible of her and said such.\n\u201cAw, c\u2019mon! What\u2019s life if you haven\u2019t spent a night or two drunk with friends? I promise you will get home safely. See?\u201d, she laid her left hand on her chest and lifted her index and middle finger in a crude imitation of scout\u2019s honor, mock-seriousness evident. \u201cCook's honor! Whaddya say?\u201d\nFor a moment, you wanted to say no. On the other hand\u2026 you did make friends by stepping out of your comfort-zone. Naser, the band, Rosa, and, to your own surprise, Stella, you would\u2019ve faded into the background if they haven\u2019t forced you into the front.\n\u201cAlright, I guess? Where is this bar?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not far, just a short walk.\u201d\nAnd with that, she started taking off. For a moment you stood behind befuddled before chasing after her.\n--- 15 minutes later ---\nThe bar was nothing fancy from the outside. A mix of various east-asian cultures, it served drinks in a vaguely japan-styled environment. Lesser beings would have thrown conniptions over the cultural appropriation or whatever, but you had to admit you liked it, somehow. Bamboos sprouted in pots, the tables were separated by paper-walls, and each table had a small pit in the center. You wondered what was up with that. But through the power of weeb and anime as well as deductive reasoning, you figured that they kept sake warm in these pits. Which you didn\u2019t really expect, with how the wall behind the center-counter was stocked with little else than western alcoholics. Where was your boss anyway?\nYou looked around the bar, trying to find the orange lizard that paid for your flat. There she was, waving with the same enthusiasm she cooked her servings with. You waved back to signify that you saw her, and slowly made your way over.\n","encoded":false,"Title":"Anon Meets Hot Single Moms","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Tracy, Trish's Mom and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Anon, Sam, Ripley - Hello, Misery Department.txt":{"path":["Anon","Anon, Sam, Ripley - Hello, Misery Department.txt"],"text":"Title: Anon, Sam, Ripley - Hello Misery Department\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Ripley, Samantha and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nThe ringing of the phone sounds muffled to my ears.

God, you two must be so proud, a daughter! I was so happy when Fang was born. What? Yes, yes dear, sorry.\u201d Please, Ripley. Please stop.\n\n\u201cFang\u2019s\u2026\u201d my voice breaks at the mention of her name. I immediately descend into uncontrollable sobbing, trying to wheeze out a response. \n\n\u201cAnon? Anon, sweetie, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Sam\u2019s concern for me only makes me feel worse. \u201cPlease, Anon, what\u2019s the matter?! Are you okay, is something wrong with the baby?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u2026\u201d I manage to take a shuddering breath. A large part of me is disgusted with myself, with the mere fact that I\u2019m speaking of the unspeakable. Oh, how easier it would be, to simply hang up now, to crawl away and die.\n\n\u201cAnon, pull yourself together, boy!\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Fang. There was a\u2026 a complication, in childbirth.

NononononoNONONOOOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d Sam\u2019s shriek is primal, a pure expression of total and utter despair. No one should have to make that noise, let alone hear it.\n\n\u201cFang\u2019s\u2026\u201d Ripley can\u2019t bring himself to say it. I can picture him, the powerful man who had commanded so much respect in his life, reduced to a magnificent ruin with just a phone call from across the ocean. Sam\u2019s wail is quieter now, as if she\u2019s fallen to the ground. I realize I\u2019ve joined her, collapsing on the floor of the room I once shared with Fang, sobbing uncontrollable as the screams of torment continued to spill out of that damn phone.

Recently, I've been acting incredibly self-destructive by allowing myself to read depressing writefaggotry on dinochan. If I was a normal person, I would have just shut down my computer and not spend my time on an Albanian weapons training forum. But of course, being the abnormally autistic individual I am, I do the exact opposite of that. My eyes are totally puffy and dry by this point. After reading a piece that was inspired by the author's own relationship problems with his pterodactyl family, I couldn't help but break down from there. It was so painful, but I couldn't stop reading it. It was like the more I tried to pull away the closer I was dragged to it by a thick rope. Throughout my time at Volcano High, I've really come to appreciate the different forms of art across the board. The three that hit most for me personally were music, drawing, and writing. Now, writing... has hit hard for me as you can see. I was never too much of a literature guy, not until recently, but I learned that it has a special charm that can't be rivaled.\n\nWriting is truly infinite, held back by no boundaries. You can create a world, and change it with the snap of a finger. The reader's mind then creates it's own idea of how your world is. A story is a wonderful, anonymous bond between the reader and the author, one that is mysterious, yet fully cherishable. Whether it is true, fictional, or inspired, it allows for the use of imagination; Our most cherished ability. Writers use their hopes, dreams, fears, experiences, and emotion to build the incredible worlds they have constructed with their hands. Readers use their lack of understanding of the world they're delving in to make their own idea of that world, thus creating a bond that cannot be achieved anywhere else. These worlds truly stick around, capable of bringing many things out of you. They make us laugh, make us smile, make us calm, make us hopeful, make us...\n\nCry.\n\nAnd, as far as I know, nothing else is like this.\n\nI continue to stare at the void of space, the stagnant cold air ever so slowly gliding off of me. With the perspective-changing pieces of literature written by the utmost remarkable stuck in my head, I can no longer move. The true power of writing has left me frozen. I don't think there's anything here that could get me out of this new depression.\n\nI break out of my endless trance as my phone lights up from the desk.\n\n[Fang] hey dweeb parents just left\n[Fang]

Only, you want to run away, pretend you are someone else or just fall asleep forever and never wake up. When you have someone who you\u2019ve come to know, love, and experience all the joys of your youth and young adulthood for years only for it to end in such a horrible manner. With the last words being \u2018I love you with all my heart,\u2019 and how much you have to lie to yourself that everything will be okay, but never will you ever realize what it was you wanted to do again.\n\nAnon felt like that for every waking moment since his grandmother\u2019s passing. He showed his own vulnerable side to Fang for the first time in a long time. He had no one to turn to but her. Now almost thirty years old and living with Fang, all he had left were the memories. He mentioned to Fang about how his family life\u2019s been rather rough, yet there was one good thing about it all and that was his grandmother. While Fang only knew her for a few short years, she was a darling to his Petro wife.\n\n He\u2019d go on about how such a wonderful sweet woman she was, and just how full of joy she was in life. The memories he carried with him were some of the best he had ever had when he was a child. Five years old, up till 4 AM, playing Super Cave Brothers, having to eat through 20 lives to beat that one world with the annoying flying turtle dino thing.\n\nThe fresh cooked meals she would serve during each holiday celebration. Hell it was the best time because not only did he not get to see his dad, but he got to experience grandma\u2019s cooking. Just having her around was his perfect escapism than the creative escapism he was able to maneuver in a digital game. All those boomer rock and long nights of video gaming were all because of those special moments he had as a kid with her. \n\nAnon very rarely wanted to go to her grave. Mostly because he didn\u2019t want to feel that pain. He always had to steel that pain he was dealing with to support others who had also been affected by it. Anon, who wouldn\u2019t give less of a shit about anyone else, always tethered over the edge of a breakdown because he had lost someone he hadn\u2019t come to appreciate the time he had spent with her until these last several months. \n\nHe stared at the sound panel, his fingers traced along the buttons, switches and nodules and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to work. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to enjoy anything. Not the games, not the work, nothing except to bury his face into Fang\u2019s shoulder. Today was like any other day. He just stared at it,  even knowing he was nearly putting his job at risk. Despite his boss giving him so much time off because of grief, there were one days too many.\n\n\u201cHey\u2026 Anon\u2026\u201d a familiar voice came across the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve been staring at that panel for an hour.\u201d\n\nIt was Fang. Or, Lucy, however much it mattered. He looked upon her, his other wonderful thing to ever happen in his life. Oh how he wished he had her confidence right now. He wanted to hear her voice to tell him to do something. Anything.\n\nTell me to man the fuck up like I always when shit got bad. Tell me who I am and what I should be doing. Or just tell me to suck it up even. I don\u2019t know.\n\nFang walked over and threw her arms around him. Already he could feel himself trembling and breaking down. He reached up and wrapped his arms back around her in turn. \n\n\u201cAnon\u2026 I think we need to visit her grave again. I think we should, and you should  get it off your chest what you wanted to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t Fang\u2026\u201d Anon choked through his tears. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore. None of it matters. She won\u2019t hear me anyways.\u201d\n\nFang brushed her snout along his face and it only made him feel even more shitty about himself.\n\n\u201cAnon you won\u2019t be able to help yourself or overcome it if you don\u2019t. I will be there for you if you need it. You know I always got your back. I had your back when she needed you and I got your back now.\u201d\n\nAnon pulled back and looked up at her with those tear stained eyes of his. With a sniffle, he wiped his collared sleeve across his face. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t know if I can say what it is I really want to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t. Just being there would help you just as enough because at least you won\u2019t let your guilt eat up at you.\u201d\n\nThey took a moment, sitting there, embraced in each other\u2019s arms. Eventually, Anon finally stood up, wiped his tears away and was led out by Fang to their car. The drive toward the graveyard was agonizingly long.Feeling as though he is reaching the very end of everything.\n\nAnd there she was. As they pulled up alongside the marble tombstone, the epitaph \u2018beloved grandmother\u2019 was etched on the stone. \n\nAnon and Fang stepped out of the car and walked on over toward the site. When they got there, Anon\u2019s body started to feel heavy, his legs weak, and everything was weighing him down. He got down on his knees, and stared at her tombstone.\n\nHe was not sure how long he had actually sat there but it couldn't have been more than 10 minutes. The wind howled in the distance as the dawn of autumn came to greet the inhabitants of Anon\u2019s old hometown, and the dead in preparation for Hollow\u2019s Eve. Oh if the dead could really come back one night every year there\u2019d be so much he\u2019d want to say to her as he was about to say now.\n\n\u201cOh Fang\u2026 I wished you and her would have spent more time together\u2026\u201d he spoke, shifting where he knelt. Then he addressed his grandmother. \u201cI miss you grandma. I miss you so much. You have no idea how lonely it is without you. I\u2019ve only had you for a few years since and I thought I was actually going to have you forever. But\u2026 things don\u2019t always work out the way we want them to.\u201d\n\nAnon took a deep breath and shuddered. \u201cI wish we had done more together in life.  I wish it was more than just me taking care of you. I wanted us to go to the casinos again. I want to show Fang how much of a master you were at those slots. Those triple diamonds\u2026 they were always your favorite to play, weren't they? You didn\u2019t play any other slot machine beyond that.\u201d\n\nFang knelt down next to Anon and grasped his hand with hers and held him tightly. She nuzzled for him to continue. \u201cIt's okay\u2026 go ahead.\u201d\n\nAnother deep breath, only his voice was lost to the tears. \u201cI always took the moment we\u2019ve had for granted and I hate myself for it. And I hate that we couldn\u2019t have enjoyed your final moments in peace. You were in so much pain grandma that it hurts just thinking about that final moment. Even when you said you \u2018loved me with all your heart\u2019 I knew it to be true\u2026 but I wanted you to live so that you can show it again. And now I\u2019ll never have those moments we\u2019ve had together ever again.\u201d\n\nNo more going to the casinos together, no more going out to eat in those fancy Italian restaurants. No more of grandma\u2019s cooking. No more taking care of her. The hardest part was actually acknowledging that she\u2019s truly gone and nothing was ever going to be the same ever again. He wanted her back. He wanted her back so badly that he would do anything to get her back.\n\nFor more than an hour they sat there at her grave. Anon cried until there were no more tears left to shed. He cried until his eyes burned, bloodshot, and tired. He looked to Fang one more time, who was trying her best to keep herself strong for him. But he didn\u2019t need her to. All he needed was just a hug from her, that was it.\n\n\u201cIt's going to be okay Anon\u2026\u201d he heard her say through her own tears. \u201cRemember, she\u2019s in a better place now. She isn\u2019t suffering anymore. You can\u2019t beat yourself up like this anymore. You know you loved her\u2026 she knew you loved her\u2026 and she loved you. She would not want to see you destroy yourself like this Anon. You\u2019ve got to live for her.\u201d\n\nThey pulled back for a moment. Anon stared at Fang, face swelled with tears and heat from crying. He let out a mournful cry before shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Fang. Y-you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry hun\u2026\u201d she said as she hugged him again, helping him stand up. \u201cWe will get through this together.\u201d \n\nHer hands reached down to grasp for his. His legs stopped shaking but he still felt heavy and weak. Fang guided him back to the car, and settled him in the passenger seat. \u201cI\u2019ll drive us home for today. That's okay with you?\u201d she asked him.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m fine with that,\u201d he replied. Then he turned to face out the window, staring at her grave once more. As the car revved up, Anon blew her a kiss, and bid her goodbye.","encoded":false,"Title":"Saying Goodbye","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and

A soft, fragile little ptero woman with a stubbled head and worn skin, leaning against my chest. It had been years since we reunited, but she maintained her almost haggard look from when we first spoke after several years, only now she had put on some healthy pounds, back to a less emaciated form and filling out her clothes better. She smelled like cigarettes and cheap beer, and it was a smell that now brought out feelings of desire within me. She was so beautiful, bags under her eyes and track marks on her arm, proof of the horrid life she took on after our brutal breakup in highschool. I\u2019m not one to judge, my time in the service had me visiting the clinic more than a few times a month for a myriad of issues, most of which involved burning urination and side effects of alcoholism. To this day I find my liver still kicking me every now and then reminding me of when I would pound a case of beer every night when off duty or chugging a bottle of vanilla extract with the boat\u2019s cooks on my worst days.\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d She sheepishly asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about how glad I am that you saved me\u201d I replied earnestly.\n\n\u201cShut up, cheeseball.\u201d She chuckled while blushing. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who saved me\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess we saved each other\u201d I said as I held her tightly with my free arm.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter what we watched every night, all that mattered was that we were together and holding each other. Any crappy sitcom would do, any pukeworthy romcom, any lame action film. The best part of every night was coming home to our decrepit apartment and meeting each other over a microwave meal, bitching about our shitty day and snuggling together on our second-hand couch. Occasionally I\u2019ll feel the burning stare of my beloved and I\u2019ll look down and ask, \u201cWhat\u2019re you looking at?\u201d \n\n\u201cI just love staring at you\u201d she\u2019d say with no pause. \u201cI love watching you eat, I love watching you sleep, I love watching you make stupid faces while you play videogames\u201d.\n\nI loved hearing her say it. I loved staring at her while she ate too, I loved watching her sleep too, and I loved the beautiful face she made when focusing on her guitar playing.\n\nThe crappy sitcom we were binging came alive in an uncharacteristically uproarious episode, the jokes hitting one after the other. Fang would laugh hard at every other line, and I joined her in mirth. I usually try not to laugh with her, not because I had become a stoic husk, but because I wanted to hear my beautiful girlfriend\u2019s wonderful laugh, see her head pull back and her snoot open up and belt out a fantastic guffaw. Every time she reacted to anything, it was like a gift from Raptor Jesus Himself, and I loved examining it like an art appreciation student.\n\n\u201cHAHAHAHA\u201d Fang threw her head back and screamed in laughter as the sitcom character pushed out a relatable TV friendly line.\n\nI smiled and couldn\u2019t help myself, planting a kiss on her cheek immediately after she calmed down from her burst of laughter.\n\nFang turned a pinkish hue and brought her gorgeous snoot down, looking up at me like a shy puppy.\n\n\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d She cooed in a sweet childish voice.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help myself when I see you laugh\u201d I said. \u201cAll I want to do is hug and kiss you and make you blush\u201d\n\nFang\u2019s smile became coyer, and she cheekily hummed as she brought her wonderful face to mine.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help yourself, huh?\u201d \n\nShe slowly closed her eyes and brought her snoot up to my lips, and I met her beautiful mouth with my own, feeling like my heart was going to burst from sheer excitement. \n\nI woke up the next morning to an obnoxious brightness burning my face, groaning softly and attempting to shift myself into a slightly more comfortable position. I look down at my chest, my sweet little woman breathing softly, still deeply in sleep.\n\nTo this day I continue to hate myself for what I did when we were younger, for what I said and for how I acted. I made us both suffer needlessly and wished every day that I could\u2019ve taken it all back. But when I look at Fang, my heart soars and I only think about making it up to her, every day until the day we die. I carefully rummage through my pocket and hold the tiny box, within it one of the most important pieces of rock that I\u2019ve ever held. I think forward to our upcoming date to the pier, how I\u2019ll wait until she least expects it, how I\u2019ll make myself the most vulnerable I\u2019ve ever been in my life.\n\n\u201cWake up, stinky\u201d I gently sing as I nudge the love of my life with my shoulder.\n\n\u201cMmm\u201d she moans tiredly. \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d\n\n\u201cGet a shower and let\u2019s hit the pier, Tracy\u2019s stand should be open by now\u201d I tell her.\n\n\u201cFiiine\u201d she yawns, \u201cI\u2019m gonna take all the hot water though\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI love cold showers\u201d I say as I puff out my chest valiantly.\n\nFang chuckles and kisses me on my neck. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a tough one ain\u2019t ya?\u201d she mockingly says as she gets up.\n\nI smile at her, feigning confidence as my stomach churns. I watch her strip and admire her lithe form, trying my best to hold back just this once so I can focus on my possible ascent into an emotional firing squad.\n\n\u201cWhat do you wanna do after lunch?\u201d She calls from the bathroom.\n\nI smile to myself, looking down at the ring and hoping that all the forces of the universe will help carry me on this day. \n\n\u201cI think a nice walk would do us some good\u201d I call back.","encoded":false,"Title":"Unbroken Love","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"War Season.txt":{"path":["Anon","War Season.txt"],"text":"Title: War Season\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nWar Season\n\t\nDad seemed disappointed but hardly surprised when I told him I planned to go into the service after school.\nSomething about how he couldn't expect more from someone like me.\nThe only other thing resembling encouragement was a simple, \"Keep yourself alive\".\nFucking goober.\n\nLucy on the other hand... well she understood, that's all I'll mention about that.\n\nI guess the biggest surprise was all the people here who seemed like shitposters.\nMight have fallen into my old ways a bit; doesn't help we get good internet access even in desertfuck nowhere.\nLeast I got \/fit\/ I suppose.

I had made this journey a hundred times over since my transfer to Volcano High, and I was practically on autopilot. As I turn the corner, I nearly run into someone else walking down the sidewalk. \n\u201c\u2018Scuse me,\u201d my mutter before I go to move on. The person I nearly bumped into steps in front of me. They\u2019re wearing a long black trench coat and a hat that went out of fashion nearly a century ago. \n\u201cYou Anon?\u201d His voice is rough, raspy and moderately accented. Raptor Jesus, not this shit. Not today. My hand tightly grips the knife in my pocket. \n\u201cNot interested in whatever you\u2019re selling. Move.\u201d \n\u201cI think you should be.\u201d The right half of his coat shifts to the side and the barrel of a gun pokes out, pointed straight at my chest. A jolt shoots across my spine, and my entire body freezes in place. A pair of footsteps sounds behind me, and something dark is draped over my head and wrapped taut around my neck, blocking my vision and threatening to strangle me. I try to struggle but the bag yanks my head backwards and someone jabs me in the kidney, forcing me to my knees. A car rolls up to the curb. A door opens, I\u2019m practically thrown inside and it closes behind me. \n\nI don\u2019t know how long I rode in that car, but eventually it comes to a stop and the door opens again. I\u2019m dragged out and lead around by the neck for a while, then forced to sit in some sort of chair. A pair of straps come around my wrists and latch me in before the bag is finally removed. The room is large, dark save for a single, dim light from above, and mostly empty, each sound echoing off of the walls multiple times. Front and center of me is an aging, brown Tyrannosaurus wearing a pinstripe suit and staring me down with a cold fury, as well as at least half a dozen other figures standing around us. \n\u201cU-Uncle Moe?\u201d He leans over and one of his tiny arms strikes me across the face.\n\u201cYou\u2019se eva call me dat again, and I swea\u2019 on my life I\u2019ll stick ya like a damn pig.

Moe brings his voice down to just above a whisper. \n\u201cGood. Good. Now, onta business.

Ya know what happens to punks that lie to ol\u2019 Uncle Moe, right?\u201d To accentuate his point, Moe moves behind one of his cohorts and then returns, dropping a pair of buckets right in front of me, smelling of...cement mix? \n\u201cN-No sir, Mister Moe, I\u2019m...not lying.\u201d My voice is almost impossible to keep steady, my panic rising with every second spent in this place.\n\u201cAhh, good, good. We\u2019d have a problem if you we\u2019re. And ya treatin\u2019 my lil\u2019 princess good, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf...of course, mister Moe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYa sure, punk? Cuz if I was to \u2018ere \u2018bout some punk treatin\u2019 my lil\u2019 princess poorly\u2026\u201d He trails off, certain that my imagination would be much worse than any threat he could come up with.\n\u201cY-yes\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, you\u2019se don\u2019t sound so sure to me. I mean, would\u2019ja really be \u2018ere right now if\u2019n ya did nothin\u2019 wrong?\u201d Moe\u2019s voice is gleefully malicious, like he enjoys threatening people with gruesome deaths. \n\u201cIf\u2019n I heard that some punk was out dere pumpin\u2019 and dumpin\u2019 my Lucy, dere\u2019d be Hell to pay, see?\u201d The silhouettes all echoed Moe\u2019s \u2018see\u2019 with their own \u2018yeah, see?\u2019\nI\u2019m being accused of pumping and dumping someone even though I\u2019m a virgin. This is some of the most hellish irony I\u2019ve ever experienced. \n\u201cEspecially if dey were lyin\u2019 \u2018bout it.\u201d\n\u201cM-mister Moe, I...I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d \n\u201cAh, that\u2019s alright kid. I\u2019m pretty good at joggin\u2019 folk\u2019s memories, ya know?\u201d He snaps his fingers, and one of the figures runs off into the room, returning with a wheeled cart. The cart is littered with all sorts of sharp implements, pliers, wrenches, and other tools. He picks up a metal grabber and holds it up to the dim light, his grin growing as he surveys it. It makes a menacing clacking noise as he toys with it. His gaze turns back towards me, filling me with abject terror. \n\u201cHow \u2018bout now, punk? Know what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 \u2018bout now? Or am I gunna have ta get \u2018creative\u2019?\u201d My panic crescendos at all the implications of that last word and I reflexively scream.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mister Moe!\u201d\n\u201cSorry for what, punk?!\u201d Moe screams in reply.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for pumping and dumping Lucy!\u201d I shut my eyes and prepare for the worst. I can only hope my confession soothes Moe\u2019s bloodlust enough to make it quick.\nMoe\u2019s fist bangs on the cart, causing all of the implements to clatter, and then a deep, hearty and mirthful uproar erupts from Moe. His assistants join soon after, all offering their chuckles and guffaws at my upcoming death. Seconds feel like minutes, filled with a terrible cacophony of laughter all directed at me.\n\u201cYa see boys? That\u2019s why ya\u2019s gots ta be careful with dese kinds\u2019a interrogations.\u201d Moe leans over me, undoing the straps around my wrists, still chuckling to himself. \n\u201cYa scare someone good enough, they\u2019ll say anythin\u2019 ya want. Even if it ain\u2019t true.\u201d He yanks me out of the chair and pulls me into the best hug he could manage, pounding his fist into my back.\n\u201cWelcome to da Family, Anon!\u201d\n","encoded":false,"Title":"Welcome To The Family","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Moe and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"SurpriseVisitor"},"Welcomings.txt":{"path":["Anon","Welcomings.txt"],"text":"Title: Welcomings\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Amber, Naser, Ripley, Samantha, Trish, Reed, Naomi\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n   Twenty-one was the number that had managed to register within the frenzied visual processing of the man as the hurried medical entourage entered the facility's delivery room along with the stretcher that carried his urgently expectant spouse and the precious passenger that lay within her. The sprawling medical complex would have confounded him with its enormity in comparison to the modestly-sized coastal city of Volcadera, had there not been several dozen other causes of much more critical alarm that forced themselves to the forefront of his immediate attention. \n\n\tThe halls were a uniform marble white, homogenous and sterile, and the utilitarian fluorescent lights affixed to the ceilings hummed together in a dull and consistent chorus that pacified errant sounds into a grounding equilibrium. Aromas of cleaner and disinfectant mingled to exude their distinct scents, providing testimony to their work in maintaining the pristineness of the glossy floors, not easily sullied by the commotion that had briefly disturbed the hallways' tranquil stasis. Evening summer sunlight leaked through the building's windows, yellow and orange rays streaming forth in an auroral procession that cast the whole hospital in a faint haze of luminous gold. Outside and further still, above the horizon where the crystal clear water of the coast sparkled in the midst of darker clouds, the descending sun had began to give way to looming indigo sky. The vibrant complimentary colors of this vast firmament set themselves around the building's walls as a persistent backdrop which isolated it from the settlements beyond.\n\n\tInside the delivery room on the bed lay the woman, presided over closely by her husband. He, a younger and taller man, matured but still in possession of his youth's last vestiges, dressed in a green jacket thrown over a plain white shirt and weathered denim jeans all fastened in obvious haste, and thoroughly human. She, nearly the same age has him, a long-snouted pterodon woman, coated in pale whitish-blue feathers with a head of brilliant opaline hair, both now fairly tousled from recent stresses. She wore only a white gown which hung loosely over her lithe reptilian form, and from her back hung two feathered silver wings of majestic span. The gleaming amber jewels of her eyes resonated with the setting sun's pervading rays when they were not screwed shut from the mounting pain of her body's immanent labor.\n\n\tSurrounding the pair were several medical staff members, all of them various forms of bipedal ancient reptilian, conformed to the general body plan of their anthropoid counterparts. Their scales and feathers alike were naturally decorated with an array of vibrant colors, a measured contrast with the more restrained shades of their patient. Towards the upper right corner of the room's far wall was emblazoned an ornate painting of the Eternal Son's twin incarnations, the green-scaled upright raptor and the bearded Galilean carpenter, accompanied by their respective crucifixes of stone and wood, a massive golden halo in the background encompassing both heads to emphasize the unity of their Person. The author of life had grown from this Earth two races of rational creatures fit to partake in the spiritual reality, and had paid the price of carrying His cross along two separate Golgothas to ensure their reconciliation to Himself. \n\n\tThe only person of primate descent within the room scanned his eyes anxiously across the walls of the bustling room and along the ceiling's bright white lights, whose stark glow pierced his vision with mild discoloration. Rapid motion and the muttered medical terminology of the staff clouded around the edges of his awareness as competing streams of thought collided against one another within the frantic landscape of his mind. \n\n\tHis cone of vision fell once again upon the pterodon woman to which he was wed, her elongated face darkened by the mounting pain which heralded the initiation of the birthing process, feathered limbs and slender torso now made to look disproportionate in light of her strained and bulging abdomen. The woman's body gave off the appearance of unmistakable strain. The man's heart pounded with growing tension, his limbs jittering against the edges of the metal edges of the bed which his fingers grasped with a desperate tightness.\n\n\tJoy and buzzing excitement had dominated the months leading up to the expected time when his spouse's pregnancy would finally come to term, a flurry of exorbitant purchases and preparations for their approaching new lives as parents about which they fondly speculated with an almost ceaseless elation. That had changed for the man as the appointed time drew nearer. \n\n\tIn recent weeks there arose first as soft murmuring shadows and then as increasingly more insistent intrusive patterns a spectre of dread that loomed silently above the celebratory atmosphere which otherwise monopolized the time spent with the mother of his unborn child. The body of their offspring which developed within the woman's guarded womb had been carefully monitored since a short time after its conception, various medical experts tirelessly checking for any harmful irregularities. So far, they had found none. The siring of hybrid children by human and dinosaur couplings was rare, but hardly unheard of; the doctors had not been fumbling blindly in their evaluations.\n\n\tSuch assurances in regular checkups and months of additional training had, for most of the man's experience of awaiting his first child, done their part in assuaging potential anxieties about any threats posed to the two most important people in his life who for the time being physically bound to one another in the inescapably vicarious nature of the prenatal process - but now they had started to falter under churning black tendrils of worry and doubt. \n\n\tThe latter stages of the woman's parturiency had left him with pressing images of her body's fragility. Her feathers had more often grown slick with sweat, and exhaustion reigned over her for long hours of each day. Numerous varying pains rose to increasing prominence as her body's biological systems were pushed to their highest limits, and the frequency of her discomfort often caused her to become irritable and sensitive. Pregnancy was difficult, and childbirth was dangerous. The sights of his partner's straining form ignited within him unwanted notions of bodily danger befalling her or the tiny child within her, which had recently taken to tormenting him in moments where he allowed his thoughts to wander, as they currently were. Worst-case scenarios of mortal terror instantaneously simulated themselves without invitation in his mind's eye, forcefully dragging him into the contemplation of possibilities too awful to name.\n\n\tSo engrossed was the man in his own spiraling and panicked preoccupations that he failed entirely to hear the first several instances of the soft feminine voice calling his name until their gradually rising volume culminated in a forceful exclamation:\n\n\t\"Hey! Earth to you! Anybody home?\"\n\n\tBriskly, the man was jarringly reinstated back into the present moment. Doctors around the room still strode quickly from place to place, retrieving arrays of medical apparel, solutions of unknown chemicals, and various tools of which he could only reliably name a scant few. His eyes locked with his wife's glittering orange counterparts, and he saw that she was awaiting an acknowledgment. \n\n\t\"Sorry, Fang,\" he responded, as soon as words returned to him, calling his beloved by the embarrassing nickname which she had taken up in their senior year of high school. She preferred to go by her real name, which was Lucy, but they had both long since accepted the sentimental value that frivolous alias held for both of them. \"I'm just getting nervous,\" he confessed, and his voice cracked slightly in spite of himself as he continued, \"I'm just shaking a little. I'm okay.\"\n\n\t\"Listen, I'M the one who's about to give birth here, not you,\" she teased with her familiar abrasive form of levity. Seeing the tension that coursed through him and the stress plainly apparent on his face, her tone softened and she added more earnestly, \"One of us has to stay calm in this, and we both know I'm not-\"\n\n\t\"FUCK!\" \n\n\tThe profane squawk caused the man's ears to ring as Lucy's face contorted into its tightest expression of pain yet seen, eyes screwed shut and lengthy snout hanging open as a much fainter whine of discomfort emitted from it. The surrounding medical staff clearly took this as an urgent call to begin their work, and they drew closer to the sprawled out woman on the bed as she went into labor.\n\n\tThe next sequence of events came to the man in a barrage, loud and bright and rapid and overwhelming to all his senses. Struggling to heed his wife's instruction, he steeled himself against the haywire panic seething in the background noise of his mental environment and recalled with his best efforts the training which he and his spouse had undertaken to prepare for this very moment. He held Lucy's clawed hand tightly, and she grasped his even tighter, first only strong and then escalating into a sharp vice grip that dug into his skin as the contractions began and intensified. \n\n\tBetween the screeching tapestry of obscenity that was involuntarily woven by Lucy in the throes of physical agony, her husband attempted to remind her to breathe as they had rehearsed; an especially difficult task when she was preoccupied with the act of gracing all present with the ear - or bodily equivalent thereof - shattering cries of combinations of profanities which may have been yet unheard until that day. How much time had elapsed from when the delivery began was currently impossible to gauge, for any proper sense of duration was buried beneath the chaotic volume each solitary contraction. \n\n\tOnly in the vaguest sense was the man aware of the blood which his wife's claws had inadvertently drawn as her nerves were bathed in searing fire by the incomparable pains of childbirth, and even then the miniscule realization was quickly dispelled from his direct focus by another shrieking scream of such high and piercing intensity that it bounced around inside of his head, dizzying him by proxy from its sheer amplitude. How he had managed to hear and comprehend the voice of the doctor announcing that the baby was crowning, he had no explanation.\n\n\tThe man was not quite able to hear his own words as he encouraged Lucy to keep pushing, that it was almost there, but he knew that something must have left his mouth because the doctor followed suit, smiling in excitement in spite of his visible physical weariness. Lucy's spouse watched as her exhausted body tightened like a corkscrew, and she flooded the delivery room with a final skull-rattling scream, the loudest din of the entire affair, before she pushed once more with all of her body's remaining strength and strained herself to her absolute limit until the wail of their infant daughter graced all present in the room. The doctor held the crying baby in his arms to the accompaniment of gently elated cooing and laughter. The girl was clearly far more pterodon than simian, and her mother's outward traits were even now apparent as having taken precedence over those of her father. Tiny feathered wings twitched gently as the child's crying continued, her long snout opened widely. \n\n\tAs the doctor cut the umbilical cord, a frail Lucy collapsed limp back onto the medical bed's cushioning, a soft smile on her exhausted snouted face. Hair frayed and drenched in sweat, she looked back to her husband, her grip loosened and then finally broken as her hand returned to her side. Her husband came close to smiling, but it dawned on him that something was wrong. Lucy was pale and drained, barely able to keep her eyes open, her face pallid. Her voice airy and thin - too thin, too quiet - she weakly raised shaking feathered arms and one bloodstained hand while asking to hold her baby girl. Whispers of dread prowled just beyond the boundary of her husband's conscious mind, poised to lunge like an anticipating predatory beast. \n\n\tShe held the child in her arms, her now-ragged orange gems of eyes looking upon the wailing long-snouted infant with all the love in the world even as her weakening arms shook with greater and greater intensity. Her voice coming now only as a fading whisper, she paused for only a moment of consideration before breathing the name she would give to the girl she had just brought forth.\n\n\t\"Amber...\"\n\n\tIt was one of the nurses present in the room that had first noticed Lucy's dangerously weakened grip on the infant and she darted forward to take the wailing child into her own grasp just as its mother's arms finally fell completely limp against the edges of the bed. The pale pterodon woman's head dropped listlessly against the pillow as her eyes finally lost their power to remain open, and before the rapid succession of events could even be processed by her husband the horrible and harsh beeping of a hospital alarm descended upon the delivery room in a cacophony more unwelcome than the most deafening scream. \n\n\n\n\tThe apparent realness of the unreal situation unfolding before him finally managed to reconcile itself within the man's psyche as the medical staff shouted about rupture and scrambled to wheel his wife into surgery, and without semblance of proper cognition he exclaimed in terror the affectionate name he used for his beloved. As his wife's motionless form was taken away from the room a nurse gripped him in order to prevent the advance towards the receding procession to the surgery wing that he had not even been consciously aware his legs were making, and while he was pulled back the fear and horror that had lingered for weeks finally also pounced upon his mind with all its paralyzing might.\n\n\tAll of the worries and anxieties that had for weeks up until now been festering within him now looked to be actualizing themselves in front of him, and he himself was helpless to affect anything as everything splintered apart. That which he feared most out of anything and which he considered above all the unimaginable worst case scenario was playing itself out in front of him beyond the confines of the hypothetical, and he could not will it away. The nurse was attempting to speak to him now, but he could not make out any words; reality right now was nothing but a prison of light and noise from which he desperately wanted to escape.\n\n\tHis chest was heavy and his heart pounded painfully against his chest with uncanny rapidity, his legs unmoving as stone and his arms numb. He could not quite seem to tell if he was breathing at all right now, or if he was currently on the path to hyperventilation. The wailing of his neonate daughter which had been a persistent audial presence since its emergence into the room finally registered within his sphere of comprehension simultaneously with the complete realization of the situation into which life had trapped him:\n\n\tHe was losing Lucy.\n\n\tThe woman he loved, the only woman who he had ever loved, his wife, his life partner, his best friend, who he had spent countless hours and countless nights with, and who he had made love with, and who he had wanted to spend the rest of his life with, who was the light of his life, the one who would be the mother of his child. And the potential was now starkly real that he might never see her again. \n\n\tLucy, who he had met in his senior year of high school when they were both foolish and confused outcasts, when she was lost and directionless and scared and trying harder than anything to pretend she wasn't, when he was lonely and weary and unfamiliar and trying to shut the world out, and they had found each other, and taught each other to grow, and taught each other to love. Lucy, who had carried his battered humiliated self across entire blocks during the most embarrassing day of his life after someone threw an empty can at him and he had clumsily tripped down the school's stairs trying to catch it in mid-air. Lucy, who had stunned him the first time he saw her in her prom dress and stunned him every day afterwards too no matter what she wore. Lucy, who still always wrote her name on every bag of dino-nuggies. Lucy, who loved music with her heart and soul, whose tail was always tapping away to some imagined beat in that wonderful mind of hers, who had taught him how to play guitar, and who would always volunteer to play at church whenever she was needed because a happy audience was more than enough payment. Lucy, whose eyes he would gladly be lost in for an eternity.\n\n\tHe turned, slowly, to the child, his child. Lucy's child. The child who might now have to grow up without ever meeting her mother. Whose family would be forever incomplete and broken. Lucy had wanted so much to be a mother, and this child she had loved with her whole being before it had even exited her womb. And now they were at the precipice of being separated forever. Looking now upon the infant who was attended to by the nurses remaining in the room, the man saw that the strength to bring up this child alone was not something he possessed. Should his wife on this day be taken from him, he did not foresee any possible way of returning to the empty house he and his beloved had bought for their life together with his soul intact. He knew in fact that it would kill him. \n\n\tThe countless moments of his life with his lover sustained the integrity of his whole person, and now all those moments lay before the approaching swing of the axe that lowered itself with destructive intent. Lucy's husband realized now more clearly than at any other previous instance in his life that he loved his wife with all his soul, and all his soul would be carried off with her wherever she went. He would die with her, and he could not change that fact even if he wished to, which he did not. That love he had surrendered himself wholly to until there was no distinction between it and him, and to him this was truly what love was: to surrender one's self completely to another. \n\n\tHis eyes had not left the child. If her mother would here perish, there would be only a shell left to raise her. The family that she would have had would never be available to her as it was, and she would have no other option but to find unsullied joy elsewhere. Without Lucy, he could never be the father to his child that he knew he needed to be. \n\n\tHow little had anything mattered to him here and now than his family, than his Lucy. How unfathomably stupid it had been for him to have ever fretted over material concerns or daily inconveniences or meandering social squabbles when all that he had ever needed was this love. How could there ever be the slightest possibility of a so-called \"bad day\" or be any \"bad luck\" when his family was there? All the world's riches were rags compared with having Lucy and her baby girl in front of him. God how he wanted to live. \n\n\tGod almighty, he thought as his eyes drifted over to the painting on the wall of the Savior, I'll give anything for them. Take everything else away if you must but just let my Lucy live and hold her baby girl in her arms and be the mother I know you made her to be. Jesus Christ please just take me instead if you have to but I just want to live and being with her is the only way I can. Didn't you have a mother? You have to understand. Please. Please Lord.\n\n\tThe child was silent now under the care of the nurses and the male voice of the doctor calling its father's name cut through the dread quiet like a diamond bullet. The father's legs ached from standing and his arms were frozen at his sides like metal rods. His chest to his gut felt like a gaping pit and his breath was uneven. He faced away from the doctor, and there was an acute pause before he began his slow turn towards the medical professional.\n\n\tHere in this moment was the bridge between life and death, and the man did not yet know on which side he stood.\n\n\tTersely, the doctor requested the man to follow him, and they stepped out of the delivery room's doorway just as the child within began again to softly wail. Several steps down the hallway were taken to begin the journey to the surgery wing before the man was once again able to form and enunciate words, and he managed to haltingly choke out the necessary phrase that would communicate his inquiry to the doctor.\n\n\t\"Is she alright?\"\n\n\tThe instant between his question and the doctor's answer was a harrowing chasm, a darkened valley of anticipation, anxiety, dread, suspense, and most painfully of all, hope. This quarter second of time was traversed by the man with all the struggle of climbing a mountain, and when he had reached the other side of the miniscule temporal gap he was in a state of even greater emotional exhaustion.\n\n\t\"Yes. She's stable.\"\n\n\tThere were other words spoken after that; there must have been, at least, since the doctor's mouth was moving and sound was certainly coming out, but those words did not come to the man. As soon as he was able to grasp what had been said to him, and for the briefest possible fragment of time rejoice and praise God, there was only one other word that he had been able to wheeze in his ecstatic shock:\n\n\t\"W-where?!\"\n\n\tWithout listening to the doctor's response, he half-sprinted towards the destination whose exact location he did not currently know, and the older white-coated stegosaurus man struggled to catch up ahead of him to guide him to his wife's room, sputtering a few halfhearted admonitions to slow down and remain calm. Eventually the doctor was able to show the man to the proper room, by which point he had been given quite a bit more exercise than his profession usually entailed, huffing profusely. He gestured wordlessly to the door frame as he caught his breath, and inside the man saw again the love of his life lying in bed, alive. Alive.\n\n\tAn IV drip stuck out from her feathered arm and multiple monitors had been affixed to her chest. She wore a new gown, the one she had delivered in presumably being discarded during surgical complications, and a light blanket had been drawn up to about her waist. She was still pale, but the complexion was no longer deathly in its amount of lost pigment, and the strain that had marred her face before was now gone, replaced with an expression of calm serenity with only the mildest hint of annoyance courtesy of the tall conical translucent device that had been affixed around her long snout with a tube that fed down beneath the bed - what he quickly surmised was an oxygen mask, designed for the unique proportions of a pterodon's facial features. Her lulled eyes immediately widened somewhat when she caught sight of her husband.\n\n\t\"Honey...\" she cooed softly, and he was at her side in an instant. He could not say anything at first, and for a moment settled only on touching her, trying to assure himself that this was real. Slowly she raised one hand to cover his on her shoulder. He stared for a long moment into her shining citrine eyes and the sight was nothing short of beatific. Here lay his priceless feathered angel, and she was alive. Eventually, speech returned to him.\n\n\t\"Lucy,\" he breathed, \"Oh god, Lucy...\", and the air leaving his lungs deflated the tension in his body in one rapid motion, and he fell to his knees beside her. \n\n\t\"Are you okay?\" he whispered. \"Is everything alright?\"\n\n\t\"I just got a bit tired, honey, that's all. I'm okay now,\" she intoned softly, her voice still thin and hoarse but no longer the fading rattle that it had been when she had first fallen ill. Her clawed thumb traced itself gently along the rough skin of his hand.\n\n\t\"She suffered some substantial blood loss, actually,\" interjected the still-winded doctor as he entered closer into the room behind them, \"As well as internal bleeding, quite a bit of rupturing that had to be dealt with... your wife was in serious condition, Mr. Mous. She's a very lucky woman.\"\n\n\t\"Luck's got nothing to do with it,\" murmured Lucy with a faint smirk. She turned her eyes back to her husband, expecting a small smile that matched her own, only to find her husband's face pallid and sullen. \n\n\t\"I thought...\", he began, before the words momentarily caught in his throat, \"I thought I might've lost you, Lucy...\"\n\n\t\"You think you could get rid of me that easily?\" she quipped hoarsely, in the briefest instant before she realized the full sincerity of her husband's words. Then her expression became tender and her eyes grew glassy, gazing with sympathy upon her husband's bloodshot ones. Without any further explanation she understood the extent of what had transpired within him during the past several hours, and she raised the other hand not holding his own up around his shoulder, squeezing the hand she held tightly.\n\n\t\"Oh, baby...\" she whispered, \"Come here... come here, baby...\"\n\n\tHis head fell slowly into her chest, and she brought the hand that had been around his shoulder up to his head, stroking his hair gently as she brought her snout as close as possible to his cheek while encumbered by the oxygen mask. \n\n\t\"It's okay,\" she repeated in hushed tones, \"I'm here... I'm here... It's okay...\"\n\n\tThe emotional dam finally broke and she felt hot tears fall against her bosom as he began to weep heavily against her, squeezing her hand as hard as he could without risking her harm. She continued to hold him against her and they remained in such a position for a long, long time.\n\n\n\n\tWhen her husband had finally been able to let go of her, Lucy was already eager to see her baby girl; her usual energy was returning to her with astonishing rapidity, and color had already made its way back into her complexion. It did not take the medical staff particularly long to learn how quickly Lucy's temper could be aroused when she was denied something she favored, and it was not long at all before they were rushing to bring the woman her child. Her husband had already known the extent of her wrath that could be expended on stolen dino-nuggies alone, and her daughter was infinitely more valuable to her than dino-nuggies. \n\n\tHer oxygen mask had already been done away with against the insistence of the nurses as she received her swaddled baby girl, and she crooned with unfiltered delight at the precious child in her arms: already clearly the spitting image of her mother. Amber squeaked out a happy little noise entirely dissimilar to her previous cries, and Lucy looked upon her daughter's eyes - perfect replicas of her own - with the purest beaming radiance of maternal love. Her husband was brought into the fold of this practical madonna by her slowly outstretched wings, of which one came to pull him closer to her and another rested protectively over her offspring. He would truthfully have had no qualms staying like this for as long as she liked, but eventually he was compelled to suggest the inevitable.\n\n\t\"We need to call your parents,\" he began, \"and tell them about what happened.\"\n\n\tLucy's eyes dilated into what her husband could have sworn were veritable pinpricks as the color in her face that had gradually replenished evacuated from it all over again. \n\n\t\"No,\" she pleaded, \"no way. You can tell them about Amber, but you CANNOT tell them about me. Mom will flip her shit. You've never seen my mom when she's upset.\"\n\n\tA momentary confusion struck the man as he pondered why she had mentioned her mother, and not her father. Surely, he assumed, there was far more of a terrifying reaction to fear from that hulking ex-cop than Lucy's saintly old waif of a mother. Regardless, he persisted.\n\n\t\"Come on, Fang, they're your parents. They care about you,\" he reminded her, trying his hardest to ignore the latent sting of lacking such a luxury almost in its entirety from his own guardians.\n\n\t\"I know!\" she exclaimed, \"that's exactly why we can't tell them!\"\n\n\t\"They're going to find out eventually even if we don't tell them,\" he chided, \"and when they do, it'll just make them more upset that we hid it from them.\"\n\n\t\"...Fine,\" Lucy relented, \"but YOU'RE making the phone call.\"\n\n\tHe could accept those terms. Stepping out of the room and navigating towards a suitably isolated area of the facility, he settled upon a small alcove with a single chair and small table, situated next to a large window which let in the full vista of the crystalline shore and the last reddish-orange rays of the setting sun which illuminated the whole area's interior with a gentle amber glow.\n\n\tThe name Lucy had chosen for their daughter truly couldn't be more fitting.\n\n\tHe waited patiently as the phone rung on the other end of the line, still immeasurably thankful that he had not been forced to make a much different call to his in-laws today. The signature click of a received call sounded and shortly after he was greeted with the voice of his mother-in-law.\n\n\t\"Hello! You've reached the Aarons!\" chirped the sugary sweet voice made slightly tinny by the modulation of the cell phone. Waves audibly crashed in the background, the phone's limited sound capacity rendering their rhythmic tidal comings and goings an indistinct and fuzzy ambience to the call. Mr. and Mrs. Aaron were currently across state lines on a scheduled vacation, but they had been waiting in eager anticipation for news on arrival of their granddaughter. He had managed very briefly to call them earlier on the trip to the hospital to inform them of Lucy's immanent labor, and so they had most certainly been expecting a swift followup.\n\n\tThe older couple contrasted one another like the sun and moon. Mrs. Aaron was a tiny pterodon woman hardly standing over five-feet tall, her feathered form a near exact match to her daughter's pale whitish-blue with light golden hair an a gracefully-aged snouted face. Around the house she practically always wore an apron, and visits to the Aaron residence were more often than not punctuated by the scent of freshly-baked cookies on account of her culinary talents. A kinder-hearted lady of the house Volcadera had perhaps not seen in all its time. Mr. Aaron, on the other hand, towered in height over his wife, a titanic brown-scaled dragon of a man whose rugged form was testament to a robust physical strength which age had done little to temper. His living room was decorated with his hunting trophies and his son-in-law was half certain that he possessed enough firearms to be on some kind of government watchlist. He was curt and dignified, a respected member of his community and an honored former police officer, but God help anyone who would harm a feather on the head of his Lucy.\n\n\tThey were quirky and they were a handful, but they loved their two children more than the world, and could not help but dote upon both even now when they were grown adults. Lucy and her slightly younger brother Naser were the subjects of an unconditional parental love that was an almost entirely alien concept to their daughter's husband. They had been family to him these past several years more than his own had parents had ever been, who had not deigned even to attend their own son's wedding. He found in them a network of genuine support that he had spent the majority of his life to that point unfamiliar with - a particularly impressive accomplishment when one recalled that Mr. Aaron had surreptitiously threatened to murder him with a golf club on their first meeting.\n\n\t\"Hi, Samantha,\" he answered, and she immediately exclaimed his name over the other end of the line in excitement.\n\n\t\"Is that you, dear?\" Her tone grew even more cheerful as she recognized the voice of her son-in-law. She was audibly bubbling with elation. \"Oh, oh! One moment sweetie, let me get Ripley on!\"\n\n\tHe heard fainter in the background Mrs. Aaron calling the name of her husband, and even over the digitized soundscape of the phone he could hear the massive man's heavy footsteps as he approached. The man briefly considered the best way to phrase his explanation of what had transpired over the past few hours, one which would not alarm his spouse's parents.\n\n\t\"Okay, you're on speaker, dear!\" rang Samantha's voice again, and a moment later it was followed up with the rough and deep voice of her husband addressing his son-in-law by name.\n\n\t\"You there, son?\" he inquired joyfully, \"How are my baby girls doing?\"\n\n\t\"They're great. They're both... they're both doing great.\" Involuntarily the man grew choked up in a flurry of emotion for a brief moment before he was able to continue. How blessed was he, to be able to say those words right now. \"The kid's beautiful. She has Lucy's eyes. I can't wait for you to see her.\"\n\n\tA high-pitched squeal of unabated joy sounded from Samantha, and she let out a short peel of ecstatic laughter. \"Ahhh, I'm a grandmother! I can't believe it! We're grandparents, Ripley, my God, can you believe it?!\"\n\n\tThere was a pronounced pause from Ripley, who was evidently taking in the reality that he was a grandfather and required several seconds to square himself with that fact. Then he joined in his wife's infectious laughter, and his cheerful bark sounded in his son-in-law's ear.\n\n\t\"Our little Lucy made us grandparents!\"\n\n\tThe sound of dainty feathery hands clapping together signified Samantha's giddy energy from audio alone, and she closed in on her phone, apparently forgetting momentarily that she had put it on speaker, and the sound of her next slightly-too-loud request reminded the man of the other important matter he had yet to address.\n\n\t\"Can you put our little Lucy on, dear? I want to talk to her, she must be overjoyed! Oh, I can still remember when I held my little baby in my arms...\"\n\n\t\"Well,\" he began slowly, and he breathed in deeply before continuing, \"She's doing fine, but I'm not in the room with her right now. There were, uh, some complications during delivery and we had a bit of an emergency, but-\"\n\n\tHis arm had reflexively jerked the phone away from his ear before he had even fully consciously processed the ear-piercing squawk that emitted from its speakers and which was still entirely audible from over a foot away. Samantha's unbroken stream of furious shrieks echoed into the hospital hallways from the device, earning more than a few curious glances from nearby staff and visitors as the man, in futility, attempted to calm the frenzying woman on the other end with assurances that her daughter was safe. Such high-pitched sound and fury blared from his cell phone's meager speakers that the audio had started to distort from the stress of such consistently thundering volume, and he could only vaguely make out the telltale vocalizations of Mr. Aaron practically cowering from his wife in the background.\n\n\tBefore long there were noises through the device of some indecipherable physical commotion which resounded with a series of loud impacts heard against a host of surfaces, objects being tossed about as if he were listening to a recording of a hurricane. Trying to extrapolate coherent speech from such a cacophony was obviously a herculean task, though the man did manage to make out a few words from the persistently screeching matriarch which included such phrases as \"MY LUCY\", \"RIPLEY\", \"BABY\", and \"AIRPORT\". The frenetic auditory mayhem came to a crescendo before the phone abruptly hung up; whether this was because the option to end the call had been selected or the phone had been promptly smashed into countless fragments was impossible to discern.\n\n\tHe re-entered the doorway of his wife's room with a low and heavy sigh, and she glanced at him quizzically for a moment before opening her mouth to ask the question which she already knew the answer to:\n\n\t\"How did it go?\"\n\n\tHer husband's eyes widened briefly before he took another prolonged breath inward and took another step towards the bed where his wife and child lay.\n\n\t\"It went... well, I think,\" he muttered unconvincingly, the room's ceiling conspicuously the immediate object of his visual attention. \"On an, uh... unrelated note, I think we might be getting a visit from your parents soon.\"\n\n\n\n\tThe next scant few hours afforded them the time to situate Lucy out of the surgery wing and into the maternity ward, her insistence quickly wearing down the hesitation of medical staff as signature vitality returned to her in all its splendor. Wrenching Amber from the snugness of her mother's arms was a far greater ordeal, and the nurses trembled as they carefully lifted the precious infant away for a series of routine checkups, the protective maternal intent radiating off of the woman in almost palpable waves. Perhaps, noted her husband, Lucy took far more after her mother than he had yet realized.\n\n\tGolden tangerine sunlight which had bestowed upon Amber her name finally receded into the dark cobalt of a crisp night. Emerging from the expanse of the heavens was the moon, leading behind it all the distant shining spheres of the seven visible planets and the twinkling host of stars whose distant radiance journeyed light-years across vast spaces of creation to light the night sky with their cosmic brilliance. The night took hold of the hospital, and the quiet dark settled against the building's windows. Ethereal lunar light rested gently along the still and clear sea and resonated with the matching pale blue color of Lucy.\n\n\tThe night had only just begun to assert itself over Volcadera for its allotted time when the automatic doors of the hospital were wrenched open by the pint-sized feathered form of one Mrs. Aaron, two large bags in each hand, wings unfurled, and striding forth across the large lobby with untempered ferocity. To her left was Mr. Aaron, his long-scarred face withered in visible exhaustion, clearly struggling to keep pace with his manically determined spouse. On her right stood Lucy's brother Naser, his penchant for wearing gaudy jackets unchanged from his high school years, and looking rather disoriented, as if he were not quite sure of how exactly he had gotten here.\n\n\tRumblings of Samantha's relentless approach made their presence known far before she had reached the maternity ward proper, and various staff members scrambled to stall her hasty and unregulated entry into restricted areas of the hospital - all to no avail. The halls bustled with agitation as Mrs. Aaron squawked and strutted before sputtering doctors, and the image of trained medical professionals quivering in abject fear before a tiny old pterodon lady was a surreal sight which Lucy's husband would not soon forget.\n\n\tQuite quickly did the meager blockades against Mrs. Aaron's advance cede to her fury, and she rushed to the room where her daughter and granddaughter were being held, with the two men of her house silently in tow. Before Lucy could even process the sight of her collected family members, Samantha was barreling towards her bed, bags dropped to the floor in a flash as a squealing cry of \"LUCYLUCYLUCYLUCYLUCYLUCYLUCY\" flooded from her mouth. Lucy's mother poked and pecked at her as her daughter struggled in vain to be heard over the endless stream of worried babbling that fired off from the frenetic Samantha at a hundred words per second. \n\n\tRipley approached cautiously from behind his wife, eyeing her and his daughter carefully before he made his move to speak between Samantha's chaotic rambling and Lucy's futile protestations.\n\n\t\"Darling, I think you might suffocate our daughter.\"\n\n\tSamantha jerked her head back quickly to look at him, arms fully around her exasperated daughter and eyes narrowed, growling at him with her fangs bared like a rabid chihuahua. Ripley flinched and drew back with his open hands raised in a gesture of mock surrender, turning to Naser - who still seemed to be in the process of collecting his bearings - with a somewhat concerned expression. The medical staff appeared to have entirely evacuated from the room, save for a lone nurse who peered in trembling from the doorway, and Lucy's husband had backed cautiously away from his wife's bed in fear of provoking Samantha's wrath.\n\n\t\"MMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMM!!!\" Lucy groaned in a pitch-perfect replication of her teenage plea to an overbearing mother. \"I'm okay! SERIOUSLY!\"\n\n\tMrs. Aaron finally seemed to let up - if only slightly - as she loosened her hold on her daughter and raised her eyes to meet Lucy's. \n\n\t\"Are you sure?\" she asked, quieter now.\n\n\t\"Yes,\" her daughter replied.\n\n\t\"Are you absolutely sure?\"\n\n\t\"Yes!\"\n\n\t\"Are you completely sure?\"\n\n\t\"YES!\"\n\n\tSamantha sighed and closed her eyes, bringing her snout closer to her daughter's and hugging her a little tighter again.\n\n\t\"I'm sorry, honey,\" she mumbled, her tone now tender and gentle, \"You're just... you're my little pirate princess. You know I can't ever stop worrying about my baby. I love you so much.\"\n\n\tLucy hugged her mother back, her eyes watery despite her previous teasing guise of annoyance and kissing her mom's cheek with her long snout. \"I know. I love you too, mom.\"\n\n\t\"Just promise to bring me along next time you decide to give birth, okay?\" her mother giggled softly.\n\n\tHer daughter returned a soft smile in return, but sighed sadly. \"Well, there won't be a next time, actually. They say I can't have another baby after what happened. This one was all I had.\"\n\n\t\"Oh...\" her mother muttered quietly, \"Lucy... I'm so sorry, honey...\"\n\n\tLucy smiled a bit wider and shook her head, her voice coming to her more firmly. \"Don't be. It was all worth it just for her. She's enough.\"\n\n\tAs if on cue, several doctors entered into the room, the single attendant that had been previously keeping watch over the family awkwardly positioning himself out of the way as one of the staff members hesitantly approached Samantha and beckoned her to move back, the primary doctor in the group holding in his arms the treasure to which the whole night belonged. Gingerly, the newly swaddled baby was placed back in her mother's arms.\n\n\tSamantha let out a gasp of pure delight. The child's father approached closer to his wife's bed, smiling uncontrollably at the sight of his daughter. Naser followed suit, and after him Ripley, who upon laying his eyes on his infant granddaughter for the first time produced a high-pitched noise so drastically unlike anything he had made before that it left all present in a state of momentary shock, gazed in wonder at the child for a long while, motionless.\n\n\t\"My God,\" he finally breathed, \"She's beautiful... look at her, Samantha, she's beautiful...\"\n\n\tMrs. Aaron had already drawn her hands over her snout, tears gushing from her quivering eyes. She sounded off a wordless noise of acknowledgment that was something like a sob or a gasp, contemplating the sight of her granddaughter with reverent awe.\n\n\t\"She looks just like you, Lucy,\" Naser choked out, the first clear sentence he'd managed to interject with since his arrival. \"What's her name?\"\n\n\t\"Amber,\" his sister whispered, her eyes not leaving her progeny.\n\n\t\"It's perfect,\" Ripley said quietly. \"That's perfect.\"\n\n\tThe family had been able to eventually speak more openly without the words catching in their throats, and they conversed in a splendid reverie about the child in Lucy's arms. The girl had woken up after a while without any tears, looking for the first time upon her grandparents and uncle with the clear and undifferentiated awareness that can only truly come from the newborn infant and the saint. Ripley's fawning and bubbly babytalk was a stranger event to experience than any of the previous hours' chaotic setpieces, and when Amber had eventually snapped her little beak down on his finger he had joyfully exclaimed that the child was a fighter like grandpa.\n\n\tSamantha reverted back to her usual self in no time, and after a little while of simply admiring the sight of her granddaughter, she was already itching for a round of photos with her newly expanded family. The predictable round of groans that accompanied her announcement of \"picture time\" was tempered only by the fact that she had been instructed on how to take photographs with a phone instead of an analog camera since her daughter's graduation, sparing all present from the need to brace their eyes for a barrage of flashing abuse. Only once she had accidentally exceeded the memory limit of the smartphone was there any reprieve from her ravenous snapshotting. \n\n\n\n\tExcitement still flooded the room long after the arrival of the Aarons, and none of them could think of getting any sleep even as the early hours of the morning went by and the night's end was finally heralded by the shimmering glow of sunrise. Calls of waterside birds made themselves heard even past the filter of the hospital's insulated clinical hum. After breakfast, Naser had managed to get a hold of Trish and Reed, and later Uncle Moe. With his trademark organizational skills, he'd swiftly established a group videochat, the impressive smoothness of his feat only mitigated by Trish's incoherent ecstatic squealing nearly damaging the speakers of the expensive notebook tablet he carried upon her first glance at her best friend's newborn.\n\n\tReed - completely sober for now, thankfully - had taken to writing a whole list of gifts which he planned to send to the girl once she had grown older. Lucy's husband could not quite tell if he was joking with some of the baffling expensive suggestions he made, or if Reed really did have such an exorbitant amount of money which he apparently had no qualms with spending. Uncle Moe's miniscule arms reached towards the screen with such fervor that it almost did seem that he could scoop the infant girl up right there, and he had been the first to draw a true giggle from the baby out of anyone. Rosa and Stella entered into the call soon as well; Rosa frequently slipping into rapid Spanish as she gushed and cooed over the child, and Stella showing an admirable amount of restraint in not attempting to speculate on the girl's star sign. Somehow even Naomi had found her way into the group - how, Naser did not actually know - and had excitedly passed along congratulations from Spears and Farnsworth, which was greatly appreciated. The condescending, passive-aggressive attitude with which she had usually carried herself when they had known her years ago was almost entire absent, although Naser was still eventually forced to mute her audio when she lapsed into a particularly lengthy diatribe about the benefits of vegan diets for babies. \n\n\tWhen the cusp of the late afternoon at least began its transition into a luminous evening sunset quite like the one in which the husband and his pregnant wife had first entered the hospital the previous day, Lucy showed little trace of having been through yesterday's ordeal, aside from a predictable exhaustion and frazzled hair that contrasted with her usually straight locks. After they had finally said goodbye to their friends and room was filled once again with the solar glow that had been Amber's namesake, Lucy was already anxious to take her daughter home. Color and strength replenished, with only a sleepless fatigue and the scars of surgery remaining as evidence of her medical emergency, the doctors had seen fit to discharge her before dark.\n\n\tNaser brandished a clear plastic glass while behind him one of the attendants removed the IV from his sister's arm, and he poured from a can of the hospital's ginger ale into the cup the cheap carbonated nectar which bubbled and foamed gently as it settled against the transparent interior. He turned to where Lucy lay to see nurses and her husband slowly easing her out of the bed, first unsteady on her feet but then quickly finding her footing, a mild sway the only indication from her posture that she had given birth the evening prior. Samantha held Amber securely in her arms, Ripley keeping vigilant watch over the child while her mother steadied herself. When her husband finally let her go and she remained standing firm, Lucy walked slowly towards her mother, who smiled lovingly and offered the sleeping child to her daughter, who nodded and received the baby girl in her arms like a priceless gem. The child was safe and tight in her mother's firm hold.\n\n\tNaser looked upon his gathered family and once they acknowledged his gaze lifted his glass slightly, pausing for a moment before the words came to him and he smiled gently.\n\n\t\"To Lucy and Amber,\" he began slowly, and then turned his eyes to his sister's husband as he continued, \"And to the man I'm proud to call my brother.\"\n\n\tNaser's brother-in-law blinked in mild shock before returning an earnest smile. Lucy then drew him closer to her with her wing, grinning and nuzzling his cheek with her snout. Samantha happily clasped her small hands together and leaned into her daughter as Ripley laid one of his gargantuan hands on the man's shoulder with another coming to rest on Lucy's. Here was a happiness that no money or gold or land or diamonds could buy and the man had received it even undeserving as he was.\n\n\tLucy and her husband strolled through the sunset-lit white halls, carefully guarded by the rest of the family as they carried their offspring into the outside world for the first time. Samantha was practically inseparable from her two little girls, and beside them Ripley quickly filled out assortments of paperwork with one of the staff members. When they had at least reached the building's exit, the task lay before them of removing Samantha from Lucy and Amber, which was eventually accomplished after a hundred admonitions and a hundred reminders for her daughter to call her if she ever needed anything at all. She kissed Lucy, Amber, and the child's father goodbye, and tears were streaming down her aged face all the while. Ripley had pulled his son-in-law into a hug and sincerely thanked him for keeping his baby girl safe, and there was a tear in his eye too, before he prepared to escort his bawling wife back home. \n\n\n\n\tNaser insisted that he drive Lucy, her husband, and the baby home. They had assured him that it wasn't necessary, but he was adamant, and eventually their mutual exhaustion forced them to relent and they accepted that his appraisal of their current ability to drive was correct. He'd already had a carseat for the child on hand, much to their surprise, and his explanation that \"Mom brought it\" answered fewer questions still. Once they had ensured that the child was fastened safely, Lucy took her seat in the back next to where Amber lay and her husband slumped into the passenger seat. Naser started the ignition and the wave of physical tiredness that until now Lucy and her spouse had fought off began to take its toll on them.\n\n\tThe vehicle had not driven far from the hospital before Lucy nodded off, sleeping as peacefully as the baby beside her. Her husband felt his own eyelids grow heavy multiple times as the luminosity of the orange sunset faded into another clear night, the darkness illuminating Volcadera's various sources of light which glowed together in concert with the hum of the car's engine, evoking from the city's streets a dreamlike dance of colored lights that nearly succeeded in carrying the man off to sleep. Naser glanced briefly at the two of them with a smile, and then to his niece who still slept comfortably in the carseat. The car was finally felt to come to a stop and Lucy's husband glanced up to the sight of his house - their house - standing just as they left it, lights still on as they had scrambled to exit it a day prior. \n\n\tNaser tenderly lifted the infant to himself, and Lucy's husband took his spouse up out of the back seat of the car, careful not to disturb her slumber. She was light in his arms and she felt her soft breath against his chest, eyes serenely closed and her face so blissfully free of the stresses which the last evening had subjected her to. His brother-in-law retrieved his keys from a pocket in his garish coat, Amber still firm in his grasp, and opened the house's ornate wooden door. Naser entered first, with Lucy's husband in tow carrying against his chest the sleeping light of his soul. They walked through the quiet house which awaited patiently the many future memories that would fill its walls, and soon came to the bedroom, its king-sized bed situated next to a crib which Amber's parents had picked out for her months before. \n\n\tLucy's sleeping form was placed gingerly down against the soft mattress, and her husband situated her head carefully on one of the bed's large pillows. With surgical precision, Naser lowered Amber into the crib and let go of her only when he was absolutely certain she was secure. He sighed long and deep as he rose back up, clearly having devoted great care into making sure the baby had been safe under his supervision. Scanning the room, his eyes happened upon an empty photo frame situated on top of a cabinet with imprinted text that read \"I LOVE MOMMY\". He scrutinized the object for several seconds before he was confident enough that its dimensions matched the ones of the picture which his mother had taken the previous night and had sent him to get printed, and which remained tucked away within his back pocket. He retrieved the photograph of his sister smiling for the camera and holding her newborn close, and carefully opened the frame to place it inside. It was a perfect fit. His brother-in-law glanced at him quizzically in an attempt to ascertain what he was doing, but his expression transitioned to one of happy approval when Naser gestured to the newly filled frame, now containing the first picture of Amber to grace the house.\n\n\tNaser's brother-in-law followed him on his way down the hallway and out the door, and he thanked him profusely for his help, which Naser humbly downplayed in his characteristic manner. They had hugged tightly for a long moment there in the doorway before Naser set off, making clear before his departure that he would always be there to help with anything they required. Just has he returned to the bedroom, Amber had awakened, and she began to wail loudly. Lucy had stirred, and a single citrine eye half-opened looked towards the crib where her daughter lay in distress. \n\n\tHer husband collapsed into bed next to his wife, the shrill sound of the infant's crying doing nothing to darken his mood. He stared wordlessly at the woman beside him, enamored with the mere fact of her presence. Eventually her gentle voice rose above the persistent cries of her daughter.\n\n\t\"I need to sing Amber a lullaby.\"\n\n\t\"Fang,\" he started, \"You're exhausted, you can't-\"\n\n\tLucy shot him a fierce and all too familiar scowl that cut his protests off without a word.\n\n\t\"She's my baby girl, I gave birth to her, and I'll sing her a damn lullaby if I want to,\" she snapped. To that declaration he could offer no resistance, and he watched as she raised herself from the bed and crept over to the crib containing their weeping daughter, rocking it ever so gently, spinning the mobile above that hung suspended. Her melodious dulcet tones washed over the room as she serenaded the girl, whose wails slowly faded in volume until they had devolved into soft whines and eventually the melody that Lucy crooned was the room's only sound. Her voice truly was hypnotic, and even her husband soon found his eyes growing heavy from the lullaby. \n\n\tWhen Amber had finally fallen back into the dreaming realm, her mother bent down closer into the crib and whispered, \"God bless, darling.\"\n\n\tWhile her husband had expected her to return to the bed directly after she had finished pacifying their daughter, she instead took a small detour, making way to the far corner of room and stopping when she had reached her guitar which rested there. Bending down slightly and exerting herself for a moment, she lifted the instrument and carried it back to the bed where her husband was waiting, reassuming her position on the mattress next to him.\n\n\tHolding the guitar in the reflexive manner with which she always had while playing, her clawed finger gently strummed its finely-tuned strings a few times to the audience of her curious spouse. Then his curiosity gave way to a profound sentimentality as she began to play the instrument proper, and he recognized the song instantly. Their song. The song they had composed and written together all those years ago which Lucy could still recall by heart. He closed his eyes and allowed her to play uninterrupted, immersing himself in the music, until the melodious vibrations finally ceased and he heard the sound of the guitar being placed down beside the bed. \n\n\tOpening his eyes, he gazed upon the love of his life, whose eyes were a glittering orange ocean in which he was content to forever swim. She was the shining star which lit his whole world, and she was here, with him, alive and safe and happy and close.\n\n\t\"I'm so lucky to have you,\" he said.\n\n\tLucy hummed softly as her eyes grew lidded and her cheeks grew a gentle pink. \"Glad to hear that, because you're stuck with me, dweeb,\" she smirked. \n\n\tAnd she kissed him on the lips deeply with her long snout, before drawing near to him and taking hold of his torso with her feathery arms as her wings encircled him. Her touch alone instantly dissipated any and all visions of the miserable futures which might have befallen him without her. Their home was alight with radiance and life, a canvas ready to receive all the shared joy between their family which was to be. \n\n\tLucy snuggled against her lover and closed her eyes, relaxing into him as she at last allowed herself to rest from the physical and spiritual toll that the past twenty-four hours had taken on her, and her husband soon felt her body relax and her breathing become easy and even. He wrapped his arms protectively around his wife and kissed her forehead gently before following her into the most peaceful sleep either of them had ever had. His beloved and his baby girl would be there when he woke up, and they would be there every day for many, many happy years to come.\n\n\t-------THE END-------","encoded":false,"Title":"Welcomings","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Amber, Naser, Ripley, Samantha, Trish, Reed, Naomi","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"You Raised Her Well.txt":{"path":["Anon","You Raised Her Well.txt"],"text":"Title: You Raised Her Well\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Amber, Naser, Ripley and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n>Given the day's occasion, you couldn't help but look back at the pictures your daughter took on prom night with the young man she's been with ever since.\n>His size and brawn almost reminded you of Spears. He even had that look of calm intelligence duelling explosive fury, albeit still nascent. And Lucy in her mother's dress, the night as a whole, was a bittersweet memory.\n>Grug didn't make you feel like you had to pull pages from Ripley's playbook to keep him in line. Polite, respectful, sharp, and so sweet on your daughter that you could see the love between them from a mile off even then.\n>That's why news of him proposing after they both graduated college didn't shock you in the slightest. Your daughter was ecstatic, and you had to hold back the lone tear of pride that she was doing so well for herself after overcoming that transitionary phase of young adulthood, flourishing just as Fang, sweet Fang, did.\n>That's why you were sitting in the car outside the wedding venue, getting everything out now so you wouldn't ruin your little girl's special day.\n>You had already gone over all those pictures of Fang even before Lucy was just a twinkle in your eye. You would have given Grug your old tuxedo but retailoring it wouldn't taken too much, so now those wine-stained sleeves were coated over in drying tears. \n>Tears of sorrow when you went over the part of the book where Fang dropped off and Lucy picked up. The only pictures you had of the funeral were in your head, and even those were almost too much to bear.\n>But even why you wept changed as you watched all of those birthday photos and life's firsts start to roll in. Her first steps, her first violin, bass, and guitar, the first time she stepped out of your hands and into school. All those pictures with grandma and grandpa. Raptor Jesus bless Ripley and Sam.\n>Highschool, prom, and then the pictures she had mailed you from college. And now that blank page that was going to be filled with wedding photos.\n>You wish she could be here to have seen all of that. To see this.\n>Later on the ceremony starts up and you walk her down the isle, keeping it all together for her when you see her in her mother's old dress, wearing that amulet of amber.\n>You're strong for her when you think it's time to step away, one last time, for her to be wed to her man.\n>And you almost falter when Naser, somehow looking barely aged, taps you on the shoulder and hands forward a guitar. \n>Her guitar\n>Lucy turns to you and gives a smile that tells you this was her idea.\n>\"Dad, before we start, could you play something for us? I know she would want you to.\"\n>You almost break down but smile through the freshly welling tears as you take it and place the strap over your neck.\n>There's no question on what to play.\n>It's her song. It's the one she guided your hands on and wrote out in her head, passing it on to you. It's what you would play whenever Lucy couldn't sleep as a child and needed something to her lull her to sleep, and what you would sit and play when it felt like you couldn't go on any further.\n>You can only shut your eyes and go through it all. The dam breaks and you swear for one last time you can feel her hands guiding your's again.\n>All of it comes tumbling down as you finish the song off, all that's left to do is fling your arms around your daughter a final time, tell her how much you love her, how much her mother would've loved her, and step away after she squeezes you tight and lets go.\n>A few hours later while she and Grug are entertaining guests you can't help but sit off to the side, trying to recompose yourself.\n>You're so wrapped up in thought that you hardly notice when your side of the bench practically raises and a meaty, claw-tipped hand settles on your shoulder.\n>You swear this is the only time Ripley has done this without meaning for it to hurt.\n>He's still a grizzled stone of a pteropatriarch, somehow keeping muscle and an imposing stature on into old age. But there are some warn-out features to match; a milky eye and a few missing teeth. There's a fatigue behind the one he can still see out of that took up lodging when Samantha died and never left.\n>Everything passes for a while before he speaks.\n>\"I wanted to tell you something, before we both go off and probably drink ourselves blind. You did it, son. You're one of the biggest reasons why my granddaughter is getting the happiest day of her life. You succeeded as a man and, more importantly as, a father. You didn't break even when it felt like everything was falling apart, and you did what a father is supposed to do. You kept everything together even in the face of total despair, all for her. You're a man I'm proud to call my son, and you can golf with me anytime.\"\n>You can only inhale deeply and say thank you before you get one of the ptero's rare pats on the back along with a smile as he gets up.\n>He was right.

I\u2019ve come here every day since learning the truth, that Fang was alive, and each day my bank account dwindles down a little more. I haven\u2019t even considered getting a job: Nothing can interrupt what I\u2019m doing on these days. Eventually though, I\u2019ll have to move out of my apartment in Skin Row. I clutch that a little tighter, shaking my head to banish those thoughts. I\u2019ve still got some things to pawn before that day comes.\nThe room is brightly lit, the large windows on this side of the building letting in plenty of morning light, not at all what I would expect from a mental health ward. Fang sits upright in her bed, staring away from me. She seems to like staring out that window: Except for my daily visits, it\u2019s the only contact she has with the outside world.\nWell, the only contact she could have.\nSmiling, I announce my presence as I walk over to her, just as I was told to do. \u201cH-hey, Sugar Lips. It\u2019s me, Anon.\u201d I know better than to get any closer, not needing to look down to see the taped barricade placed around Fang\u2019s bed by the orderlies. Fang gives an involuntary twitch as my voice brings her out of her reverie, turning her head to gaze somewhat in my direction. Her eyes, once the brightest amber, have dulled, her glassy orbs failing to track me as I quickly take my usual seat by her side. My voice snaps her attention back to me though, her arms straining by her sides; I guess the orderlies are using the cuffs again.\n\u201cI\u2019ve brought it again, Fang. See, your guitar!\u201d Quickly, I pop the battered yellow case open, pulled her guitar out to show her my most treasured possession. Fang\u2019s mom sent it over to me, along with our prom photos, shortly after I got out of the hospital. She wanted me to have it, said I should show it to Fang. I think she hoped I would be able to life Fang out of whatever spell she had been under since that day. \nI hoped so too. I\u2019ve played at Fang\u2019s bedside every day since learning she was in the hospital, each time getting just a little bit better. Fang would be so proud of how I\u2019ve improved, probably calling me a dweeb for spending this much time on something.\nBrushing the tears from my eyes, I sit quietly, hands resuming their practiced position over the guitar. It hasn\u2019t been easy, trying to remember perfect that song she played for me in her bedroom, but I think I\u2019ve just about got it now. Often, I would stay up so late trying to remember how that song went, that the only sleep I got would be on the public bus to the penitentiary hospital and back. \nBut all those sleepless nights were about to be worth it.\nTapping my foot in a mimicry of how Fang\u2019s tail use to beat out rhythm, I set to playing our song, hers song. Glancing up from the strings, I can see Fang\u2019s eyes slowly track my fingers as the crawl along the neck. Music seemed to soothe her, seemed to bring some part of her back to me, each time I played. In the beginning, I had tried talking to her, tried to explain where she was, but I knew now to let the music do the talking for me.\nThis morning is going exceptionally well: I haven\u2019t hit a foul note yet, and Fang seems lucid enough that we may get through this without a screaming episode. Smiling at Fang, I drop my gaze back to my fingering once more, giving the guitar my total focus. I can feel the tears start to roll down my cheeks now, squeezing out past my tightly closed eyelids. I\u2019m giving everything to this song now, my entire soul rolling out in the melodic harmonies and rifts that the only girl I\u2019ve ever loved \u2013 the only girl to love me back \u2013 had written, all those days ago.\nEventually, the song is done, the final notes echoing in the empty room, a concert for just the two of us. My eyes finally blink open, my gaze still blurry from the tears. Scrubbing my eyes on my sleeve, I glance up, hoping to see something, anything, in Fang\u2019s gaze.\nWhat I see, is beyond belief.\nFang.\nStaring back at me.\nThe girl I loved, the girl I still love, is looking back at me, staring ram-rod straight into my eyes.

Unlike other nightmares I\u2019ve had, I don\u2019t want this one to end. Dreaming of her, of Fang, alive again after what happened. She didn\u2019t die in the fall, she wasn\u2019t buried next to Naser out in that cold, cold cemetery. She was alive. Desperate, my hands flail out, trying to catch back the dream from the darkness of my room.\n\u201cCome back to me, Fang!\u201d\nMy hands fall upon the cold metal of the gun I bought a few days ago instead.

Fang sat in her bathroom, staring at the tiny object in her hands. The cheap pink plastic threatened to crack under the pressure of her tightening grip. Two. There were two, right there, to be sure. She blinked, rubbing her eyes. Maybe it was an optical illusion. Maybe there was something in her eyes. It was three am, maybe her mind was playing tricks and there was really only one. Fang closed her eyes and took a few breaths. Maybe it was broken? But what were the odds two out of the same box would be busted? Fang reopened her eyes and was confronted with the harsh reality which she promptly rejected, sending the drug store pregnancy test shattering against the wall. She took out another one, followed the instructions, and waited patiently.\n\n\tTwo bars. \n        \n        She started to hyperventilate. Tears welled up, and then ran down her cheeks. She could almost feel the droplets hitting her shaking hands, and could almost see them hitting the shaking screen. It was hard to tell because at the moment, she couldn't feel or see much of anything anymore.\n\n        'Mom and Dad are gonna kill me.'\n---\n\n        \"Fang!\"\n\t\n        The sudden sound startled the ptero who glanced up and met the eyes of Trish.\nThe four of them - Fang, Trish, Reed, and Anon - were sitting down eating lunch at the school cafeteria. Reed had gotten up to get thirds, and Anon was busy as usual checking his phone.\n\n     \"What?\" asked Fang. \n\n     \"What do you mean, 'What'? You keep zoning out! You've barely even eaten! What's with you?\" Trish demanded. \"Are you even in any condition for our band practice?\" \n\n        Fang looked down at her half eaten pizza (which was cold and hard when she bought it), and the salad that she had been stabbing at for the last five minutes (could you blame her? the lettuce was all wilted). \"I'm just thinking about some stuff right now...\" Fang started cautiously. \"It's nothing, I'll be fine. Which song are we doing this time?\" She finished, putting on a smile to placate the Triceratops. Trish, thoroughly placated by the lie, went back to smiling and answered the question - and continued with whatever it was she was talking about before. Fang already zoned her out, not intent on actually listening. She had more important things to worry about. \n\t\n        Do I tell him? She wondered, throwing a sidelong glance at Anon. Her boyfriend. Her mate. The self-correction and implications of that word made her feel jittery inside. It was like a trillion little butterflies were flying around in her stomach and throat, threatening to trigger a gag reflex and make her spit out whatever small amount of the poor school lunch she had managed to actually get down. 'I should really tell him.' But how would she say it? 'Hey dweeb, you're gonna be a father.' No. 'You were right, we should've used a condom! Haha!' Fuck no. 'Hypothetically if you got me pregnant, you would still stay right?' Just stop.\n\t\n        Fang pushed the plate away from her, she lost her appetite. Inching closer to anon, she snuck a glance at his phone. She saw pages of text, some red and some green, and pictures she didn't recognize. Must be that forum he mutters about. 'He smells good today.' She breathes in his scent, his natural human smell mixing with whatever deodorant he used this time. It filled her head, and she lost herself in thought. Maybe this isn't so bad. She could stay like this forever, really. What was she worried about? It's obvious they'd be together forever. Her hand inched towards his, centimeter by centimeter. Almost there. Almost. Almost...\n\n        The alarm rings, back to class.\n---\n        Like everything else that day, class came and went. As did the next, and the next, and then Fang was home. She laid down on her bed, looking at the cheap, pink pregnancy test. She had kept it ever since then, though in the heat of the moment she had almost broke it like the one before. Two little bars, that's all it took to make a difference in her life. Two vertical lines, and her life would never be the same. Her grip tightened. As if she wasn't going through enough already, this had to happen. She was already stressed about the band, stressed about trish, stressed about her family. She really didn't need this too. A horrible thought dawned on her. 'It would be so easy...' She squeezed her eyes shut and briefly considered it, the trip to the clinic. The mental tangent playing out in her mind. Sitting down in the waiting room, maybe reading a magazine laying on the table. Trying not to make eye contact with any of the other expecting teenagers, soon to be expecting nothing but a bill for the service. She pictured the walking with the doctor. How easy it would be, to just... do that instead. Nobody would ever have to know. But she would know. Years later when she and anon were married, and they had a child for real, nobody but her and Raptor Jesus would know that the sweet little bundle of joy had once had a sibling.\n        \n        No. She couldn't do it. She pushed the thought violently out of her mind, ejecting it out of the airlock of thought and consideration. Fuck that. The shame and embarrassment would be bad enough, the doctors seeing her and knowing her and judging her. But even past that, she couldn't live with herself. Even if lately she had had doubts about the little wooden crucified raptor hanging around the house, she had it instilled in her that life was precious. She felt sick even considering it. It was Anon's kid too, he would have the right to know. She'd tell him, she promised herself. Eventually. She looked at the object in her hands once more before putting it back in her desk drawer for safekeeping; hidden amongst sheets of musical notes and songs meant for Wwurm Drama. She stroked her wings absentmindedly, a prelude to the terrible habit she'd been forming. It wasn't healthy to pluck and rip her feathers, but some days it was the only thing that let her feel anything but numbness anymore. It had been that way for months. Until Anon had come along. \n\n        He changed everything. \n\n        He was so cute, so handsome, so considerate. So quiet. Quiet when she talked, quiet during class, quiet when she and Trish and Reed would get into a squabble. He was a silent observer, and she liked that about him. Trish would always start something, poking and prodding and irritating until she got a reaction. Reed would talk nonsense, too high on drugs to care what jumbled mess came out of his mouth. Mom and Dad would talk, and talk, and talk. What's she doing? Why is she like this? Is it someone at school? They loved her so much, why does she treat them like this? Whinging and whining until she mentally tuned them out. But never Anon. She could listen to him speak forever. Anon would sit there and let her vent her frustrations, giving a hug or a nod of his head. If she was lucky, he'd even place his hand on hers. Why couldn't more people be like him? Fang sighed, dropping her hand. She let the handful of bloody feathers fall out of her grasp and onto the pile that had been forming at the side of her bed. She had gotten distracted and hadn't realized how much she had pulled. Geez, it looked like a crime scene in her. Mom and Dad would most definitely freak out if they saw. But then again, what don't they freak out about nowadays?","encoded":false,"Title":"Another Fang","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed and

Naomi, your roommate, promised to let the two of you have your fun alone that night; she had a date herself, after all, and her girlfriend wasn't one to wait up for her.\n\nEventually, you'd get curious, pressuring her to let you see her own place; it wasn't anything special, rather it was quite the opposite. A simple apartment, just barely large enough to fit enough furnishing for one person to live somewhat comfortably.\n\nShe would sob at the notion of moving in with you, tears of joy streaking down her face as she envelops you in the fluffiest hug you'd ever experience, though it would be she who would pop the big question in the end.\n\n'Do you love me, Anon?' She'd ask one night, while you two gazed up at the stars from the rooftop of the apartment building, and you'd realize that yes, you DO love her, more than anything in the world as you pull her closer, and whisper that one, almighty word. 'Yes.'\n\nThe next few days are a blur; things picking up speed not long after the two of you officiated your relationship status with each other.\n\nSoon, though, it comes time to meet her parents. You hadn't really heard much about them from Lucy herself, only that her dad had a tendency to be a bit of a hardass, with her mother being the one who ultimately wore the pants in the relationship. In her own words, 'They'd put you through the wringer for a bit, but they should warm up to you pretty quickly.'\n\nTheir house stands in stark contrast to the dingy apartment Lucy had been living in prior to her moving in with you; it wasn't quite McMansion territory, but it managed to straddle the line between tastefully spacious and extraordinarily gaudy. You remembered asking Lucy why she didn't just ask her parents for help finding a home, to which she sheepishly replied that she 'wanted to prove that she could handle herself well enough'.\n\nDinner went well, surprisingly. Her father, true to Lucy's word, raked you over the coals for a bit; questions about your job, your habits, your friends (ha) bombarded you for the first hour or so, only appearing to be satisfied once you mentioned that Lucy had moved in with you at your request. \n\nThe dinner ended with, among other things, a firm handshake from her father and a decidedly fluffy hug from her mother. That didn't mean that your night was over, of course, with Lucy nuzzling her snoot against your neck as you both climbed into the car, her hand incomspicuously drifting down into your pants as the engine roared to life.\n\nNeither of you got much sleep that night.\n\nThere was a certain phrase your father kept using, one that never really left you. 'Stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea', or something like that. As far as you both could tell, it was just an elaborate way to say 'Damned if you do, damned if you don't.'\n\nHere, though, as you held that small velvet box in the palm of your hand, you really couldn't think of any better way to describe how you felt. It wasn't that you didn't love Lucy, oh no, not at all. Rather, it was the anticipation, the fear of what might come next.\n\nYou both had a dinner date at a fairly fancy restaurant that night, one where you had initially planned on popping that all-important question to the woman who would be the love of your life, and yet as you sat there in your car you could only feel... doubt.\n\nYou knew she loved you. That wasn't even a question. But what weighed most on your mind was that traitorous idea that maybe, just maybe, she saw you as nothing more than a free ride, a way out of her own admittedly-miserable lifestyle for no more than the occasional night of passionate lovemaking.\n\nAnd you hated yourself for it, for even daring to think that such a thing could possibly be true, that there was even the slightest chance that she was using you.\n\nSteeling yourself, you walked into the restaurant; Lucy had already been seated, a look of mock anger in her eye as she playfully admonished you for being late, the waiter coming over shortly afterwards to hand out the drink menus.\n\nTaking a brief moment to reflect, you consider just how far the two of you have come together; you've both come a long, long way since you first met, and that gives you an idea.\n\nAs soon as the check comes, you ask Lucy to come with you, to just take a walk around town.\n\nYou stop in front of the alleyway where the two of you first met; it takes her a moment to recognize what this place is, enough time for you to slip the box out of your jacket pocket, and get down on one knee...\n\nShe said yes.\n\nIt's been a few months since you married Lucy, since you swept her off her feet in the chapel and carried her to the limo waiting outside to take the two of you home.\n\nSince then, she's quit her job at the Shop'n'Save, making a fairly decent living as she taught music theory at the high school you both went through; after all, with a kid on the way it wouldn't do to have her be working a stressful job of any sorts.\n\nYou, meanwhile, became the school counselor; you'd both figured that it'd be the best place for you in town. Of course, being closer to your wonderfully fluffy wife might've had something to do with it.\n\nNaomi, meanwhile, got engaged to her soon-to-be wife; Lucy couldn't hold back her smile when she saw Trish walking down the aisle, the Triceratops practically beaming with joy as she said her vows.\n\nNow you lay here, on the rooftop of Volcano High; your hand draped over the pregnant swell of Lucy's belly as she nuzzled her snoot into your shoulder, the afterglow of the past half-hour just barely having faded as the setting sun sets the sky ablaze. For a brief moment, you feel a withering dread for what the future might hold; all it takes is Lucy squeezing your hand tightly to banish those treacherous thoughts, dread finding itself replaced with nothing more than sheer anticipation.\n\nSometimes, everything turns out okay. And even if it didn't, even if you found yourself stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea...\n\nAs long as you had Lucy, you were ready for anything.","encoded":false,"Title":"Doomer Lucy","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Ending 0.5 - Betrayal.txt":{"path":["Fang","Ending 0.5 - Betrayal.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending 0.5 - Betrayal\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Naomi, Naser and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nLeaving Naomi in the kitchen, I go back out and rejoin Lucy and the others getting ready to head over to Prom. Lucy\u2019s mom has finally managed to get Naser and Lucy together for some pictures; Naser\u2019s white blazer and sunglasses making him look like something out of Swamp City in Stone Theft Auto III, Lucy\u2019s radiant white dress making her eyes shimmer like jewels. She catches me staring and sticks her tongue out at me with a smile, ruining the picture that her mom was just about to take. Fang\u2019s dad is not amused, cracking his knuckles ominously. Gulping hard, I go take Lucy\u2019s hand to escort to the door, Naomi following suit as she wraps herself around Nasar\u2019s arm. With a quick promise to have fun and to be back by midnight, the four of us set off for Volcano High.\nTraffic this time of night is good, and we arrive in the parking lot only a few minutes later. There\u2019s a steady stream of students making their way to the gymnasium, couples holding each other\u2019s hand in nervous anticipation. Naser and Naomi head right off, joining another group of friends as the chat excitedly about the dance. Lucy and I hold back, Lucy nervously fidgeting with the flower and I plucked for her. I move to take her hands in mind, holding them in front of her chest as we stand face-to-face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Lucy, let\u2019s just have fun tonight!\u201d I try my best to assure her nothing will go wrong, that tonight will be totally safe. Lucy gives me a weak smile, moving her head to my chest as she hugs me tightly.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m just worried about seeing Naomi and Reed again. The way things ended with the band, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready just yet\u2026\u201d I can feel the tension in her body as I hold her tight against my chest, kissing the top of her head lightly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sugar Lips,\u201d I mumble into her hair, smiling as she pokes me in the ribs in retaliation for her pet name. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure nothing like that happens.\u201d Shifting slightly to place her hands on my chest, Lucy stares up at me, smiling, her amber eyes trusting every word I say.\n\u201cOkay, Anon.\u201d\nThe dance music assaults our ears the moment I open the door for Lucy. Students are milling about the dance floor, some dancing, others just chatting over their plates of hors d\u2019ordeves. Scanning the crowd quickly, I spot Trish and Reed over in the corner, the little trigger dejectedly picking at her plate as Reed is inhaling\u2026something. Making sure to keep myself between them and Lucy, I steer her over to the food table, where Naomi and Naser are waiting.\n\u201cThere you two are! Oh. My. GOSH! Isn\u2019t this just the greatest prom EVER?!\u201d Naomi\u2019s exultations nearly split my ears, and a likewise wince from Lucy prompts Naser to step in. \n\u201cHey, Babe, didn\u2019t we have that thing to finish up for the prom committee?\u201d Naser wraps his arm around the still-gushing Naomi, steering her off in the direction of the stage. With a final glance over her shoulder at us, Naomi slips her arms around Naser\u2019s once more, the two of them disappearing in to the crowd. \n\u201cUgh, thank god that bitch is gone. I still don\u2019t know what Naser sees in her, ya\u2019know?\u201d Lucy has returned from her scavenging mission, handing me a plate piled high of food, plucking a dino-nuggie from her own and swallowing it in one bite. She fixes me with a smile before setting her plate down on a nearby chair. \u201cCome on Anon, I wanna dance with you!\u201d Before I can protest that I\u2019ve hardly had anything to eat, Lucy drags me out onto the dance floor, finding a small opening for us away from the other students. An upbeat pop number is playing now: Definitely not Lucy\u2019s type of music, but she pistons my arms in time to the beat anyway, popping along to the music. Before long I\u2019m right there with her, displaying the best moves I\u2019ve got. The Sprinkler was a huge hit, forcing Lucy to cover her mouth to keep from laughing, and she even joined in on the Q-Tip during the second song. As the third song, a more heavy pop-rock piece, fades, we\u2019re both sweating underneath the flashing lights of the dance floor, having the time of our lives.\nSmiling, Lucy wraps her arms around me, head leaning on my chest, still humming the words to the last song softly under her breath. No other song has risen to replace the last one, and as Principal Spears mounts the stage, it must be time for the prom royalty announcement.\n\u201cAre we all having a good time?!\u201d For once, Spears\u2019 roar matches the atmosphere of the room as hundreds of students shout their assent back at him. Lucy even gives a sharp whistle as the monolithic man waves his hands for silence once more. \u201cYou\u2019ve partied hard Volcano High, but now it\u2019s time to meeeeeeeeeeet your. Prom. ROYALTY!\u201d Cheers erupt from the crowd, overriding the boos from Lucy as she protests this outdated and sexist tradition. I stay quiet, my eyes locked onto the stage.\n\u201cNow, without further delay, your winners are\u2026\u201d Spears reaches into his breast pocket, ripping open the garish envelope displaying the school colors. Unfolding the small paper within, the Principal adjusts his glasses for dramatic effect, before bellowing: \u201cNAOMI AND NAAAAAAAASER!\u201d\nCheers erupt once more from the assembled student body, barely covering an excited shriek from Naomi. As the couple mounts the stage, I clap along with the other students, eliciting a questioning look from Lucy as she\u2019s shifted suddenly from my chest.\n\u201cAnon, what the hell are you doing?!\u201d Lucy asks, crossing her arms and glaring up at me. I say nothing in response, simply nodding my head up to the stage where Naomi is quickly adjusting the microphone stand.\n\u201cIs this thing on? Okay. THANK YOU VOLCANO HIGH!\u201d More cheers erupt from the crowd, and I add my own to the mix this time. Lucy\u2019s eyes are flickering back and forth between the couple on stage and me, confusion spreading across her face. \u201cNaser and I are SOOOOO happy to be your Prom Royalty this year! We would like to thank alllllllll the organizers who made this event possible!\u201d \nAnother pause for cheers. I\u2019m staring at Naomi now, a broad smile on my face. Glancing out of the corner of my eye, I can see Lucy staring fully at me now, utterly bewildered. Her mouth works silently for words as Naomi\u2019s thanks prattle on.\n\u201cFinally, I\u2019ve got one special thank you to give out. Where\u2019s Anon? Anon? Oh! There, there you are! Wave to everyone Anon!\u201d A spotlight is turned on me as I wave eagerly to the assembled crowd. Distant shouts of \u201cweeb!\u201d and \u201closer!\u201d can be heard from the crowd, but I pay them little attention as I slowly turn to face Lucy. My date\u2019s eyes plead me for some explanation as she takes a half-step back from me, the hard light of the spotlight reflecting off her perfect white dress.\n\u201cWithout Anon, none of this would\u2019ve been possible. Without Anon, Naser\u2019s bitch of a sister would\u2019ve still been in our way, messing things up like always. Is that \u201cFang\u201d standing next to you, Anon? Good, she needs to hear this too.\u201d Naomi\u2019s air-quotes around Lucy\u2019s other name seem to bite into her, causing her to flinch at the sound. She still hasn\u2019t taken her eyes off of me.\n\u201cDid you really think Anon liked you, \u201cFang\u201d? Maybe even loved you? Ha! No one could love a loser like you, \u201cFang\u201d! I needed someone to get you out of Naser\u2019s hair, and Anon volunteered for us just after your little concert on his first day!\u201d Up on stage, Naser\u2019s face is split in an evil grin, matching my own as she too stares at his sister. All eyes are on the two of us now, the crowd going silent as our plan is read out-loud. Tears are brimming in Lucy\u2019s eyes now, and quiet whispers of \u201cno\u201d can be heard underneath Naomi\u2019s taunts and jeers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right \u201cFang\u201d! You\u2019re such a loser, we needed the new kid to pretend to be your friend! Isn\u2019t that hilarious, everyone? She\u2019s such a loser, no one in the school who knew you could even pretend to like you! Hahahaha!\u201d \nNaomi\u2019s shrill laughter is quickly joined by others from the assembled students, and before long the air is filled with the jeers and cackles of the assembled students, all directed at Lucy. I alone remain quiet among the students on the dance floor, my grin never faltering as I watch Lucy\u2019s face become more and more distraught, the river of tears spilling across her face leaving back rivulets of mascara as she continues to stare at me. She\u2019s no longer whispering under her breath, but her hands have found their way to her wings, a cascade of bloody feathers falling around her as she begins to preen. Lucy moves to take a half-step back towards me by instinct, desperately seeking the one source of comfort she had found in these last few weeks.\nI take a step back from her. \nLucy stopped suddenly, her eyes no longer seeing me, seeing anything. Her hands worked methodically, pulling fistfuls of feathers out as she sank to her knees, still staring off into space as the crowd\u2019s laughter echoed through the gymnasium. Unable to hold it in any longer, I join the rest of the students, pointing at Lucy and laughing until I can barely stand up straight. All the while Lucy just sat there, staring at nothing, tears flowing from her eyes even as her now-bloody hands tore into her wings. \nMy last words to her were \u201cwho could ever love someone like you?\u201d","encoded":false,"Title":"Ending 0.5 - Betrayal","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Naomi, Naser and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Ending 1 -

The two of us have been inseparable nearly this whole time I\u2019ve been back, it feels like a dream. Seeing Lucy again\u2026 Something inside of me just feels\u2026 complete. It\u2019s all I can do to let her go in the mornings, to look after the gaggle of kids at the church\u2019s day-care. Though, Lucy seems at-ease around the kids, more than she is when we\u2019re out on our nearly nightly dates. She tries to be strong, but I can see the pain and fear in her eyes when she walks near the places we used to go to as teenagers. Lucy nearly broke down in tears when we passed her old favorite guitar shop yesterday. While I\u2019ve tried to get her to take up music again, it\u2019s still too much, too fast. I know I\u2019ve got to take this slow, and savor every moment.\nToday, we\u2019re having dinner with her parents. Her family has been a big help, getting me set up with an apartment in a much nicer part of town than I lived in before. Ripley even offered to take me golfing, although I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to take him up on that offer just yet. For now though, any chance I can get to spend with Lucy is fine by me. \nStanding outside the day-care room, I wait for Lucy to get ready, browsing the pictures on the wall, each a poorly drawn symphony in crayon. The kids are out right now: Lucy said something about them getting their last psalm lesson for the day before their parents pick them up. A lot of the other staff at the church have been helping out, giving Lucy and I more time to get re-acquainted. Secretly, I think they just want us to get married as quickly as we can. I can see the half-hidden smiles when I talk to Lucy\u2019s church group, feel their eyes on our backs as I walk her home. Clearly, these people think Petro Estrus season is in full-swing, and I must be taking advantage of it!\n\u2026Not that they aren\u2019t wrong, though\u2026\n\u2026\nShould I be thinking about that in a church? \nA small cough and a tug on my pants legs snaps be back to reality. Turning away from the crayon scribbles, my face blushing, I have to re-adjust my gaze slightly before I can take in the interruption: A dozen or so dino-kids, none older than 6, stand around my ankles, each pair of eyes as big as saucers as they stare up at me. \nApparently all that training in special-forces doesn\u2019t amount to crap when faced with a horde of dino-tykes.\nOne such tyke, a bespectacled steggo boy of maybe four, gives my pants leg another tug, his small backpack gently clasped in his other hand.\n\u201cAre you Mister Anon?\u201d\nHis question immediately opens the flood gates, as the others pile on their voices.\n\u201cHe\u2019s scary!\u201d\n\u201cMissus Wucy said we can\u2019t talk to stwangers!\u201d\n\u201cAre all humans like him?\u201d\nSmiling, I move to crouch low on my heels, sending the kids shuffling back with barely-contained gasps. The little steggo boy holds his ground however, his glasses amplifying his wonderous gaze as he now stares at me face-to-face.\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s me,\u201d I say, holding out my hand. Somehow, the little boy\u2019s eyes go even wider as he reaches out his hand, mine own dwarfing it several times over as I give it a little shake. \u201cYou must be Ms. Lucy\u2019s class?\u201d\nThat seemed to have loosened them up a little. Kids aren\u2019t afraid of anything for long, and now that I was officially \u201cnot a stranger\u201d in their minds, they began crowding around me once more, small scaly hands measured against mine, little budding horns fingers as they gazed wondrously up at my chrome dome.\n\u201cWow!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sooooo cool!\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have any horns, Mister Anon?\n\u201cWhy are you scwales all soft and pink?\nLaughing, I let them clamber around me, pulling at my clothes as I struggle to answer their questions. \u201cNo, humans don\u2019t have horns, we have hair. No, no scales either. Yes, I am fully grown. No, not everyone has hair. No, I don\u2019t loose my hair-horns every season. Okay, maybe cool it with the hair questions, okay?\u201d\nUndeterred, the kids continue their verbal onslaught, poking and prodding me like I\u2019m the most interesting thing to crawl out from under a rock they\u2019ve seen all day. Just as I\u2019m starting to wonder what\u2019s keeping Lucy, a little girl at the back of the pack speaks up, her squeaky voice silent up until now.\n\u201cDo you wuv Missus Wucy?\u201d\nThe dino-tykes stop their badgering, settling down expectantly. I can feel my muscles clench slightly, a shiver of\u2026 something, running down my spine.\nSensing my weakness, the little girl chimes up again. \u201cMissus Wucy said she wuved someone, wonce. She, umm, said she felt com-fort-uh-bull wonce before, and now she says she feels, uh, the same way now.\u201d\nI never thought the one who would take me down like this would be wearing a pink frilly tutu and matching Dino-Pals sweatshirt. \nI\u2019m silent for a while, as I consider the little tyke\u2019s question. Finally, I smile once more, hoping to through this little assassin off her attack.\n\u201cMs. Lucy has had a some really tough times before, you know? I only knew her a short while, when we were big-kids, and I hoped I could help her through those rough times. See, she meant a lot to me back then, and she means maybe even more now. Love is a really\u2026 nice thing to have, for grown-ups, and I hope I can give her thiiiiiiiis much!\u201d Spreading my arms out wide, I attempt to indicate just how much love I hoped to give Lucy.\nThere wasn\u2019t enough room in the world to display that amount, however.\nImmediately, the dino-tykes are on me once more, each squeaky voice crying out their acceptance for me, letting me know how nice \u201cMissus Wucy\u201d was, and how much they were glad she could have someone again. I caught some of them reaching their arms out wide, mimicking my display, showing me just how much they loved Lucy too. \n\u201cWow, that\u2019s a wot!\u201d\n\u201cI wanna be like Anon when I grow up!\u201d\n\u201cMissus Lucy is cute! CUTE!\u201d\nGlancing up, I caught sight of Lucy through the open day-care door, having finally gathered up her things from the church office on the other side of the building. Quickly, I shushed the dino-tykes as best I could, holding up a finger to my lips until they all copied me.\n\u201cBut this is our secret, okay? We can\u2019t let Ms. Lucy find out, it\u2019s a surprise!\u201d The dino-tykes were eager to agree, shushing each other in turn as I sprang quickly to my feet. Lucy cocked an eyebrow questioningly as she entered the day-care, meeting me half-way as I moved towards her.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a surprise, Anon?\u201d Lucy asked as I took her hand in mine. Giving it a little squeeze, I just smiled, pressing my finger to my lips once more. The still-assembled dino-tykes did the same, nearly shushing Lucy in unison. Laughing, Lucy shook her head, smiling at her assembled class.\n\u201cOkay, well then it can be a secret! Kids, your mommies and daddies are here to come get you, so why you don\u2019t run over to Ms. Sarah so she can release you, okay?\u201d A cacophony of cheers greets Lucy\u2019s discharge, the little kids scampering around us to re-join their families. The little girl from before hesitates in front of us for a moment, looking up at us and nodding astutely before giving my leg a big hug and running off to join the rest of the class. Lucy\u2019s amber eyes catch mine, a look of utter bewilderment on her face.\n\u201cWhat was that all about, Anon?\u201d As we step out of the day-care, Lucy wraps her arm around mine as we head out to dinner. I can\u2019t help but smile as I glance down at her, drinking in the beauty of her face as we pass through the halls of the church.\n\u201cOh, you know how kids are, right? Sometimes, they\u2019re just who you need to talk to.\u201d I hold open the door, Lucy pausing for a second before turning to leave.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still such a dweeb, Anon.\u201d","encoded":false,"Title":"Ending 3 - Anon and The Dino-Tykes","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Ending 3 - Light Inside.txt":{"path":["Fang","Ending 3 - Light Inside.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending 3 - Light Inside\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Trish, Stella and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Cobalt_Blue_Sphere\nSummary: She knew she was supposed to do better. She knew she was supposed to fix herself, but nothing worked out.\nShe knew with the certainty of truth that she was a weak person. For three years she lived, inflicting herself on no-one, and waited for the light to come back and shine on her again. But a light shining on the outside fixes nothing. Far from it; it only illuminates problems.\n\n\nI placed the heavy box down on the wood floor and wiped my brow. Moving was always a massive hassle, even back when I didn\u2019t have much stuff to cart around, but now that we were bringing Lucy\u2019s things as well, it was a downright nightmare. We hadn\u2019t quite needed a truck, but we\u2019d managed to pack a moving van full to the brim.\n\nStill, once it was over, it would all be out of the way. Better to just sack up and push through it.\n\nWe\u2019d found a decent sized little apartment together, not in Skin Row this time. Lucy had been set on moving out of her parents\u2019 place and living with me, and I was more than happy with that idea \u2013 but only after clearing it with her dad. Ripley\u2019s bad side was not something I ever wanted to be on. The big bad ptero patriarch had come around pretty quickly, thank God. I remember there\u2019d been a time when Lucy\u2019s mother would have to play mediator in any conversation between me and him, but nowadays he seemed almost glad that I was there.\n\nMind you, he\u2019d still clapped me on the shoulder and quietly but firmly reminded me to treat his daughter well... and then invited me to go golfing with him sometime. I just remembered what he said about that 9-iron and tried not to shudder. Even with the shit I\u2019d seen in the desert, he was something else.\n\nJust as I turned around to start heading back out to the van, Lucy came through the open doorway, several smaller boxes teetering in her arms. \u201cThese are the last few, Anon. Can you grab some off me?\u201d\n\nI pulled a few from the top of the tower and set them down, leaving her to kick the door shut before planting her boxes down next to mine.\n\n\u201cWhew! That\u2019s the lot of it!\u201d She clapped her hands together as we both stood up straight.\n\n\u201cYep, now we just need to actually unpack it,\u201d I remarked. Her face fell comically.\n\nOn the one hand, I was kind of thankful she hadn\u2019t wanted to bring her old piano along with us when I\u2019d asked. On the other though, I hadn\u2019t missed the wince on her face before she\u2019d started making excuses. \u2018Too much effort getting it up out of the basement\u2019, \u2018It was my grandma\u2019s, it should stay with mom and dad\u2019, \u2018It probably won\u2019t fit in the apartment\u2019.\n\nAll rang true enough as she gave them, I supposed. Wasn\u2019t hard to tell that she had another reason for saying them, though. And that she didn\u2019t want to even bring her guitar spoke volumes more.\n\nIt had been a few months since I\u2019d returned to Volcaldera, and I\u2019d spent as much of it with Lucy as I could, but I hadn\u2019t forgotten what she\u2019d said to me that first night. And since that day, I\u2019d... noticed a few things. The way her gaze lingered dolefully on the church organ every other time we attended Sunday mass, or how she\u2019d sported an outright woeful look at some kid\u2019s guitar case they\u2019d left in the foyer. The way she completely avoided talking about anything or anyone from Volcano High. The way she\u2019d pulled me down alternate routes to avoid going past the school every time she\u2019d walked home with me from the park. It was pretty obvious there was something amiss.  There was something... almost haunting her, I supposed. It had me worried.\n\nBut at the same time, I couldn\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t doing well in her own right. I was really impressed with how well she\u2019d been holding up since I\u2018d been deployed. Life might have taken a left turn, but she\u2019d still been moving forward \u2013 she had an associate\u2019s degree and steady employment teaching preschool.\n\nShe was tougher than she gave herself credit for.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Every other night I\u2019d racked my brains, trying to think of a way to help her be happy with everything she\u2019d done, but no easy answer ever came to me. I didn\u2019t have the heart to push her into anything she might not be ready for. I couldn\u2019t do that to her.\n\nWe\u2019d been apart for three years, and in that time, she\u2019d had no-one. She\u2019d lived in almost self-imposed exile that whole time. It didn\u2019t feel fair to even want to push her into anything, just a few short months after I\u2019d returned. It didn\u2019t feel right.\n\nI looked over to see her just standing there blankly looking at our belongings, seemingly having run out of energy.\n\n\u201cYou doing alright, Lucy?\u201d I broke the silence that had fallen. Almost immediately she snapped back to attention.\n\n\u201cYeah! Sorry, was just thinking. I know this\u2019ll sound stupid, but now that you\u2019re back... I really feel like I can mean something again.\u201d She beamed at me, then cast her hands out over the assorted boxes and bags. \u201cLike this is all a new start on life, you know? We\u2019ve actually got our own place! You know how long I\u2019ve been looking forward to this?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does kind of feel like that,\u201d I agreed as I returned her smile. \u201cWhich box did we put the plates in, do you remember? We should get something to eat before we start unpacking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t actually pack anything to eat in those boxes, Anon, plates aren\u2019t going to help us,\u201d She rolled her eyes. She seemed completely animated again. \u201cYou\u2019re right, though. Come on, let\u2019s just go out and grab something.\u201d\n\nI followed her out the door, leaving my worries with the boxes for now. I could think about it later.\n\n\n\nThat night was quiet as we settled into bed. We were both tired from the move, and there was still more for us to do tomorrow \u2013 neither of us were up for anything more. I laid in bed with Lucy tucked up tightly against my side, but despite the day\u2019s exertion sleep wasn\u2019t coming as easily to me as it had to her.\n\nHer wings were flopped down underneath the blanket, flat against the mattress. I never saw her looking like this when she was awake. She was always either abuzz with energy, busily making her way through the day, or completely spent, an absent look on her face as she did nothing at all just like yesterday. While she was asleep, though, she looked completely content, every bit as at peace with the world as that first night back we\u2019d spent together and simply stayed awake in each other\u2019s embrace.\n\nShe was precious like this.\n\nI must have fallen asleep at some point, because I don\u2019t remember admiring the view for long. The next thing I remember is Lucy\u2019s exuberant call waking me up at the crack of dawn. \u201cMorning, Anon! Time to get up!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? What time is it?\u201d I asked groggily. It was Sunday, I was pretty sure. No work.\n\n\u201cTime for you to get up,\u201d She repeated mischievously.  \u201cCome on, get your butt up off the bed. We\u2019ve got mass today, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right! Right,\u201d I got halfway up from under the blanket before I suddenly felt the bitter morning chill and retreated. \u201cUh... How about five more minutes.\u201d\n\nLucy folded her arms and cocked her head, eyebrows raised tauntingly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get up right now I\u2019m pulling that blanket right off.\u201d\n\nI froze up. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. You couldn\u2019t,\u201d I pleaded.\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. Instead, faster than I could see, she reached down and swiped the blanket away. I instinctively curled up a bit at the shock of cold that hit me, prompting a burst of laughter from her as she dropped the sheet back down in a heap on the floor.\n\n\u201cCome on, lazy ass. I\u2019m already getting breakfast ready, you could at least get up and eat it,\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019m getting up,\u201d I groaned, utterly defeated.\n\nBreakfast wasn\u2019t anything too crazy, with what little we had in the house, but the hot porridge helped chase away the cold. Lucy kept talking breezily as we sat down to eat.\n\n\u201cI think we should go and do some grocery shopping after mass. We need to get some stuff to put in the fridge before we finish unpacking. We don\u2019t have any dino nuggies, for one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeaven forbid you don\u2019t get your nuggies.\u201d I chuckled. Some things just didn\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cI need my nuggies, Anon!\u201d She pointed her spoon at me with mock seriousness. \u201cI\u2019ll go crazy without \u2018em!\u201d\n\nThe drive to the local church was quiet, but short \u2013 that was one of the reasons Lucy had been interested in the apartment in the first place. Previously we\u2019d both tagged along with Lucy\u2019s parents as they went to their local Sunday service, but now we were on our own. Our new church was an old building, not a trace of modernity to it at all \u2013 tall and ivy-covered, proudly bearing the proof of its endurance through the test of time.\n\nDefinitely a far cry from Skin Row.\n\nThe old triceratops pastor welcomed us in before the congregation began just as he had last week, and while Lucy returned the greeting enthusiastically, I still felt a little out of place. Lucy seemed to love it here, from how insistent she was about attending, but this wasn\u2019t exactly my element. We took our seats together amongst the rows of pews, up near the front where Lucy wanted. I sat patiently through the service, kneeling and genuflecting when it was called for \u2013 even if I didn\u2019t believe, I had respect for what Lucy had respect for.\n\nTowards the end of mass, though, my attention wandered a bit. My gaze fell upon the wooden pipe organ near the altar, off in the corner. I couldn\u2019t help but notice... well, how much it looked like a piano. A little larger, a little more ostentatious looking \u2013 and it looked like it had two rows of keys instead of just one. I wondered how much more complex it was to play than a regular piano.\n\n... I wondered if Lucy would know.\n\nBut it would be rude to ask in the middle of a service, so I held my breath until the pastor had given his last word and sent us off. As we shuffled out of the rows and made to join the crowd heading out of the building, I tugged her sleeve back and pointed.\n\n\u201cHey, Lucy. You seen that?\u201d\n\nShe followed my gaze. \u201cYeah? It\u2019s an organ,\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know how to play it?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cSort of. I mean, it\u2019s kinda harder than a piano, but kinda easier. There\u2019s less keys, but that can make it harder to find the notes you want. And they\u2019re in different places.\u201d\n\nFor a second I was actually distracted. \u201cWait, less? There\u2019s two whole rows on that thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but they\u2019ve got less keys on them each. Maths, Anon? You know that stuff?\u201d She laughed.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201c... I was just wondering if you\u2019d be able to play our song on it.\u201d\n\nShe eyed the instrument tentatively for a moment. \u201cHmmm... I dunno. Maybe? I could try \u2013\u201d\n\nAs though on autopilot she took one step toward it, then seemed to catch herself and freeze. It was like she\u2019d just suddenly realized exactly what she was talking about.\n\n\u201cI, ah... I don\u2019t know if I want to,\u201d She said. She was facing away from me but I could hear the sudden shot of nerves in her voice.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d I assured her. \u201cI just thought we could ask is all. Just if you\u2019re up for it,\u201d\n\nShe turned back to me then, and I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what I saw on her face. Trepidation? Fear? Panic? All of the above perhaps, but behind it there was something more welcome. Something earnest, something that still hoped for better. Her gaze met mine for a moment, before falling away.\n\nShe stayed silent, waiting for me to answer, but I didn\u2019t know what answer to give. I wasn\u2019t sure if I should push it or not. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was right or wrong to ask more of her. I was certain she wasn\u2019t really happy, having left music behind completely.\n\nBut wasn\u2019t that her decision to make?\n\n\u201c...Do you want to ask the pastor and see what he says?\u201d I finally asked.\n\nShe turned away to face the organ again, and was silent for a long while. The crowd had long since left the church, leaving just us and the old pastor, looking curiously down at us from beside the altar.\n\nShe sucked in a deep breath. \u201c... Yeah. Yeah, sure. Can\u2019t hurt to ask.\u201d\n\nIt was a weight off my heart to hear her say that. It was a relief to know that on some level, to some degree she still hoped for better just like I did. I came up beside her and wrapped one arm around her shoulders, and in response she drew me in closer with one wing as we walked up to the altar together.\n\n\u201cGood morning, Lucy and... Anon, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d The leathery old triceratops asked. I nodded my affirmation. Lucy had talked to him a little bit last week, but I hadn\u2019t, and I was surprised he remembered my name at all. \u201cExcellent. Forgive me, I\u2019m poor with names at the best of times. I\u2019m glad to see you both again. Was there something about the sermon you wanted to discuss?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Father,\u201d Lucy spoke hesitantly, looking up at me uncertainly for a brief moment before continuing. \u201cI was... actually just wondering... if I could be allowed to play a song on the organ?\u201d\n\nHe seemed taken aback for a moment, but nodded graciously. \u201cCertainly. I didn\u2019t know you played,\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t, really, I\u2019ve only really played piano,\u201d She murmured as she sat down and smoothed her dress out. \u201cI know they\u2019re similar, though,\u201d\n\nHer fingers brushed tentatively over the keys at first, and for a while her notes were purely experimental, little more than deep, bassy noise as she figured her way around the keys. The pastor and I both sat quietly on the front pew as she worked through her practice, finding rhythms and dropping them as fast again.\n\nI could see a small smile on her face as she focused, and it brought a smile to my own. This was her element.\n\nFinally she let out a long exhale and leaned back. \u201cAlright, I think I might be able to... Let me see...\u201d\n\nShe began more slowly than she had on piano or guitar, letting the deep thrum of the organ\u2019s voice resonate through the tremendous old building. The difference between her practicing and her playing was immediately apparent \u2013 the melody surrounded us, momentous in a way I\u2019d never heard it before, demanding utter attention from its rapt listeners. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes away from Lucy as she seemingly channelled her soul into the music. Before long she was throwing her back into it, as consumed by the music as myself and the pastor.\n\nIt brought me back to better times. Before I\u2019d gone away to the desert. Before I\u2019d left Lucy alone. She\u2019d called herself broken since I left, but I could see in her right now the same spirit as I had when she\u2019d played before.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but wonder what might have happened if I\u2019d done things even a little differently. I heard in the music all the things that never were, the heights she could have reached if things had gone as she\u2019d deserved.\n\nThe last reverent note fell away slowly, and I let out a breath I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been holding. Even on an instrument she wasn\u2019t familiar with, she\u2019d commanded the music with aplomb.\n\nShe looked exhilarated as she turned back to face me, a broad smile running across her face.\n\n\u201cThat was astounding,\u201d The old pastor broke the stunned silence. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you played at all, but you\u2019ve got quite the talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I \u2013\u201d She chuckled, rubbing her neck embarrassedly. \u201cIt\u2019s not as different from the piano as I thought. I haven\u2019t really played organ much...\u201d\n\n\u201cThat only makes it even more impressive, really. I\u2019ve never heard anything quite like that. Have you ever considered playing for the choir?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t...\u201d She murmured, looking my way for a moment. I gave her an assuring nod. \u201c... But I think I could, maybe.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvery week since then she played the organ for the Sunday mass. We had to leave even earlier in the morning to make sure everything was set up properly, and our Saturday mornings were spent on rehearsal with the choir. Or rather, her Saturday mornings were spent on rehearsal, while I sat in the rows and looked on.\n\nI was happy to be there. I wanted to support her, I didn\u2019t want to leave her alone any more than she wanted to face the music on her own.\n\nDespite playing to perfection each time, she always looked nervous before each service, and exhausted afterwards. An hour or so later she would be back to her peppy self, but I was beginning to suspect lately that she was putting on a front to at least some degree. She\u2019d never really spoken excitedly of getting to play for the choir, not once said she was happy doing what she was doing.\n\nAfter that performance she\u2019d poured her heart into, I\u2019d thought the choir might simply bring her out of her shell a little bit. Now, though,  I was growing concerned that it might be taking more of a toll on her than I\u2019d realized.\n\n\u201cAre you alright, Lucy?\u201d After our third mass at that church, I decided to ask her about it as I drove us home.\n\n\u201c... I\u2019m alright. It\u2019s just... exhausting, Anon,\u201d She murmured after a moment, looking vacantly ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as when I played our song. I feel like I\u2019m dying a bit every time I go up there and play.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? But you play so well. It always sounds amazing,\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d She gave me a small smile, but it fell as quickly as it had come. \u201c... I\u2019m sorry. I should be enjoying it, I know, but... it only feels like hard work.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to be sorry for. If you\u2019re not comfortable doing it, we should talk to the pastor about it.\u201d\n\nShe shook her head vehemently. \u201cNo! I can do it. It\u2019s just... harder than it should be, is all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to push yourself if you\u2019re not ready, Lucy.\u201d I reminded her gently. \u201cIt\u2019s better to take it slow.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I can\u2019t just let everyone down like that,\u201d She insisted, wringing her hands in her lap. \u201c... I\u2019ve been doing that way too long as it is. Now you\u2019re here, I... I have to really try.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to feel. Did she really want to go to that kind of length just for me? Only for my sake \u2013 not for hers? On some level I was touched, but I didn\u2019t want to think that she only playing because she felt she had to, that she felt some sense of obligation to show the church her music instead of any real want to do it.\n\n\u201c... You should only do it if it makes you happy, Lucy,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cNot if it makes anyone else happy. Not even me.\u201d\n\nShe was silent for almost a minute, keeping her head down as I kept my eyes on the road.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what makes me happy anymore, Anon,\u201d She whispered finally. \u201cI really don\u2019t. I love working with the preschoolers, but I always feel like I\u2019m just wasting my time doing nothing. I can\u2019t stop them from growing up and fucking up like us. And I don\u2019t... Well, I don\u2019t even really like playing music. I know I\u2019m good at it, but it just doesn\u2019t make me happy. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\n\nShe heaved a great breath before she continued, words spilling out of her. \u201cI know I\u2019m meant to be doing something, but I don\u2019t know what. I should have tried to be a star or something, but I just couldn\u2019t. I miss the band, I miss Trish and Reed, but... but at the same time, I can\u2019t stand the thought of them both. Trish tried to screw my whole life up, and Reed... he just let her.\u201d\n\nIn the car I couldn\u2019t do much more than give her a reassuring squeeze. \u201cHey \u2013 It\u2019s alright. Don\u2019t beat yourself up about what happened in the past. We\u2019ll get through this. We\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. I know we will. It just all hurts,\u201d She sighed, a wisp of a smile in her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re the only thing I really know anymore, Anon. I love you.\u201d\n\nDespite my worry it still sent a thrill through me just to hear her say that. \u201cI love you too, Lucy.\u201d\n\n \n\nAs usual, the mask came back on, and Lucy returned to her exuberant self within a few minutes of us arriving home.  We did some shopping together, cooked dinner, went for a short evening walk, watched television for a short while. A perfectly normal day, and she gave no indication that it was anything more or less than that, but I could feel an undercurrent to it. Words that neither of us wanted to speak or hear spoken. We both just wanted to be normal. We both wanted to feel happy.\n\nAnd the happiness we had was genuine enough that neither of us could stand to disrupt it.\n\nI pulled her close as we slept that night, and I couldn\u2019t say that it was entirely for her comfort alone. I didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to do for her. Her weight against my side and her wing draped over us beneath the blanket was just barely a reassuring enough presence to lull me to sleep.\n\nShe was still the woman I loved, no matter what. And she was still there.\n\nIn the early morning, however, she wasn\u2019t. In the dull hazy state of being half-awake, the first thing I noticed was that she was gone, and I jolted out of bed in a panic.\n\n\u201cAnon?\u201d I heard her quiet voice in the gloom. I was instantly relieved that she was still there.\n\nI flicked on the lamp on our bedside table and looked over to see her standing by the window, looking back over her shoulder at me with a wan smile. It was raining gently outside, streaking down the window and casting the world in grey.\n\n\u201cLucy?\u201d\n\nShe turned back to the window, ruffling her wings slightly before letting them droop back down. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Anon. I\u2019m right here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d I asked, throwing the blanket off and ignoring the cold as I slowly picked myself up out of bed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. Before the sun came up,\u201d She murmured.\n\n\u201c... What are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust watching the rain. I couldn\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m sorry if I upset you, Anon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not upset, don\u2019t worry. I was just confused for a second,\u201d I reassured her as I came up beside her. Almost immediately she reached out with both an arm and a wing, pulling me in close and leaning against me as if her life depended on it. \u201cDid you have a nightmare?\u201d\n\n\u201cN-No, I just...\u201d Her voice cracked for a second, and she gulped audibly before forcing herself to keep going. \u201cIt\u2019s just... m-my... my wings were so itchy... But I don\u2019t want to \u2013 to... I promised not to...\u201d\n\nI swear I felt my blood chilling in my veins. Immediately I thought back to the time I\u2019d sat on the blood-speckled rooftop of Volcano High with her, all ripped wings and scattered feathers and heartfelt honesty. Almost on instinct I pulled her in closer, prompting another wracking sob from her as she buried her head into my chest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Lucy,\u201d I whispered to her. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Talk to me. Tell me about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just \u2013 I fucking \u2013 I just want \u2013\u201d A hiccup punctuated each long-repressed sob. \u201cI just want to be happy again but I just don\u2019t know how anymore. I... I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing anymore! I can\u2019t be a good wife for you, I don\u2019t know how. I\u2019m just... living the same way I always have and trying to copy my mom, but I feel like an idiot all the time! I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing anything right, and I can\u2019t even play music like I used to anymore...\u201d\n\nThe words fell out of her in an unstemmable tide \u2013 so I didn\u2019t try. I just held her tightly and rocked us both gently as we stood, offering what comfort I could and hoping that it was enough for the pain and grief to escape her.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t improved myself at all. I\u2019m the same shit person as before, always fucking things up for everyone. I haven\u2019t gotten anywhere with anything in three years, Anon. I just fell apart and I never got anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fuck things up for me, Lucy. I\u2019ll never think that.\u201d I believed that with all my heart, and wanted nothing more than to convince her of it, too. I just didn\u2019t know how. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of love to give, and I wish you could see that you deserve as much for yourself as you give to me.\u201d\n\nShe looked up at me miserably. \u201cBut I don\u2019t deserve it, Anon. I\u2019m broken. You\u2019re the only thing that\u2019s still good in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re broken, Lucy. I think you\u2019re way stronger than you believe.\u201d I said, trying my utmost to let the certainty of truth through into my words. \u201cLife\u2019s just hard sometimes. Holding on as well as you have is more than you can ask out of a lot of people. You\u2019re tougher than you think you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy life\u2019s not that \u2013\u201d She started to voice her protest, but abruptly stopped as a look of realization stole over her tear-stained face. \u201cAnon...  I\u2019ve never asked. But I should have. What was it like while you were in the desert?\u201d\n\nThose memories were the last things I wanted to dredge up at this moment, but how could I just blow her off when she asked? She\u2019d seen my scars before, of course she had \u2013 we shared a bed. But I\u2019d never told her the stories of how I\u2019d gotten them, for one simple reason.\n\nAs far as I was concerned, they didn\u2019t have any stories. They were just things. Things I\u2019d moved past and allowed myself to forget. Things I\u2019d never wanted to dwell on, because I knew if I had, they would have become a part of me. The only thing I allowed myself to remember about them was thinking once in the infirmary that if I let myself think about them any more than I had, I wouldn\u2019t be able to go back to a life without them.\n\n\u201c... Hard,\u201d I said finally, earning a reluctant, choked-up chuckle from her as I struggled to think of something serious to say. \u201cIt... Well, no, it really was hard. I did a lot of things I\u2019m not happy with. But I did what I had to, I got through it, and... it\u2019s over now. I\u2019m back here.\u201d\n\nHer question came slowly, and full of fearful trepidation. \u201cDid... Did you ever shoot anyone?\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to answer or not. \u201c... Yeah. Yeah, I did.\u201d\n\nShe looked up at me wide-eyed. \u201c... What was it like?\u201d\n\nIt was a million things all at once, none of which I wanted to say. God, none of which could probably do it justice even if I did say them. I couldn\u2019t convey everything that had run through my head after I\u2019d taken my first shot at a real person, all the long hours I\u2019d spent trying to sort through those emotions in my head, and the even longer hours trying to push myself not to dwell on them. I liked to think I\u2019d done a pretty good job. I\u2019d come away from shit that broke a lot of people intact, both physically and mentally \u2013 as far as I could tell anyway. But all that hard work would come undone if I let it. If I forgot it, and lived my life without it \u2013 well, that was as much as anyone could ask for.\n\n\u201cBad.\u201d I shook my head dumbly. \u201cJust... bad. I get that sounds stupid, but I really can\u2019t put it any better than that, Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll those scars you got...\u201d My heart fell even further in my chest. I knew what she was about to say. \u201c... You got shot at too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I did. Not all of them were from that, but... Yeah.\u201d\n\nShe fell silent for a long moment, her head downcast as she turned her gaze back out the window.\n\n\u201cGod, Anon. My life\u2019s nowhere near as hard as what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d She murmured tonelessly. \u201cI got no right to be complaining next to you. My life\u2019s been nothing in comparison.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Just because I\u2019ve been in some shit, doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t been in any.\u201d I said firmly. \u201cNo point in comparing how hard or easy our lives have been. Someone else struggling harder than you doesn\u2019t mean you still aren\u2019t struggling yourself. I really am so impressed with how well you\u2019ve done for yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201c... I just don\u2019t understand how you think that, Anon,\u201d Her voice was barely a whisper as she let her head droop down against my chest again. \u201cCompared to everyone else, I\u2019m useless. My mom, my brother, y-you...\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not, Lucy. You\u2019ve got to stop thinking like that. I can\u2019t stand seeing you hurt yourself like this,\u201d I insisted quietly as I ran one hand through her long hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve just been going through some rough times, but that\u2019ll change. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\nShe seemed to relax somewhat in my arms then. I\u2019m not certain how long we stayed together like that, just standing and watching the rain patter down against the window. Neither of us spoke, and by degrees her staccato sobs slowed and stopped. Even then I didn\u2019t want to pull away, though.\n\nIt wrenched my heart to hear her putting herself down like this. I wanted to help her, but I didn\u2019t know how. I could tell her to be proud of herself and happy with what she\u2019d managed until I was blue in the face, but it wouldn\u2019t help if she just didn\u2019t want to do it. There was still a flame within her, sputtering slightly but burning hot \u2013 but it was burning her up from the inside. The pride and strength I\u2019d come to see in her that semester in Volcano High was undoubtedly still there, but she now feared it, hated it, and refused to acknowledge it.\n\nI didn\u2019t understand. All I knew for certain was that something had to give. She felt more fragile than ever as I held her that morning, like she might have collapsed under the weight of a single raindrop. Like she bore an unspeakable, invisible agony that made her frail and brittle enough to simply fall apart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to forget the pain, Lucy. Keep  the happy memories, but forget the pain,\u201d I felt compelled to speak as that thought hit me. A younger me might never have said it, but after what I\u2019d been through, I knew it for a fact. There was just no other way. \u201cTrust me. What\u2019s done is done. There\u2019s no good in dwelling on it, no matter how bad it was. Forget the pain, but remember the good times. Remember what they used to mean to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow? How do you do that?\u201d She looked up at me again, a hint of red desperation in her amber eyes.\n\n\u201cThinking of something else. For me in the desert, it was thinking of you. Thinking of how I wanted to come back and see you, and how good my life would be again once I did.\u201d I drew her in tight again. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t disappointed me, Lucy. You\u2019re nowhere near useless. You\u2019ve got no idea how happy you make me.\u201d\n\n\u201c... Thank you, Anon,\u201d I saw the faintest beginnings of a wan smile on her face. \u201cI\u2019m alright now. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, it\u2019s alright,\u201d I reassured her again. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you, Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, I just don\u2019t want to be a bother,\u201d She said as she pulled away at last. \u201cAnd, anyway... we both have to go to work. It\u2019s probably about time we started getting ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re alright to?\u201d I asked her gently.\n\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be okay,\u201d She insisted, looking up at me with a wan smile. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be okay today, Anon. Come on \u2013 I\u2019ll get started on breakfast.\u201d\n\n \n\nAfter work that day, I made another stop. Well, to be honest I shouldn\u2019t call it work. Technically recruitment was still duty, but it felt a lot more like work than active service, so hell, it may as well be work.\n\nWhenever I hadn\u2019t been busy, I\u2019d been thinking of Lucy. She was instantly on my mind when there as nothing else to occupy it. I\u2019d considered sending her a message earlier in the day to ask how she had been going, but decided against it. She\u2019d promised she\u2019d be okay. If I couldn\u2019t trust her on that, how could I trust her on anything? And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that if I was going to help her at all, I really was going to have to trust her.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tear down the walls she\u2019d put up to protect herself. The thought of that felt like an irredeemable overstepping of boundaries. It simply wasn\u2019t my place to make that call for her, but it might be possible for me to show her she didn\u2019t need those walls. If I could just show her the resilience I knew she had, if she could realize exactly how tough a person she was, she would be able to decide to hammer them down herself.\n\n... or she could decide not to. The thought struck me that the effort might be futile, that she might not want to embrace herself anymore \u2013 or might not even be able to. But when I thought back to yesterday morning, how she\u2019d mentioned feeling tempted to preen again, I knew I couldn\u2019t just leave her to suffer. She wasn\u2019t happy. She needed to be offered the choice... and I needed to accept it if she refused.\n\nIt was her call to make at the end of the day. Not mine.\n\nThe solution had to lie at Volcano High. Over the years I\u2019d been away, Lucy had cut herself off from the world, but in that semester, she\u2019d been growing steadily more outgoing, more confident, more... genuine, I supposed. Right up until that last night, wherein I was starting to suspect she\u2019d been so badly shaken that she\u2019d felt she had no choice but to back away from life entirely.\n\nI had a feeling I might know where the crux of the issue was. I had to talk to Trish.\n\n... Finding her was another matter, of course. I had no idea where she\u2019d gone since that semester. She\u2019d ducked out of prom night just like Lucy and I had, and she\u2019d been as good as her promise. To my knowledge she\u2019d not spoken to Lucy since then. I remembered her words, though. She only wanted Lucy to be happy, she\u2019d said.\n\nI hoped she hadn\u2019t changed her mind over the years. I hoped I could locate her to find out.\n\nAnd so I found myself at the base of the long stairway up to the school. The building hadn\u2019t changed much at all, still as tall and ivy-covered as the last day I\u2019d seen it. It was past school hours now so the place appeared quiet, but the office should still be open.\n\nA fearful flicker of doubt nagged at me as I climbed the stairs, telling me that the trepid woman I\u2019d married was the true Lucy, the happier Lucy, and that the confidence of her Fang persona was nothing more than an act. I couldn\u2019t shake the thought of the way she\u2019d acted in that semester being nothing more than a mask she\u2019d put on to hide her weakness.\n\nBut I had to believe in the strength of that flickering flame I knew was there. I had to trust that she was strong enough not to snap and hide behind her new mask of happiness forever.\n\nWith a steeling breath, I walked through the sliding doors and headed over towards the reception. A vaguely familiar lime green stegosaurus was behind the desk, busily tapping away on a keyboard. She left her work and turned her attention to me with a polite smile as I approached.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, can I help \u2013\u201d The voice clinched it. Seemingly at the same time as I recognized her, Stella recognized me. Immediately her eyes lit up and her clearly practiced demanour vanished. \u201cAnon! Hey! It\u2019s you! How have you been? Where have you been? I thought you died!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thought I died?\u201d I asked, bewildered for a moment. That was where she jumped to?\n\nStella had never seemed to be entirely there, as I remembered her. She walked to her own beat, did her own thing, and owned it completely. Never seemed to have a care for what anyone thought of her. I\u2019d kind of envied her for that, even if just seeing her reminded me unpleasantly of my own weeb phase. It was good to see that even now she still seemed exactly as I remembered her.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, you just went totally off the grid, Anon! I tried to keep in contact with everyone from school, but I couldn\u2019t get a hold of you. You and a few other people,\u201d She explained, a slightly fretful note in her voice despite the smile on her face. \u201cWow, I remember you being a lot less bulky. What have you been doing with yourself all this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry about that, Stella. I\u2019ve been deployed,\u201d I answered with a shrug.\n\n\u201cDeployed? Like in the army? Wow, that\u2019s pretty cool! I never would have thought you\u2019d end up going that way in life.\u201d She remarked with an impressed look. \u201cI guess that\u2019d explain the silence, though. What was it like? Was it exciting?\u201d\n\nI cringed inwardly. \u201c... Exciting\u2019s one word for it, sure. It wasn\u2019t exactly a holiday, though, Stella.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d She asked excitedly, before the realization of what she was asking very visibly hit her. \u201cOh. Oh, right. Sorry...\u201d\n\nI waved her off. I just wanted to move the conversation away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. What about you? How long have you been working here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, a few years now. I was just an assistant at first, but look at me now \u2013 on the front desk, all by myself!\u201d She threw her arms out and beamed proudly. \u201cI gotta say though, it does feel kinda strange. Do you know what I mean? I mean, I used to go to this school, and now I\u2019m still here, but on staff instead. It\u2019s weird how life works out sometimes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t it just, I didn\u2019t say. \u201cNeat. What else have you been up to? Still doing your tarot readings and stuff?\u201d\n\nTo my surprise, she gave a small shrug. \u201cOh, well... Not so much, really. I never had much chance to do readings for anybody after graduation, except Rosa, but I can tell she gets tired of it. I\u2019ve sort of just... stopped with that stuff, I guess.\u201d\n\nI was taken aback. Maybe not exactly as I remembered, then. Was everybody I knew just giving things up? \u201cWhat about those good old Chinese cartoons you used to love?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re Japanese, Anon, and I know you know that full well!\u201d A mischievous smile ran across her beaked face. \u201cI still haven\u2019t forgotten that presentation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh god, I\u2019d hoped people would have by now...\u201d I groaned.\n\n\u201cMaybe everyone else will, but not me! I wasn\u2019t lying by the way, she really is a great waifu and I really do love her. \u201d\n\n\u201cGee, thanks, Stella,\u201d I chuckled embarrassedly. Once again I felt like this conversation had to move along, the faster the better.\n\nStella, on the other hand, didn\u2019t seem to feel that at all, her smile only growing wider. \u201cHave you ever seen ToraDora, Anon? I watched it just recently, it\u2019s great! You should come over sometime and we can watch it together, I\u2019ve been trying to get Rosa to but she just won\u2019t. If you were there, though... I mean, she\u2019d like to see you again too, I bet!\u201d\n\n\u201c... Maybe some other time. I actually came her to ask you something, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nHer brows furrowed. \u201cOh. Sure, what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just wondering if it would be possible to get a hold of any of Trish\u2019s contact details,\u201d I asked slowly. Now that I thought about it, I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how to explain why I wanted them. Hopefully she just wouldn\u2019t ask.\n\n\u201cTrish? Hm, I remember her. She\u2019s another one I haven\u2019t talked to since graduation... What did you want to talk to her about? If you don\u2019t mind me asking. Is it about the presentation?\u201d\n\nDamn. \u201cNo, it\u2019s... for Lucy\u2019s sake,\u201d\n\n\u201cLucy...? Oh, Fang, right!  I remember!\u201d She gasped. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten her actual name, sorry... Are you and her still together? I haven\u2019t gotten to talk to her either, is she going by Lucy again? That\u2019s... good! I think?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just going through a bit of a rough time right now,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of why I was hoping you could point me towards Trish. They didn\u2019t part on the best of terms...\u201d\n\nShe looked up at me uncomfortably for a moment. \u201c... Uh, well... Strictly speaking I\u2019m not supposed to give you anything like that unless there\u2019s a real serious reason, Anon, since you don\u2019t have any relation to her. I could probably get in big trouble for that... Also, any details I gave you would be out of date by now, you know. She hasn\u2019t been here for three years, after all,\u201d\n\nMy crestfallen look must have shown on my face, because she immediately resumed talking without waiting for a response.\n\n\u201cBut! ... For Fang \u2013 er, Lucy\u2019s sake, I\u2019d be happy to give you what I\u2019ve got. Just as long as you don\u2019t tell anybody who told you...\u201d\n\n\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d A spark of hope was blooming in my chest.\n\n\u201cAlright, just give me a minute here, I\u2019ll look it up...\u201d She turned her attention back to her computer. \u201cHey, uh... When you and her have time... if she doesn\u2019t mind... would it be okay if I called you guys sometime? Like I said, I\u2019m trying to keep in contact with people from school. It\u2019d be great to talk to you guys again...\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, Stella, but... maybe not for a little while, alright?\u201d I answered. Her face fell and immediately I felt guilty. The last thing I wanted was to fob her off when she\u2019d been nothing but nice. \u201cWe can swap numbers if you got a bit of paper spare, but... well, we just might not be able to call for a while.\u201d\n\nShe brightened up again slightly, quickly passing me a blank sticky note and a pen. \u201cSure! Yeah, that\u2019s fine, it doesn\u2019t have to be tomorrow or anything. I\u2019d just like to see you guys again. Rosa would, too,\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019d be nice. How\u2019s she going, by the way? \u201d I asked as I scrawled my number down.\n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s just peachy. I still talk to her every other day. She runs a florist\u2019s now!\u201d She seemed to find what she was looking for on the computer with a satisfied noise, reaching across her desk again for another sticky note. She spared me a glance as she did. \u201cMaybe sometime we can all meet up and catch up with each other. That\u2019d be fun,\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d I concurred. \u201cJust...\u201d\n\n\u201cNot right now, I know,\u201d she nodded sagely as she passed me her note. \u201cHere. This is her last home number and address we\u2019ve got. And mine\u2019s on the back.\u201d\n\nI pocketed it gratefully, and handed her my own in turn. \u201cThanks Stella. I really appreciate this,\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem, Anon. I better get back to work, but hey... Don\u2019t run off again, alright? It was really nice to see you again after all this time. And tell Lucy I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from her, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHey, Anon! Dinner\u2019s done!\u201d Lucy called from the kitchen.\n\n\u201cComing!\u201d I called back, putting down the papers I\u2019d been flicking through.\n\nIn truth I hadn\u2019t really needed to be doing anything. These enlisted dossiers didn\u2019t need to be sorted through right away. Lucy had shooed me out of the kitchen when I\u2019d offered to help, insisting that it was her job and I should leave her to it. I wasn\u2019t sure how to argue without seeming like a jerkass, so I\u2019d left her to it as she said, but that left me with nothing to do. It didn\u2019t feel right for me to be doing nothing while she worked, even if it was what she wanted, and as a result, I\u2019d turned to doing work that didn\u2019t need to be done for a good while yet.\n\nIt struck me that she might be trying a bit too hard at this. I didn\u2019t exactly need a big, fancy dinner every other night to be happy. In fact I\u2019d probably just end up getting fat that way, and it wasn\u2019t like I couldn\u2019t cook myself in any case. I wasn\u2019t sure how to say that to her, though. She seemed so proud of herself when she did this kind of thing. Normal, domestic stuff. Wife stuff, I supposed. It was such a far cry from the Fang of old, but she went about it with such aplomb that some days I had to admit I\u2019d found myself really asking whether that had been the true Lucy, or whether this was her now in front of me.\n\nIt almost felt like poison to my own mind just thinking it, but she seemed so in her element now. She always talked about her day at the kindergarten so enthusiastically, laughing her head off as she told me all about what mischief the kids had been up to that day. She would listen intently even if I had barely anything to tell her about my own day in turn. She cooked to perfection each night, and she kept the apartment clean with a zeal that reminded me of Rosa tending to her flowers back at school. She was going above and beyond.\n\nBut always the mask slipped off, and always just when she thought I wasn\u2019t looking. The way her face would harden with bitterness sometimes sent a chill down my spine, and whenever I saw her vacantly staring out into nothingness, wrapped up in something she didn\u2019t want to share, I could swear I felt that chill spread through the whole room. After the episode this morning, with her thoughts of self-harm returning in force, I knew for certain it was hollow. I knew she was doing it all for my sake, not for her own.\n\nI thought back to that day I first reunited with her, when she told me of how badly she\u2019d suffered alone. She wasn\u2019t meant to be like this. She wasn\u2019t happy; she was distracted. Even I could tell she poured such energy into these simple tasks not finding fulfilment in them, only hoping that she would someday down the line. She had such a spark within her, but so little light made it out to the surface now.\n\nSomething had to give, sooner or later. I couldn\u2019t bear it if she broke down entirely.\n\nIn contrast to my heavy thoughts, she looked particularly exuberant as I entered the room, humming a tune to herself as she plated up. The warmth of the kitchen was comforting in a way I couldn\u2019t explain as I sat down at the table.\n\n\u201cRoast veggies and meat loaf,\u201d She announced happily. \u201cHomemade, too. The good stuff, Anon. So if you tell me it\u2019s anything less than perfect, I\u2019ll have to kick your ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it, Lucy,\u201d I let myself laugh along with her.\n\nShe continued chattering as we started eating. \u201cSo the silliest thing happened at work today. Julian \u2013 I don\u2019t remember if I\u2019ve told you about him, the little stegosaur, big troublemaker \u2013 I got him a cup of water, and he just ran outside straight away and tipped it up in the sandpit. And then, right, he takes the mud, or sand mud, whatever \u2013 and just starts rubbing it all over his face!\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? He sounds like a handful,\u201d I remarked bemusedly. She really did love the kids and their antics, and she loved regaling me with tales about them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not even the half of it. This was like ten minutes before home time, so we just barely managed to get him cleaned up in time. Anyway, his parents come in and pick him up, and as they\u2019re leaving he pulls away and dives right back into it. Face first.\u201d\n\nThat actually got a snort out of me. This kid was definitely going places. \u201cDid you have to \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cYep, we had to clean him up again,\u201d Lucy had a mock grimace on her face as she interjected  before bursting into a fit of sniggers. \u201cThey kept him in an iron grip when they were walking him out the second time, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood thing they did, imagine having to clean him up three times.\u201d I said in between bites of meat loaf. It was as good as anything else she\u2019d ever put up on a plate. I couldn\u2019t deny she had a talent for cooking.\n\n\u201cPass, pass, and pass.\u201d Lucy laughed. \u201cWhat about you? How was work?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally slow. Mostly just paperwork. Planning for an event next month,\u201d I shrugged.\n\n\u201cHow come you were so late back, then? Was there that much?\u201d She asked curiously, taking her eyes off the plate for a moment.\n\nI knew she wouldn\u2019t like to hear it, but I was going to have to say it eventually anyway. \u201cWell... I stopped by Volcano High, actually.\u201d\n\nJust as I\u2019d thought it would, the mood in the room changed instantly. Lucy winced and paused for a moment, immediately on edge at the mere mention of the school. Very slowly she resumed eating, carefully as though trying not to provoke a predator.\n\n\u201c... Oh. What for?\u201d It was plain in her voice that she didn\u2019t want to be part of the conversation anymore, but neither did she want to pretend anything was wrong.\n\nI heaved a sigh and decided to rip the bandage off. \u201cLucy, I think you should talk to Trish.\u201d\n\nNow she froze up completely, beak halfway open, eyes trained on her fork halfway up to her mouth. \u201c... Why? I don\u2019t want to talk to her, Anon. I don\u2019t need her anymore, after what she did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2013 Look, Lucy. You haven\u2019t been the same since I got back. You said it yourself, you feel like you\u2019re broken,\u201d Her face contorted in a pained grimace as she put her fork back down and stared at her plate. I felt like the biggest piece of shit on the face of the earth saying that, but it had to be said. \u201cI just think \u2013 if you think you are broken, then it might help put you back together. You\u2019re not happy like this, I can see how it\u2019s still hurting you. I can see you carry that weight around every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to talk to her, Anon,\u201d She whimpered. \u201cShe nearly screwed my whole life up. Everyone just hated me more when I started doing that non-binary shit, and she just kept pushing me into it. I didn\u2019t even realize she was doing it until you came along, but she was! The whole time, she was...\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she realized it either, Lucy,\u201d I said gently. \u201cI remember I talked to her that night at prom, after she tried to pull you up on stage. She told me she was only trying to help, and \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Trying to help\u2019? Yeah, right,\u201d Lucy snapped, an ember of anger appearing in her amber eyes. I heard the faintest trace of that old fire in her words coming through. \u201cThe way she kept talking shit about Naser when he was the one really trying to help \u2013 I pretty much let her run my life for years because I thought she was so smart, but she was just even stupider and nastier than I was. And that day she said to me \u2018I think you might be non-binary\u2019 \u2013 that was the day everything really started going wrong. If I\u2019d never listened to her, I wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near as broken as I am now! And just think of if I\u2019d kept listening, where would I be \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said she only wanted to help,\u201d I interjected again, quieter. Thankfully, Lucy stopped to listen. \u201cAnd she said she was sorry, and that she didn\u2019t want to hurt you anymore, so she would leave you alone.\u201d\n\nLucy\u2019s eyes widened in shock. For a moment she only stared at me, jaw slack and brows furrowed as she visibly processed that. I wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d want to believe it \u2013 after prom, neither her nor I had wanted to talk about it. Back then, I\u2019d thought it might be better if she\u2019d had some time to put it behind her, just like she\u2019d wanted when she\u2019d taken a break from the band. Back then it had felt like we\u2019d finally earned our peace from Trish\u2019s machinations, but now, three-odd years later, I found myself wondering if I shouldn\u2019t have thought of what she\u2019d needed \u2013 not what she wanted.\n\nI\u2019d tried my best with what I had back then, but after all was said and done, I\u2019d still just been a dumb kid.\n\n \u201c... Well, what\u2019s it matter? Even if she didn\u2019t mean to, she still did it,\u201d Lucy finally growled, but I could hear the lack of bite in it. She wanted to be furious, but it was like she couldn\u2019t truly muster that much up. \u201cAnd I still let her. I spent months of my life acting like an emo grunge idiot or something, trying to be a rock star, making everyone hate me. And I spent years trying to make my own family hate me, cause she thought it was a good idea. Years of my life, gone just like that, Anon. Doesn\u2019t matter whether she meant it or not,\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to think like that, before I met you, Lucy.\u201d I murmured, looking down at the table ashamedly. I hadn\u2019t been the best person back then. \u201cPlease, really think about it. I honestly think talking to Trish would help you heal, Lucy.\u201d\n\nShe was silent for a long while, and when I looked up I found her with her eyes cast down just like mine had been, bearing an expression of deep consternation.  I couldn\u2019t begin to wonder what tumultuous thoughts were running through her head at that moment. The pain ran deeper than I\u2019d ever thought, and she\u2019d spent years letting it into her very core.\n\n\u201cHow do you know? What if it just makes me worse?\u201d She suddenly looked up and asked, desperation tinging her voice. \u201cI \u2013 I just don\u2019t know if I can talk about it. I don\u2019t want to talk to her, Anon. I just want to forget it all ever happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of it, Lucy? She was your friend for so long,\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, that was before she tried to fuck my whole life up, Anon,\u201d She countered with a sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to her, Anon. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should just say what you feel. It\u2019ll only get more confusing if you try to plan it out,\u201d I advised her. I had too much experience with playing conversations in my head.\n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, but...\u201d Lucy shook her head dispiritedly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say what I feel to her. I don\u2019t... I don\u2019t even really know for sure what I feel about her, to be honest, Anon. Everything she did to me... I can\u2019t just let her get away with it. Can I...?\u201d\n\nI shook my head slowly. \u201cStupid she might have been, but I don\u2019t think she ever meant to be nasty, Lucy. I think the only way to know for sure is to ask her... But we don\u2019t have to do it tonight,\u201d\n\nShe let out a heavy exhale. \u201cFuck... I don\u2019t know... These last few years I\u2019ve hated her guts, but if you\u2019re right, then I\u2019ve...\u201d\n\nI nodded. In truth I hadn\u2019t expected her to come around to the idea immediately. \u201cMaybe you should just figure it out in your head a bit first after all. Just please think about it, alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I will, don\u2019t worry about that,\u201d She said with a tiny smile, tentatively picking her utensils back up. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be stopping thinking about it that\u2019s the trick.\u201d\n\n \n\nFor the second time, I woke up in the early morning unpleasantly alone. Lucy was not in bed beside me.\n\nShocked awake, I jolted up and turned to the window where she\u2019d been last time. Just as before she stood in silhouette before the window, her back turned to me. She was quaking quietly, with only a tiny sniffling sound betraying her quiet turmoil.\n\nAs I opened my mouth to say something she shifted abruptly, stretching her left wing out, and then slowly curled it up around in front of her. Ever so slowly her hand came up towards her pristine feathers, and I realized what she was about to do.\n\n\u201cLucy?\u201d\n\nHer name left my mouth out of sheer shock and fear more than anything, but the utterance had the effect I\u2019d desired. Her wings flared out abruptly as she gasped in surprise and looked back over her shoulder at me.\n\n\u201cAnon!?\u201d\n\n\u201cLucy, what\u2019s wrong? Are you alright?\u201d I threw myself up out of bed, hurrying over to join her.\n\n\u201cNo...\u201d Her voice cracked as she forced the words up out of her throat. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2013 It hurts, Anon. It fucking hurts!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? What hurts?\u201d I looked her over as I reached her. I couldn\u2019t see anything wrong physically but she just about collapsed into my arms, now openly sobbing.\n\n\u201cMy head! Everything! I\u2019ve been trying to think but it\u2019s so hard,\u201d She cried. \u201cMy wings keep itching. I can\u2019t focus! All my feathers are itchy! I \u2013 I don\u2019t want to, I know I promised, but \u2013 but if I just pulled a few \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Lucy, please. It would only get worse,\u201d I begged her. \u201cIt might go away for a little bit, but then it would only hurt instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter that than this! It\u2019s just \u2013 all over my wings,\u201d Her breathing was fast and heavy, her sharp fingers flexing. \u201cI need to think, but I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t do anything \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Lucy. Please, it\u2019s alright...\u201d\n\nOnce again I didn\u2019t know what to say to help her. Once again I didn\u2019t know what to do. I felt utterly lost as I held her in my arms, swaying gently in a hopeless attempt to try and soothe her somewhat as she wailed. She felt frail in a way I\u2019d never known her as before as she seemingly fell apart in my arms, her whole body heaving with each wrenching sob.\n\n\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t... I know I promised...\u201d Her eyes were screwed shut as she spoke, as though ashamed of the words. \u201cI just can\u2019t get my thoughts straight. All this stuff with the church, and now Trish... I don\u2019t know what I want anymore, Anon! I wanted to forget high school, and music, and all... all that shit, but now...\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Lucy,\u201d I murmured again. I felt helpless but for repeating that. \u201cYou\u2019re doing alright,\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like it!\u201d She cried out. \u201cI feel like I was supposed to be doing something real, but now I don\u2019t think I ever will. I feel like I\u2019m just a disappointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never disappointed me, Lucy,\u201d\n\nShe drew in a great breath before slowly releasing it. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one,\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about your brother? Your parents?\u201d I pulled back to look her in the eye as I asked her, but she didn\u2019t meet my gaze. \u201cThey don\u2019t expect the world from you, Lucy. They\u2019d probably be happy if you just let yourself be happy with the things you\u2019ve done. And I would too, Lucy. You are a good person.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t I feel like it?\u201d She finally looked up at me, her amber eyes dull with despair. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can help me this time, Anon. I don\u2019t know if anyone can. I\u2019m just... broken. I\u2019m just fucked up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, not to me, you\u2019re not,\u201d I tried to reassure her as I pulled her back in close. I just wanted to remind her that I was still there for her. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before, but I still think you\u2019re the best, Lucy.\u201d\n\nThis time she leaned into me, her wings falling limp back behind her as she rested her head against my shoulder. All of a sudden it was like her energy was utterly spent.\n\n\u201cI kinda thought us getting married would fix everything,\u201d She shrugged dismally. \u201cI really just thought everything would fall into place. I thought I\u2019d be perfectly happy here like this.\u201d\n\n\u201c... Nothing\u2019s ever that easy.\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll still help you in any way I can, though, Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d She said with a wan smile. \u201cI really don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you do. You deserve even more than I can give you,\u201d I guided us back to the bed and we sat together, leaning against each other. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We don\u2019t have to rush with anything, Lucy, we can just take our time. Leave it for tomorrow and see how you feel then, alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d She said with a weak sigh. \u201cI just... I thought I could handle it. It shouldn\u2019t be that hard... I just don\u2019t want to be a burden to anyone anymore. Especially not you,\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a burden, Lucy. Don\u2019t think like that,\u201d I admonished her gently. \u201cSometimes just figuring things out is hard enough. But it\u2019s alright. Like I said, we can just wait until you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nSilence fell between us, and we stayed together for a little while quietly. The sun slowly made its morning ascent, creping up to illuminate the world outside our window. The sun\u2019s orange glow finally lent some small warmth to our room, sending a shiver through me as I finally had time to register just how cold I was. For a moment I was tempted to try and pull the covers up around us, but disturbing Lucy wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\n\nShe seemed to have calmed down at last, her breathing slow and steady against my side. The nerve-wracking start to the morning still felt worth it just to be able to share in a part of her life like this. She really did still have so much warmth to give, and I was starting to get desperate for a way to get her to realize that.\n\nI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever been broken by the world. Rather she\u2019d let pieces of herself fall by the wayside, things she didn\u2019t think she wanted anymore, or that she was better off without \u2013 but she suffered without them. And most of them, I believed, now rested with Trish. Naser had held them once, whether he\u2019d realized it or not. All those years ago, however, Lucy had once had the fortitude to sit down and reconcile with him, and in the doing take back some of what she\u2019d lost.\n\nShe would have to face Trish eventually if she really wanted to put herself back together. I had to believe she still had that fortitude within her to do it. I had to help her, if I could. And I had to believe that Trish would still feel the same way she had back then. Three and a half years ago, she\u2019d said that she was sorry, and that she only wanted Lucy to be happy \u2013 but that was three and a half years ago. A long time in which she might change her mind.\n\nEither way, I would just have to take my own advice, for now. Like I\u2019d said to her, things could be worked out in time.  A wise \u2013 if slightly over-enthusiastic \u2013 old man had told me once that the key to a successful relationship was support. I couldn\u2019t solve the issue for her, and nor could I shelter her away from it. All I could do was hold onto her and hope she would be ready to face it.\n\nEventually, her voice broke me out of my reverie.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got work today, Anon,\u201d She murmured, cracking one eye open to look up at me dolefully. \u201cWe better get up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to take the day off?\u201d I asked. I wasn\u2019t entirely sold on leaving her alone. I wanted to be there if she still needed me. \u201cWe\u2019ve both got sick days. We can just stay home and take it easy, if you like.\u201d\n\nShe looked almost scandalized. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that, Anon. It\u2019s not like school, people are depending on us to be there,\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll live without us for one day. That\u2019s what days off are for.\u201d I reminded her.\n\nFor a moment she considered, then reluctantly acquiesced. \u201cI... I guess so. That would be pretty nice...\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m going to call in then,\u201d I said, leaning in to give her a peck on the cheek before I broke away from her and stood up. \u201cWhere\u2019s your phone? I\u2019ll grab it for you while I\u2019m up.\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ll get up,\u201d I heard some of the life starting to return to her voice as she stood with me. \u201cI want some breakfast anyway. Maybe I\u2019ll just throw some nuggies in the oven...\u201d\n\n \n\nWe spent the day together lazily, sitting on the couch in front of the television and watching whatever was on. It wasn\u2019t exactly my usual idea of entertainment, but it was still the most relaxing day I\u2019d had since my return. The clouds outside darkened the sky, threatening to rain, but inside our apartment it was warm and dry as we cozied up together on the couch.\n\nI noticed Lucy\u2019s interest starting to waver as I got up to make us some sandwiches for lunch. When I came back with plates in hand, she wasn\u2019t even watching the show, just laying down and looking straight ahead.\n\n\u201cHere, Lucy,\u201d I called her attention, proffering hers toward her.\n\nShe snapped herself back to reality  and accepted it with an apologetic smile. \u201cSorry, Anon. I was just trying to think,\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d I asked. \u201cTrish?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m still just... wondering what I would even say to her,\u201d She shrugged morosely. \u201cI used to think she was my best friend... Just me and her against the world, you know? And Reed when he came along. But now, I don\u2019t even know exactly what I was to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way she pushed me around, the way she only cared about the band... The way she yelled at me... Was I ever even really her friend? Or just a tool to her? Just something she could use to make money?\u201d\n\nI found myself thinking back to that day in the principal\u2019s office, after the sabotaged presentation. For everything else I\u2019d managed to forget of that day, I still remembered clearly how distraught Trish had been before I\u2019d left. \u201c... I don\u2019t know for sure, Lucy. But I think she was trying to be your friend. She just didn\u2019t know how.\u201d\n\nLucy was silent for a moment as she considered that. \u201cI just really thought she had it figured out. I thought she had a plan, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah... But she was just a dumb kid, like the rest of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cDumber,\u201d Lucy shook her head. \u201cAnd I trusted her with so much. I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s my fault or hers, do you know what I mean...? I don\u2019t even know if it was wrong of me to do that. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d start talking to her, because I don\u2019t know how much I did wrong...\u201d\n\nShe hauled herself up and started eating as I sat down next to her. Her bites were decidedly larger than mine \u2013 I\u2019d taken precautions against this, however, and made her two sandwiches instead of one.\n\nI was about to speak up when she continued.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, I did do wrong, though. It\u2019s as simple as that. I let myself get taken in. Even if she didn\u2019t mean to control me, I couldn\u2019t even stand up and tell her no. And eventually, I let myself get to the point I didn\u2019t even realize what she was doing anymore.\u201d She gave another slow shake of her head, her gaze falling dispiritedly down to her plate. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to talk to her again, Anon. I don\u2019t know if I want to hear what she might say... because I\u2019m scared I might fall for it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re stronger now, Lucy. Stronger than you think,\u201d I reminded her gently. \u201cI think, even if she really did just want to hurt you, you\u2019d be able to walk away. Look at you. You have your own life now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI...\u201d She heaved a great sigh, looking distractedly ahead at the television. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done that good with my life, Anon. I\u2019ve just gotten by. Barely.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven so, that\u2019s more than a lot of people can manage sometimes. You can be proud of that if nothing else,\u201d Even now I wondered what might have become of me if I hadn\u2019t realized where I was heading that year. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019ve still got a lot more to give in your life, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d She turned a nervous look to me. \u201cWhat makes you think that? I don\u2019t know what you see in me, Anon. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve got anything in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see a lot of things, Lucy. I see how you\u2019ve done your very best \u2013 and done pretty well \u2013 no matter how hard it\u2019s gotten.\u201d I said seriously. \u201cI see someone who cared for me when I still wasn\u2019t even sure if I cared for me. Someone who\u2019s a really rare kind of person, someone who\u2019s worth caring for. Someone who really can make it, who really can go places if she wants to.\u201d\n\nDisquiet only settled deeper and deeper onto her face as I spoke, her lip trembling even as she tried to keep her gaze stoic. Almost on impulse I put my plate aside and shuffled over on the couch to draw her into a tight hug.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so scared, Anon,\u201d She whispered into my ear. \u201cI\u2019m so scared of falling apart again. I\u2019ve already wasted so much of my life. I couldn\u2019t do all that again. Not again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be alright,\u201d I murmured  quietly. \u201cI\u2019m completely sure of that. You\u2019re way tougher than you think.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know that for sure. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m tough enough...\u201d She clung to me desperately, wrapping her wings up around us in a big, feathery cocoon. \u201cI\u2019ve tried so hard to forget about how bad everything went in that last year, but it always keeps coming back no matter how much I want it to go away. I\u2019ve tried to remember those good times I had with Trish, like you said, but the only thing I keep thinking of is lunchtimes, in the auditorium \u2013 and then I always remember when she started yelling...\u201d\n\nI remembered that, too. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Lucy. That shit she said \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was right about one thing.\u201d Lucy\u2019s tiny voice cut through mine. \u201cI am a nobody. I\u2019ve got nobody... Except you. You, and mom and dad, and Naser... But I know I can trust you. You and my family, you\u2019re the only ones who haven\u2019t tried to screw me up. Or... or just done it without even realizing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not nothing, Lucy. You\u2019re not a nobody, and even if you were \u2013\u201d The thought made my stomach churn. I didn\u2019t even want to entertain it. \u201cEven if you were, you can always be more, Lucy. Don\u2019t look at yourself like that. You\u2019re a good person. You always have been.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, Anon. I want to be, but... I just don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d She said glumly.\n\n\u201cI do. I know you can.\u201d I insisted.\n\nShe gave me a small glance before looking away with an almost embarrassed-looking smile. \u201cI\u2019ll try to, Anon. All that stuff you said... I don\u2019t feel like I have any of that in me. But I\u2019ll try.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I love about you. You always try,\u201d\n\nAnd she had, ever since I\u2019d met her. No matter how hard things had been for her, she\u2019d given it her best shot. She hadn\u2019t always succeeded, or walked away unscathed \u2013 Prom night came to mind. But she\u2019d tried hard, and she\u2019d made it this far.\n\nWe turned our attention back to the screen, and slowly the relaxed ambience we\u2019d had before returned to the room. Even so, I couldn\u2019t keep my mind from running about some of the things she\u2019d said as we cuddled up closer on the couch.\n\nI couldn\u2019t remember a whole lot of what I\u2019d heard Trish say to her that day I\u2019d foolishly agreed to Reed\u2019s proposal to meet, but Lucy evidently hadn\u2019t forgotten a word. \u2018I\u2019ve got nobody, but I know I can trust you\u2019. That stuck in my mind. The way she said it so plainly, so matter-of-factly, as though it was something she\u2019d just accepted and now held as truth. Did she really view other people so fearfully now? Had Trish scarred her so badly that she now simply couldn\u2019t believe that anyone who got close might really want to help her?\n\nIt was possible. Maybe even probable. They\u2019d been friends for so many years before I\u2019d met her. Maybe retreating inwards and hiding from the world had been the only way she could cope with the betrayal. Distancing yourself from the pain was a good way to reduce its suffering. I\u2019d ran away just like that before, but it had never actually helped me in the long run, and it clearly hadn\u2019t helped Lucy.\n\nI had to hope that what Trish had done wasn\u2019t truly a betrayal \u2013 that she had just been misguided, not malicious. I didn\u2019t really like her, I\u2019d say that plainly. I\u2019d never really gotten her figured out before I graduated, but I didn\u2019t think she was a bad person.\n\nI really hoped she wasn\u2019t a bad person.\n\nI took my eyes off the show I wasn\u2019t watching to look over at Lucy. She seemed like she was doing alright now, as peaceful as we had been before lunch. She met my gaze.\n\n\u201cI love you, Anon.\u201d She whispered quietly, a gentle shine in her eyes.\n\n\u201cI love you too, Lucy.\u201d\n\nMy phone chose that time to ruin the moment, ringing its chime out abruptly. I cursed it even as I checked the screen to see who was calling. It was a number I didn\u2019t recognize. My brows furrowed as I tried to think \u2013 I wasn\u2019t sure who\u2019d be calling me in lunch hours on a workday, especially when I wasn\u2019t actually there.\n\n\u201cHold that thought, Lucy. I better take this.\u201d I said as I extricated myself from her arms and hauled myself up off the couch.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nI made my way out of the apartment, taking just a moment to appreciate how much colder it was outside before I hit answer.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d A vaguely familiar woman\u2019s voice came from the other end. I couldn\u2019t immediately place who it was; she sounded young, but oddly weathered and bitter, as though she\u2019d been tired so long that had started to outright become her personality.. \u201cUh... This Anon?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered curiously. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u201c... It\u2019s Trish. From high school,\u201d She said hesitantly. I almost dropped the phone in shock. Her voice was near unrecognizable. And how the hell had she gotten my number? \u201c... How\u2019ve you been, skinnie?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2013 You \u2013 Trish?\u201d I couldn\u2019t lie, she had me completely disarmed. \u201cHow did you...\u201d\n\nI had expected it to be difficult to find her, just going off of how obstinate she used to be. Surely she would have made herself impossible to find, that was just the kind of thing she\u2019d do \u2013 Yet here she was, ringing me out of the blue, right after I\u2019d been talking about her no less. Speak of the devil and she will appear, I suppose.\n\nI wasn\u2019t mad about the presentation thing anymore, not really. I\u2019d had a lot worse shit than that happen to me over the years, these days I could just laugh off a couple of dumb cringy pictures. Besides which, I was pretty sure everyone had forgotten about that shit by now \u2013 except Stella anyway. But I could still remember the sheer disdain Trish had for me back then. I\u2019d heard her screaming it out at the top of her lungs that day Reed had held me back in the auditorium.\n\nShe was the one calling me, though, so surely she\u2019d have left it behind by now... Right?\n\n \u201c... get your number? Stella gave me it. She rang me out of the blue, the other day... Said you wanted to talk to me about Fang,\u201d Trish said, then went silent for a moment. \u201cSorry. Lucy, that is. About Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I \u2013\u201d\n\nShe cut over me. \u201cHow\u2019s she going? Is she doing alright?\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure exactly how much I should say. It wasn\u2019t right to talk about Lucy behind her back, especially with someone she might not want to hear it. But at the same time, I could hear a slight note of urgent concern in Trish\u2019s voice, genuine enough that I could believe it.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s... not doing so well lately,\u201d I said guardedly. \u201cThat\u2019s actually the reason I was looking for you. I think you can help her. Do you still want to?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d She answered instantly. \u201cYeah, absolutely. Of course I do. What does she need?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you remember what happened on prom night?\u201d\n\n\u201c... Yeah. I don\u2019t really fucking want to remember prom night, but yeah, I do.\u201d She answered, bitterness returning full force. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nI swallowed before I answered. \u201cLook... She doesn\u2019t say it, but I can tell she regrets how it all went down with you, especially after that night. She misses you Trish, you and Reed, and I think she needs your help. Do you regret \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cCourse I fucking do! What kind of question is that?\u201d She snapped. \u201cI was just trying to help. I said that to you.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2013 then I think she needs to hear you say that.\u201d I explained carefully. \u201cYou remember how I said maybe we could sort all this shit out another day, right...?\u201d\n\nHer response was a long time coming, but a lot less heated when it did. \u201cYeah. Do you want to meet up somewhere, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot today, but yes,\u201d I clarified hastily. I couldn\u2019t just spring this on Lucy like that. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her. Can I call you back on this number?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, just make sure you leave a message if I don\u2019t answer and I\u2019ll hit you back. I got my phone on silent pretty often.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll talk to you soon, Trish.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope so, skinnie, cause I miss her too,\u201d She said. I was about to hang up when she piped up again, sounding much more hesitant. \u201cHey, look, Anon... I, um... I know I never really apologized for that shit I did with the projector that day. I... I shouldn\u2019t have done that, alright? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nIn spite of myself, some part of me had to know. \u201cWhy did you do it, Trish?\u201d\n\n\u201c... Everything just started changing when you came on the scene, you know? I thought you were a bad guy. I thought you deserved it. But... I fucked up.\u201d She said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\n\u201c... Don\u2019t worry about it, Trish. It\u2019s alright.\u201d I thought I\u2019d put it all behind me already, but it still warmed my heart to hear. She wasn\u2019t the bitch I\u2019d been afraid of \u2013 it gave me hope that just maybe this meeting would turn out okay.\n\n\u201cAlright. I just... I just feel bad, is all.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnyway. Hit me back soon. Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoon as I can, Trish. See you.\u201d\n\nI hung up and leaned against the wall for a second as I collected myself. Honestly, it was as though a weight on my shoulder had started to lift. The end of the tunnel  was in sight, and there was light ahead.\n\nI made my way back into the apartment quietly. Lucy looked up as I entered.\n\n\u201cWho was it, Anon?\u201d She asked with a quiet yawn.\n\n \u201cIt was...\u201d Again I hesitated. It was about to be another unpleasant conversation, but I knew better than to try and hide her away from the truth. \u201cWell, you\u2019re probably not going to believe who that was, Lucy. Let me sit down...\u201d\n\n \n\nThe next morning, I was relieved to not wake up alone in bed. I turned my head to find Lucy still next to me, looking up at the roof. She bore a pensive expression, bordering on troubled, but she didn\u2019t seem too stressed by whatever was on her mind. Not that it was hard to guess what that was.\n\nA small smile graced her face as she looked over and found me awake as well. \u201cMorning, Anon.\u201d\n\n\u201cMorning, Lucy.\u201d I mumbled with as much clarity as I could muster at that early point in the day. \u201cSleep alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, actually,\u201d She said with a gentle exhale. \u201cI was just thinking, and I realized you\u2019re definitely right about something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right that I can take it. Whatever she\u2019s got, I can take it. I won\u2019t let myself break down again, like I did before.\u201d She gave a determined, assuring nod, but the nervous exhale she expelled told a more troubling story. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what I want to say, but I do know I want to hear what she says, so you know what? If you call her and tell her I want to meet up, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will?\u201d I asked, taken aback by her sudden drive.\n\n\u201cYeah, I will. That last year... That\u2019s not the Trish I remember at all. I need to know why she changed, what the hell happened with her. I need to know... exactly how much of it all was my fault,\u201d She reached out gave my hand a firm squeeze. \u201cIf she tries to pull anything again, I\u2019ll just walk away \u2013 and that will be the end of it. I\u2019ll let her go.\u201d\n\nThe thought sent a spike of dread down my spine. I knew in my gut that if it came to that, it would not go over well. It would be rough weeks \u2013 or months, or years \u2013 ahead. For all that I loved her, the road she\u2019d gone down these last few years was testament to the fact that she wasn\u2019t very good at letting go like that, and even if she was, it wouldn\u2019t do her good to just let go of her best friend for good.\n\nBut I had to have faith in her. I called Trish as soon as we got up with Lucy\u2019s answer, and to my surprise she actually picked up. She sounded tired and disgruntled at first, but she had trouble keeping her excitement out of her voice as we\u2019d hashed out a plan to meet up that evening at Dino-Moe\u2019s. The same place they\u2019d held their first \u2013 and last \u2013 successful concert.\n\nWork passed in a distracted blur. I wasn\u2019t even really sure what I did that day. I just couldn\u2019t keep my mind off the impending meeting. Worst case scenarios played out in my head over and over, competing for space against the hope that things could and would be okay. In my mind I heard\n\nI shared in Lucy\u2019s nervousness as we drove to Moe\u2019s old pizzeria. I still thought of it as that, even if he no longer owned the place. It felt almost nostalgic as I pulled up out the front, the inviting light of the restaurant brought me back to that happy night as though it hadn\u2019t been nearly three and a half years. It seemed a lot quieter than back then, though \u2013 I could only see a few patrons inside.\n\nLucy kept a tight grip on my hand as we made our way over to the building. As we approached the front window she stopped and held me back for a moment. I glanced back to see her scanning through the window intently.\n\n\u201cThere she is,\u201d She breathed.\n\nI followed her gaze. Trish was sitting alone at a table near the back corner of the restaurant, an untouched appetizer in front of her. She looked to be somewhat on edge, her gaze intense but focused on nothing in particular as she drummed her fingers on the table. She didn\u2019t quite look as tired as she\u2019d sounded on the phone, but she definitely didn\u2019t give the impression of the energetic, hair-trigger girl I remembered anymore. She was a little taller than I remember her, but only a little. She\u2019d ditched the ever-present yellow hoodie in favour of a navy blue jacket, but she still had the same old dreadlocks.\n\nMy immediate impression was that she\u2019d changed \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t sure how much.\n\nLucy seemed transfixed for a moment, her gaze inscrutable as she stared silently at her old friend through the window. Finally, though, with a deep breath and a heavy exhale, she pulled her eyes away. A resolute look was set on her face as she motioned towards the door.\n\n\u201cCome on, Anon. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThe bell chimed out as we pushed open the door, immediately prompting Trish to look up and see us. For a split second her eyes lit up as she saw Lucy, but the very next moment the expression of consternation returned.\n\n\u201cHey! Hey, Lucy! Anon! It\u2019s been so long!\u201d She looked as though she wanted to jump up and meet us halfway, but had to restrain herself. \u201cHow have you guys been going?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, Trish. Doing alright, I suppose.\u201d I said non-committally. \u201cHow about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot too bad! Been real busy the last few weeks,\u201d She replied with a visibly forced smile. \u201cHow about you, Lucy?\u201d\n\nLucy held her silence for a second before she answered. \u201c... I\u2019m alright, Trish. It\u2019s... It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s great to see you guys doing alright!\u201d Trish beamed. \u201cWhat have you both been up to all this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cI joined the army not long after school. I\u2019ve been deployed overseas the last few years,\u201d I stepped up to answer when Lucy seemed to hesitate.\n\nFor a moment the surprise on Trish\u2019s face was actually genuine. \u201cWow, really? Huh, I wouldn\u2019t have seen that coming. No wonder you got so jacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cArmy life tends to do that,\u201d I remarked with a half shrug.\n\n\u201cNo joke,\u201d She said. \u201c... What was it like? Was it bad?\u201d\n\n\u201cI made it back in one piece. Let\u2019s just leave it at that,\u201d I shook my head. Even if I\u2019d actually wanted to remember all that, this wasn\u2019t the time.\n\nTrish took the hint. \u201cDamn. Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re alright at least, skinnie.\u201d\n\nShe turned her eyes to Lucy then, with an inviting smile and a curious little tilt of her head. Lucy answered with a small smile of her own as she proffered her hand toward her. Trish\u2019s eyes scanned back and forth across it a few times, uncomprehending until I stretched my own hand out as well. As she took in the two wedding rings on our fingers, her eyes just about popped out of her head.\n\n\u201cOh! Oh, damn! You guys... You guys got married!?\u201d Trish gasped. \u201cShit \u2013 I mean, damn! Congratulations! Anon, you didn\u2019t even mention that on the phone!\u201d\n\n\u201cWanted it to be a surprise,\u201d I smiled and reached out to clasp Lucy\u2019s hand in mine. Inwardly I was glad Trish hadn\u2019t reacted adversely to the news. \u201cWe tied the knot a few months after I got back.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn. Congratulations...\u201d She said again. She bore a smile of her own, but even as I watched it was quickly falling apart. As she looked at our rings, her face fell steadily into dismay, then into outright misery, as though her whole world had just fell apart in front of her. \u201cI, ah, I... I... I gotta say...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I asked, suddenly concerned for where this was going.\n\n\u201cI... I just want to say...\u201d She gulped and looked down at the table, abruptly bringing one hand up to prop her head up. The veneer of happy, casual confidence she\u2019d borne thus far had disappeared completely, and all of a sudden she just looked like a miserable wreck. \u201cI just... I\u2019m so sorry, Lucy!\u201d\n\nLucy was visibly caught off guard. She opened her mouth to say something, but Trish kept going with a quick breath.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I should have been there, I should have been there at your wedding for you, but I wasn\u2019t and it\u2019s all because I was a fucking terrible friend,\u201d She choked up, audibly keeping herself from sobbing. \u201cI wasn\u2019t at your wedding and I can\u2019t even fucking blame you. Lucy, I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d\n\n\u201cTrish, I...\u201d Lucy\u2019s voice was conflicted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for how I treated you, for all that stupid shit I did. You were my only real friend back then, Fang, I was so scared of losing you!\u201d Trish cried out. Lucy cringed slightly at the mention of her old name, but she didn\u2019t speak up. \u201cAnd \u2013 And I didn\u2019t want Naser or Anon to help you, cause I thought I could do it. I thought if you had them, you wouldn\u2019t need me anymore! Nobody else ever liked me like you did back when we were kids! You were my only friend, and I wanted to help you, but if you didn\u2019t need my help...\u201d\n\nShe had her head buried in her hands now, unable to so much as look at either one of us, quaking as repressed emotion escaped her. It occurred to me then that Lucy hadn\u2019t been  the only one suffering from old wounds those three years, that she hadn\u2019t been the only one whose life had been terribly changed that semester.\n\n\u201c... then I\u2019d be useless.\u201d Trish\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cI just wanted to help you. I didn\u2019t want to lose you... I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d\n\n\u201cTrish, I have to ask,\u201d Lucy spoke softly, but surprisingly firmly. Trish looked up with watery eyes at the sound of her voice. \u201cThat stuff with my family and Anon. With Naser. Why... Why\u2019d you do all that? The way you treated them, the way you got me to treat them... that was so cruel.\u201d\n\nAgain her face fell into her hands. \u201cI know, but... every time I thought about it back then... Every time, I just remembered that time when you told me... when you told me you hated yourself. And that\u2019s all I could ever remember! I thought it was all worth it if you had a new you that you could love, and... I thought everyone else would just pull you back to the old you, the you you hated. I only wanted to help you, but I didn\u2019t realize... I just didn\u2019t want to think... that you might not need me anymore. So I aimed bigger, I came up with big plans. I just thought we\u2019d be famous, we\u2019d be famous together, and I could show you how great you really truly are...\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for her. The worst part was that from a warped perspective, all of it made sense. I could see exactly how she\u2019d gone wrong. All the horrible things she\u2019d said and the devious shit she\u2019d pulled \u2013 she\u2019d gotten caught up in her own schemes, trapped in a hooked net she hadn\u2019t even realized she\u2019d been making, the wounds from which still bled both of them today. She hadn\u2019t even realized how badly she was hurting Lucy, or herself.\n\nShe\u2019d tried her best with what she had back then, but after all was said and done, she\u2019d been nothing but a dumb kid.\n\n \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve thought of it, I\u2019ve thought of how fucked up I was. I was so desperate for you to need me, that I thought it would be okay if you didn\u2019t need anybody else. I thought I could make it all work. I thought I could turn your life around all on my own. I... I thought I had to, \u2018cause nobody else could,\u201d Tears of open regret flowed freely down Trish\u2019s face now as she made her confession. \u201cBut I was wrong. I was wrong about everything. I was so stupid, and controlling, and I made you hate me \u2018cause I was a fucking idiot, but Fang, I didn\u2019t mean to. I know I don\u2019t deserve to be your friend anymore, but I just had to tell you... I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to fuck it all up like I did. I just wanted to help you.\u201d\n\nI could see Lucy\u2019s eyes glistening as her gaze fell to the table. Hell, I had to admit I could feel the waterworks starting unbidden in my own eyes. Again I had to wonder if this was a discussion that should have happened a long, long time ago.\n\n\u201cTrish...\u201d Lucy murmured in a nervous, tremulous voice. \u201cTrish, all this time I wasn\u2019t even sure if you were ever my friend. I thought you were trying to trick me into something, but I couldn\u2019t ever figure out why you would do that. You really... never hated me...?\n\n\u201cNo! Never!\u201d Trish shook her head emphatically, a stray tear flitting off her face. \u201cI just thought if I planned a little better, if I was a little smarter, it would all pay off. We\u2019d all work hard, and we\u2019d be famous, and everyone would love us, and we\u2019d all be happy. But everything started falling apart, and I just thought I had to work even harder because I was too scared and stupid to fucking think! I never meant \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cTrish \u2013 It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nLucy surprised us both with those three words, and for a moment silence reigned at the table. She had a look on her face that I\u2019d only ever seen once before, in all my time with her, on the roof of Volcano High. A look of quiet, grateful revelation. A look that might well have opened up the world before her, like she\u2019d suddenly found the answer to a question that had haunted her forever.\n\nShe looked up and met Trish\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Trish.\u201d Lucy repeated gently, the words escaping her almost like a sigh of relief. \u201cI should have realized you weren\u2019t really like that. We were friends so long, and I still thought you just changed instead of trying to talk to you...\u201d\n\n\u201cWha \u2013 Don\u2019t apologize, you idiot! Why are you apologizing, when I\u2019m the one who nearly fucked your life up?\u201d\n\nThe both of them stood up almost simultaneously,making their ways around the table in step. Lucy put her hands on Trish\u2019s short little shoulders, looking down with a careful, examining gaze \u2013 and then, I\u2019ll swear the very next moment they were embracing, sobbing into each other\u2019s arms, Trish blubbering wildly and Lucy faring little better.\n\n\u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry I yelled at you, I\u2019m sorry I said all that shit, I\u2019m sorry I ruined the band, I\u2019m sorry for prom night \u2013\u201d\n\n Lucy said nothing, only held onto her oldest friend, the pair of them swaying together as their outpouring overcame them. I could swear I felt my heart lightening as I looked on, sheer relief overtaking me as I practically saw the years of turmoil falling away from both of them. It wasn\u2019t as bad as I\u2019d feared after all. Maybe it never had been. Maybe it didn\u2019t need to have gone on like this for as long as it had. Maybe this painful path hadn\u2019t needed to be walked for this long.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t matter anymore. It was going to be alright.\n\nLucy caught my eye and waved me in towards them with one hand. Her voice quavered as she tried to laugh. \u201cCome on, Anon. You come here too. Group hug. It\u2019s about time you two kissed and made up.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod. Anon, I really am sorry,\u201d Trish turned to me with a rueful look. \u201cThose stupid pictures, that stuff I said about you... I shouldn\u2019t have. I\u2019m sorry. I fucked up. I had you figured out wrong. I had everything figured out wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Trish. Don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d I waved her off with a little smile. I joined their little circle against the world with an arm linked around them both, following Trish\u2019s lead in leaning on Lucy\u2019s shoulder. I didn\u2019t care who in the restaurant might be looking at that point. \u201cEveryone\u2019s forgotten about it by now anyway. Except Stella... She remembers,\u201d\n\nTrish gave a choked-up laugh. \u201cOf course she would. That weirdo, with her animes and stuff...\u201d\n\n\u201cI... I think I had you figured out wrong too. I used to think you just hated me, that you were just... I don\u2019t know. A bad person.\u201d I said somberly. \u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was. I really was, back then.\u201d She mourned. \u201cNeither of you deserved all that shit I gave you. I got so caught up in my own bullshit, I forgot what being a friend is actually meant to be about. I fucked up so bad, you guys...\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Trish. Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s all in the past now, right?\u201d\n\nShe looked up, her gaze flicking between Lucy and I, before a small smile finally spread across her face. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Lucy chimed in, a genuine smile on her tear-stained face.\n\nWe split back apart again, Trish looking up at us both with a hopeful expression.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starved. You guys \u2013 You guys want to get something to eat? Since we\u2019re here? We can catch up a bit. I\u2019ll shout,\u201d\n\nEven holding back tears, she sounded so much more like the Trish I remembered.\n\nLucy spoke for us both as we nodded in unison. \u201cSure, Trish. Do you know if they still do the Meateor Special here?\u201d\n\n \n\nWe made our way back into our apartment in better cheer than I remember being in a long time. Lucy finally seemed utterly relaxed, that beautiful serene expression I\u2019d only seen on her face while she was asleep now finally gracing her waking hours. She leaned against me as made our way up the stairs, but not for support \u2013 solely for proximity. She moved now as though a weight had been taken off her shoulders, at peace with the world at last.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we went, Anon,\u201d She murmured, flicking the light on as we crossed the threshold to our little home. \u201cI\u2019m glad you talked me into it. In hindsight, it feels so stupid... I can\u2019t believe I would have run away from Trish forever over that. I got myself so worked up, but... she was just scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople do all kinds of things when they\u2019re scared,\u201d I said in concurrence.\n\n\u201cThat they do.\u201d She agreed quietly. \u201cI... I\u2019ve been scared all this time. I didn\u2019t want to see her, because I thought she\u2019d just hurt me again. But... I shouldn\u2019t have been. I should have known better than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up, Lucy,\u201d I reassured her. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. We made it here alright. That\u2019s what counts the most.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d She said with a rueful laugh. \u201cJust... makes me feel dumb, is all. Me and her, we were both scared of nothing in the end, and it nearly fucked us both up big time.\u201d\n\nLucy split away from me, heading over to the closet where we kept the few things we hadn\u2019t unpacked yet. I followed in her footsteps as she pulled it open, and carefully extracted...\n\n... her old guitar. The instrument that she once hadn\u2019t been able to give any excuse not to bring, now held happily again in her capable hands.\n\n\u201cLucy...\u201d I whispered, struck by what it meant.\n\n\u201cI wonder if she\u2019d ever want to play again. Like old times...\u201d Her whisper was just barely audible, but the gleam in her eye was plain to see as she turned back around to face me. \u201cAnon, you remember our song, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t ever forget, Lucy.\u201d That song had been pretty much the only thing keeping me going at some points.\n\n\u201cI want to play it,\u201d She said breathlessly, looking up at me with an exhilarated smile. \u201cJust... bear with me for a bit, alright? I gotta try and get back in gear first.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I laughed.\n\nLucy plucked away at the strings as we relocated to the bedroom and sat down together on our bed. Just as she had with the church organ, she spent a few minutes at practice, strumming through melodies as she reacquainted herself with the strings she\u2019d used to hold dear. I tried to follow her motions with my eyes \u2013 she\u2019d taught me a lot about playing guitar, but even out of practice as she called herself, I wasn\u2019t anywhere near her level.\n\nFinally she seemed satisfied, letting her last note hang for a moment before giving a light chuckle. \u201cAlright. Let\u2019s just see how I go, here.\u201d\n\nShe began slowly, gently, quietly strumming the song into the air with a never-forgotten artist\u2019s ease. In an instant I was taken away, and the rest of the world ceased to exist. The steady, peaceful motions of her hands and the intent focus in her eyes were the most beautiful contrast I\u2019d ever seen in the world as she brought back times I\u2019d thought I might only ever visit again in my memories. It was like those three years apart hadn\u2019t passed. It was like we were still there, in her room, sitting together as we composed this song. At this very moment it was the pinnacle of everything we shared together. She poured her soul into it as she moved from bar to well-remembered bar, her careful motions allowing the music to fill the room with its quiet, reflective tone.\n\nEverything we\u2019d gone through together was in that song. If she\u2019d looked up she might have seen my very soul bare on display, just as much as hers was \u2013 but the music was her entire world in that moment, exactly as it was mine.\n\nShe\u2019d suffered in her silence. In her fear she\u2019d muted herself, deprived herself of an undeniable part of her \u2013 but now, this melancholy rendition of our song was offered up as a testament to who she truly was, no matter the years lost.\n\nShe\u2019d changed. She\u2019d endured. She\u2019d grown.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crying, Anon.\u201d Her voice pulled me out of my reverie.\n\nI looked up away from the guitar at last.I hadn\u2019t even noticed she\u2019d stopped playing \u2013 the melody still echoed in my head, pulling me away back to simpler times. Her own eyes were glistening wet, a shaky smile on her face.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just raining,\u201d I sniffed. \u201cHeh. Hey, Fang. How\u2019ve you been?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t call me that, Anon,\u201d She gave a hiccuping laugh, before shaking her head quickly. \u201cGod, you don\u2019t want me to be Fang again, do you? I was so... so edgy back then,\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you...\u201d I grasped her by the shoulders, looking firmly into her glistening amber eyes, \u201c... to be happy with exactly who you are, and what you do. I don\u2019t want you to leave any part of you behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just... I was so stupid back then...\u201d She sniffed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I let things get like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, Lucy. We were all stupid. I still loved you then. I still love you now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all of us. You weren\u2019t.\u201d She said with a little smile.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I was any smarter than you. Just... I dunno. Really lucky, I guess,\u201d I murmured and pulled her into a hug. The guitar was set aside as she wrapped her wings tightly around me. I always felt like the world was a million miles away when she did this. \u201cWell, I must have been. I met you, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be so goddamn cheesy,\u201d She said with another short laugh before she breathed out, audibly struggling to keep from choking up. \u201cIt\u2019s just so stupid... I never felt like it was mine, this guitar. Ever since that day, it was Trish\u2019s. I just thought... it was what she wanted out of me. All she wanted out of me, you know? The music. But I didn\u2019t want to give it to her anymore. That\u2019s why I wanted to put it away.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she was just as dumb as us. Didn\u2019t know how to say what she really wanted,\u201d I whispered. I felt Lucy\u2019s heart beating as we embraced, strong and sure in spite of this precious, fleeting state of being.\n\n\u201cAnd neither did I,\u201d Lucy shook her head and sobbed. \u201cI\u2019ve been so stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lucy. We\u2019ll be alright now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah... You\u2019re right. We will,\u201d She said, a firmness in her voice even as it wavered. \u201cI\u2019m going to do better from now on, Anon. No more falling apart like I did after school. No more being afraid. I want to be the best person I can, and I want to make you happy like you\u2019ve made me happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already do that every day, Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop being so sappy, god damn,\u201d She shoved me with a weak laugh. \u201cI\u2019m trying to have a moment here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Lucy, alright then \u2013\u201d I struggled for a moment to think of something. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll help you be the best person you can, in any way I can. I promise I\u2019ll make you exactly as happy as you want to make me. How\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect. Thank you,\u201d She whispered. \u201cFor everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Lucy,\u201d I pulled back for a moment to look at the woman who\u2019d pulled me out of my shell at last. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThought I said to stop being sappy.\u201d She said with a snort of laughter.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re one to talk, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I pointed out, unable to keep a smile from creeping across my own face as well.\n\nShe considered for a moment before laughing again. \u201cYeah. I guess I am.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t bother to get back up, to get changed out of our clothes, or even to put the guitar back. We fell back onto the bed and we fell asleep that night exactly where we were, exactly as we were, cuddled up together on top of the blankets.\n\nThe ceiling light was still on, but it wasn\u2019t a bother to us. We didn\u2019t even notice. The light Lucy and I shared between us was bright enough to match it.\n\nWe had each other.\n\n\n\nThe sound of gentle strumming and the smell of cooking food hit me as I opened the door, immediately setting me at ease as I stepped into the apartment. Every other day since we met Trish a week or so ago, I\u2019d come home to the pleasant sound of Lucy playing her guitar. One time I\u2019d managed to sneak in quietly enough that she hadn\u2019t even noticed, wrapped up in her jam session as she was. I\u2019d sat there and listened for a good few minutes until she\u2019d finally looked up and noticed me.\n\nThis time however she heard me enter, immediately breaking off from her song and giving me a warm smile.\n\n\u201cHey, Anon! There you are!\u201d Lucy stretched and ruffled her wings as she stood up off the couch, still holding her guitar in one hand. \u201cLate again, I see. Gonna have to dock your pay if you keep this up,\u201d\n\nWe shared a quick peck on the cheek. \u201cHey. Sorry, Lucy. It\u2019s this event still... You wouldn\u2019t believe how much paperwork there is just to get a spot at a college expo organized.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot sure I\u2019d want to, either,\u201d She said with a good-humoured snicker as she put her guitar away on its metal stand. She\u2019d gone out and bought it a few days ago, just so she could have her instrument on display in the living room. \u201cI was just getting in some practice while I waited for dinner to finish cooking... It should be just about ready by now, I think. I thought we\u2019d have a nice little potato bake tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds good to me. Your cooking\u2019s always the best, Lucy.\u201d It wasn\u2019t even an exaggeration, I was practically spoiled with her around. I hung my keys up and followed her as she sauntered off into the kitchen, eagerly anticipating whatever she\u2019d made.\n\nShe picked up her phone and briefly checked something on it. \u201cOh. Nope, timer says five more minutes, actually. Sorry.\u201d\n\nDamn. I had to admit, the smell alone was quickly making me hungry. \u201cOh, well. How was your day?\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty good, actually! Trish called earlier, while I was cooking.\u201d\n\nThat caught my interest. Trish and Lucy seemed to be slowly rekindling their friendship, keeping in touch online and over the phone. I didn\u2019t know exactly what they talked about \u2013 catching up on old times and girl stuff, presumably. It wasn\u2019t any of my business, and I wasn\u2019t too worried. I doubted Trish would do anything to jeopardize the relationship she\u2019d just recently salvaged, but even so, I hoped she wouldn\u2019t go on to try and rekindle their friendship in exactly the same way they\u2019d had it before. Lucy just didn\u2019t need that kind of help anymore.\n\nI knew she was stronger now than she had been back then, just like I\u2019d said to her. I didn\u2019t think Trish would act like someone who needed handling \u2013 I really hoped she wouldn\u2019t \u2013 but if she did, Lucy could handle it. I had faith in her.\n\n\u201cYeah? What\u2019d she call about?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s been talking to Reed. Apparently they kept in touch,\u201d She explained as she started setting the table. \u201cHe\u2019s moved out of Volcaldera for his work. She says it\u2019s something pharmaceutical, she\u2019s not exactly sure what... But either way, she got him to agree to come visit at some point. What do you reckon?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be... interesting. Pharmaceutical, huh?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what to make of that. Given the stuff Reed had been into when I\u2019d known him, \u2018pharmaceutical\u2019 could mean anything under the sun. I remember him being pretty cool though, if maybe a bit too laid back. \u201cIt\u2019d be good to catch up with him, I suppose. See what he\u2019s been up to and all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah... Also, Trish is coming over for dinner.\u201d Lucy said abruptly, turning to me with a cheeky smile.\n\n\u201cOh, sounds good. When?\u201d I was a little taken aback. I hadn\u2019t expected  either of them to reconnect quite this fast, honestly.\n\nAgain she picked her phone up and checked the time. \u201cWell, she said she\u2019d be here about twenty minutes ago, so probably soon, I\u2019d hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait \u2013 She\u2019s coming tonight?\u201d\n\nI found myself somewhere between shocked and impressed. It was great that Lucy was beginning to let people back into her life, instead of only having her work and... me. Just a few short weeks ago I was worried that she\u2019d never open up again \u2013 it really felt like she had left a piece of her soul behind, that year at Volcano High. But now, she was already reaching out, making plans to meet up with friends of her own volition. Her old friend, with all the baggage they\u2019d shared, no less. She was moving past it at a phenomenal rate.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Her smile fell slightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind, right...?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not a bit, Lucy,\u201d I reassured her hastily. \u201cJust a bit surprised, is all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah... Sorry, I probably should have said something beforehand,\u201d She said sheepishly.\n\nI was about to reiterate that it was fine when Lucy\u2019s phone buzzed loudly. As she checked it, I heard an abrupt knocking at the door, but before I could so much as move a muscle she\u2019d dropped her phone down on the table and dashed past me excitedly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s her now, she just messaged me!\u201d She said exuberantly as I followed along in her wake.\n\n\u201cShe messaged you she\u2019s at the door, then knocked anyway?\u201d I asked confusedly.\n\nLucy turned and shrugged as she unlocked the door. Trish was in fact just behind it, dressed in a sharp but modest skirt and jacket. She tucked her phone back into her pocket as she greeted us with a tired smile.\n\n\u201cHey, Lucy! Sorry I\u2019m late, work was a bitch and so was traffic. Didn\u2019t even bother going home to get changed, just thought I should probably come right over,\u201d She said apologetically.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not the only one. Anon was late too,\u201d Lucy gave a smile of her own as she stood aside to let Trish in. \u201cIt\u2019s good timing, anyway, actually! Dinner will be done in a few minutes if you just hang tight.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool, I\u2019m starving like you wouldn\u2019t believe. Haven\u2019t eaten since breakfast,\u201d Trish remarked with a faux carefree air as she stepped into our little home. Her eyes fell on me as she made herself look busy inspecting the place, and she gave me a polite nod. \u201cHey, Anon. How you going?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, thanks, Trish. We\u2019ve been doing alright,\u201d I stepped aside to let Lucy past, brushing her wing with one arm as she made her way back to the kitchen and left us two to make our own conversation. \u201cA lot better lately, especially. How are you? You look like you\u2019re being run ragged.\u201d\n\n\u201cBusy as hell. Trying to expand the salon, but it\u2019s hell juggling keeping the place going and running around to offices all over town.\u201d She shook her head then gave a resigned shrug. \u201cAh, well. Work giving you hassles too, huh? ... Remind me what do you do again, sorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cRecruitment, now. Technically it\u2019s still duty, but it doesn\u2019t much feel like it,\u201d I said casually. \u201cJust been having issues getting some stuff sorted out with an event in a few weeks. Paperwork and stuff, you know,\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. I know what you mean, paperwork\u2019s been my nightmare lately,\u201d She said with a knowledgeable nod. \u201cLike, things have been going great at work, but I want to go bigger. There\u2019s a serious gap in the market around here for horn cosmetics, you know? But now I\u2019m almost thinking it\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth. All the licenses and stuff you need, it\u2019s insane...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need a loicense to paint horns now as well?\u201d Inwardly I laughed, thinking of an old joke I\u2019d shared with Lucy.\n\nTrish gave me a confused look for a moment but didn\u2019t bother to ask. \u201cNot just painting, Anon. Extensions, reshaping, hollowing, that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, what? Hollowing? Isn\u2019t that dangerous?\u201d I asked uncertainly. \u201cIt sure sounds dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the slightest! No more dangerous than nail cosmetics, and people do all kinds of crazy shit with those,\u201d Trish said insistently as she shook her head. I got the feeling she\u2019d had this conversation a bunch of times with other people already. \u201cIn some ways a horn is just a really big nail, anyway. There\u2019s a ton of room to do some creative shit with them, I swear, but most people won\u2019t even think of trying it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it sounds like you\u2019re going to have a hell of a job convincing people. From my layman's perspective, first thing I think of when I hear that is that it sounds like surgery.\u201d The sounds of dinner being plated drew me into the kitchen, with Trish following along right behind me as we talked.\n\n\u201cYou can see the other half of the issue I\u2019m having, then. No idea whatsoever about how I\u2019m gonna advertise this stuff...\u201d She groused. \u201cStill, I know I\u2019m onto something. Just have to hash it out a bit more.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I hope you can figure something out.\u201d I said sympathetically.\n\n\u201cThanks, Anon,\u201d She smiled. Her face practically lit up as she entered the kitchen. \u201cHoly shit, Lucy, this smells great! What is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a potato bake. Keeping it simple tonight,\u201d She answered, a slightly flustered flush visible from the praise.\n\n\u201cGod damn. I think I\u2019m gonna have to come around here more often,\u201d Trish marvelled, her eyes fixed covetously on the pan of fresh-baked goodness Lucy was serving up. \u201cI usually just have microwave dinners, if anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeesh, Trish, don\u2019t do that to yourself,\u201d Lucy chided. \u201cThat stuff\u2019s awful for you. It\u2019s not too hard to cook something quick up yourself, you know.\u201d\n\nThe three of us took a seat as Lucy finished dishing up with a flourish. Trish immediately picked up her knife and fork and made to dig in, but Lucy waylaid her with a slap on the hand and a sharp look.\n\n\u201cHey! We say grace before we eat in this house. Or apartment as it might be.\u201d\n\nA look of pure, devastated disappointment fell onto Trish\u2019s face as she was forced to restrain herself a moment longer. \u201cOh. Sorry. Uh... I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSomehow I managed to constrain myself to a clandestine smile. Mollified, Lucy withdrew her arm and clasped her fingers together, closing her eyes in simple reverence.\n\n\u201cDear Lord, we give thanks to you this evening for the meal we are about to eat. Amen.\u201d She picked up her knife and fork and looked over to Trish, who was still looking between us uncertainly. \u201c... You can eat now, Trish.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh thank God, for a second there I was worried you had to like, recite a whole prayer or something,\u201d As soon as she heard the word, Trish started attacking her food with gusto.\n\nI bemusedly watched her go as I picked up my own cutlery. \u201cYou sure they\u2019re not starving you, Trish?\u201d\n\n\u201cDude, like I said. I haven\u2019t had anything to eat except breakfast today,\u201d She said between mouthfuls. \u201cHad to skip lunch... This is really good, Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Trish. It really sounds like you should take some more time for yourself, though... Skipping meals and microwave dinners, that can\u2019t be healthy,\u201d Lucy said with a tone of concern.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not gonna be like this forever. I just got a fair bit going on with work,\u201d She shrugged indifferently. \u201cI don\u2019t really know anything about cooking anyway, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could teach you, if you want,\u201d Lucy offered, leaning in earnestly. \u201cWe could hang out some day and I\u2019d show you a bit. It\u2019s not too hard.\u201d\n\nTrish actually paused in her rapacious eating to consider it. I could only imagine she was wondering at the depths of how much her friend had changed over the years, because now I thought about it myself, it had to be somewhat of a shock to her. From the edgy punk rocker person she\u2019d been molded into, to the woman she was now.\n\nShe looked up to meet Lucy\u2019s eager eyes, and after a moment, a genuine smile spread across her face. \u201cYeah, sure. That\u2019d be cool.\u201d\n\nThe conversation brought up a memory to my mind. \u201cOh, that reminds me, Lucy. You remember Stella? I was talking to her the other week, she said that she and Rosa would be down to meet up for lunch or something at some point, if you wanted to catch up. What do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, might be fun. I haven\u2019t talked to either of them for a long while...\u201d She nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI wonder how they\u2019re doing these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, I got a thought,\u201d Trish piped up, pulling herself away from her already mostly cleared-out plate. \u201cIf we could get Reed in town for it, maybe we could all go out together and make it a big do. Like a little mini class reunion or something. Go out and grab some dinner somewhere, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d I nodded. It would be good to be able to catch up with everyone at the same time. \u201cWe\u2019d just have to organize a date that works for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll have to talk to Reed, I don\u2019t even really know when he\u2019s free. Also, can I grab seconds? This is really, really good.\u201d\n\nLucy gave a snort of laughter. \u201cHelp yourself, Trish. Just don\u2019t eat it all, alright?\u201d\n\nThe rest of the meal passed with amicable conversation as Trish finally slowed down enough to speak like a normal human being \u2013 or dino, as it were. The three of us talked about work, swapped stories and shot the shit like the three years of angst behind us simply hadn\u2019t happened at all. We even managed to while away another hour or two afterward chatting. Lucy laughed and smiled freely the whole while, as unreservedly happy as I\u2019d ever seen her.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that she had her friend back, so much as that she seemed to have her self back. She was still in the process of shedding the years of bitterness, but at least she was finally able to. It might be a long road yet that she had to walk, but already she\u2019d proven that she was capable of more than she thought, and that she had people beyond her immediate family who were willing to help her. She\u2019d shown herself that she didn\u2019t need to be afraid of herself, of people, of the world.  I believed that knowing that \u2013 knowing it with the certainty of truth and taking it in as a part of her, not merely being told by someone else \u2013 made a world of difference.\n\nWhen the time came that Trish finally decided to call it a night and head home, Lucy sent her off with a hug. Trish returned it nervously at first, but soon looked like she didn\u2019t want to let go, closing her eyes tightly as she held onto her.\n\n\u201cWe should do this again soon, alright Trish? I\u2019ve really missed seeing you.\u201d Lucy said softly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too, Lucy...\u201d Trish replied, her voice doleful. \u201cI really am sorry. I wish I\u2019d never \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Trish. Please.\u201d Lucy insisted as they separated again. \u201cI\u2019m doing alright now. We\u2019re all doing alright now. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah... You\u2019re right.\u201d She gave a hesitant smile. \u201cSee you later, Lucy. Bye, Anon. It was nice seeing you guys again.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame to you, Trish. See you.\u201d\n\nAs Lucy and I saw Trish off, content with an evening of good food and good company, I realized all of a sudden just how much less bleak everything had really felt lately. Looking back, my memories since my return almost felt pale to me \u2013 hopeful, but not really happy. Now, I found myself actually looking forward to tomorrow for how it would be as we had it, not for how it might be better in future.\n\nI didn\u2019t fear for Lucy anymore. I didn\u2019t need to, and she didn\u2019t need me to. It had been a dark few years, but from where we stood now, it all looked a lot brighter.","encoded":false,"Title":"Ending 3 - Light Inside","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Stella and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Cobalt_Blue_Sphere","Summary":"She knew she was supposed to do better.

Lucy walked with her hands comedically outstretched in front of her, acting like she would find a new obstacle with every step. We were walking through the city park where we had reunited six months ago, soft twilight enveloping everything in a dim light interrupted only by the park\u2019s lamps as the twinkled on, one by one. With my face this close to Lucy, I can smell her hair, the delicate mix of coconut and orange blossoms filling my nose. In the time since I returned to Volcaldera, I had tried to fill my entire life with her, working hard to absorb as much of her as I could. Hardly a day had gone by when we didn\u2019t see each other, but picking up our relationship after such a long time away hadn\u2019t been easy: Lucy had changed, more than just what she had admitted to me that first night we were together. She seemed tense, as though she was still protecting herself from something, a feeling that I suspected only got worse when I was gone. I often caught her staring off into space when she didn\u2019t think I could see, a morose expression on her face. Seeing her in those moments would break my heart just a little bit, but ultimately only served to deepen my instinct to protect her. Tonight, however, she was all smiles, her beauty on full display even as I picked her up from her parents house. Ripley and Sam had become like another set of parents to me as well, and had done wonders to support us through the early stumbles of our relationship. Sam was especially overjoyed to hear Lucy and I had started dating again, and it seemed my time spent in the deserts during the war had done wonders to improve Ripley\u2019s opinion of me. The expression on his face when I had informed him of my plans for tonight as we waited for Lucy to get ready for our date had be priceless.  \n\n\u201cAnon, geez, can\u2019t you just tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d Lucy asks, laughing as her heel catches momentarily on something unseen on the concrete path. I had made her close her eyes a few blocks away from the park, but I could do little to hide the cool night air or the smell of the water from her. Both of us are wearing our best formal wear, Lucy resplendent in an amber-colored halter dress, a cream-colored wrap draped over her arms, a string of pearls from her mother around her neck. I had donned my old dress uniform, slightly surprised that it still fit after these months of Sam\u2019s filling Sunday church lunches. Neither the sort of thing one would usually wear when trekking across a public park late at night, but I had promised Lucy something special tonight, and I intended to make good on that promise.\n\n\u201cHey now, I said no hints! It\u2019ll spoil the surprise\u2026\u201d I whisper in her ear, feeling her body tremble slightly as I do so. I slow Lucy to a stop, careful not to press into her wings too harshly, keeping my body well back from her. My heart was beating out of my chest, now that we were so close to our destination, and I didn\u2019t want the soft pitter-patter of my heart against her wings to give away the surprise. We weren\u2019t far from the bench where we reunited, the spot I had picked out for our date this evening. In truth, that spot that would always hold a special place in my heart, and we had re-visited that park bench so many times over our relationship I was worried Lucy would recognize where we were going by feel alone. Giggling as I accidently bumped her into a trash can, Lucy moved her hands to mine, half-heartedly attempting to pull them away.\n\u201cPleeeeese? Just a little peak? I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t spoil anything\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no peeking babe!\u201d The nervousness gives my voice a slight edge as I hold my hands firmly against her eyes. Lucy immediately drops her hands, and I can feel her body tense up slightly. It\u2019s the same reaction whenever I raise my voice even a little around her, or put my foot down on an issue. But Lucy always yields, and I quickly reassure her everything is ok, hoping to dispel any unwarranted tension. \u201cPlease Lucy, just a few more steps, then you can open your eyes, okay?\u201d \n\n\u201cOkay Anon, I trust you,\u201d Lucy responds, as meek as milk. Kissing her on the top of her head, I guide her the rest of the short distance towards the bench, removing my hands from her eyes at last.   \n\n\u201cOkay, open your eyes\u2026\u201d I whisper, my hands now resting on her shoulders. Slowly, Lucy blinks her eyes open, those amber orbs drinking in the bench before her, drinking in what I had planned hours before hand. Draped across the seat of the bench is a white cloth, dozens of red camellia petals strewn over the surface. Thirty-six small candles also dotted the bench, resting on small plates and dishes I had carefully collected from Lucy\u2019s mom. Sitting in the middle of all of this was a small box, suitable only for a small piece of jewelry or other keepsake. In this case, a ring.\nGrinning, I watch Lucy\u2019s face over her shoulder, a wondering realization filled her face. Tears filled her eyes as she covered her snoot with her hands, a beaming smile already splitting her mouth. Choking back a sob, Lucy turned her face to look at me, pulling her hands away from her mouth with a shudder.\n\u201cOh, Anon, it\u2019s beautiful\u2026 The flowers, the candles\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOne for each month we were apart!\u201d I interject, too excited to keep my mouth shut. Lucy chokes back another sob, tears of unbridled joy running down her face. Smiling, I nod my head to the small box on the bench, releasing her shoulders as she steps forward, her heels clacking on the concrete. Leaning over, Lucy takes the box in a trembling hand, turning back to be with another sob as she cradles it near to her heart. \u201cGo ahead Lucy, open it.\u201d\n\nTaking a deep breath to calm herself, Lucy fans her eyes with one hand, the box held tightly in the other. She makes one final unsuccessful attempt to bite back tears before opening the box, letting out a squeal of excitement when she sees what\u2019s inside: A wedding band of simple gold, the not-insignificant diamond sparkling in the soft candle light amid its setting. Lucy\u2019s eyes momentarily diverted, I take the opportunity to get down on one knee before her, reaching my hands out to hers.\n\n\u201cLucy, will you marry

Reconnecting\n\nA summer breeze whipped through the quiet streets of Volcaldera, the wind providing some relief from the stifling temperature. Even as the sun completed its descent behind the bluff on the edge of town it was hot as balls, and I once again loosen the tie around my neck. Fang and I had just finished out dinner date at a fancy restaurant, but the hot summer night is making me regret suggesting we walk home rather than catching a cab. Fang herself seems unaffected by the heat, idly humming a tune as her tail wags in rhythm, her hand caught in mine. The amber pendant I had given her all those years ago hangs in the low neck of her dress, catching the final rays on the sun beautifully. I can\u2019t help but stare at her, smiling gently at just how wonderful she is. I had only just returned to Volcaldera last week, and already we were inseparable, just like before. \n\n\u201cAre you going to stare at me all night, dweeb?\u201d Fang interrupts my thoughts with a soft jab to the ribs, snapping me out of my reverie. I can see the faint blush still remaining on her face, evidence that I had been staring none to discreetly for some time now. \u201cWeren\u2019t we going back to your place?\u201d\n\nSmiling again, I give her hand a squeeze. \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm with a guy staring at his girlfriend, huh?\u201d Girlfriend. That word feels nice on my lips after all these years being apart. Sure, I visited Volcaldera when I could find the money too, but never for more than a week or so, the joyous occasion always tainted by the bitter knowledge that I would have to leave Fang again. We avoided the couple label then, finding it made our break easier. But now I was back, and I had no intention of leaving Fang again.\n\n\u201cOi, got a loicence fer starin\u2019 then, luv?\u201d Fang\u2019s British accent had not improved in the intervening years, but it made me laugh regardless. \u201cSeriously though, how far is your new place? I\u2019m dying out here.\u201d Fang beat her long eyelashes exaggeratedly, a little pout emphasizing her mock distress. \u201cIt\u2019s like, a hundred out here Anon, how can you stand that tie?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I thought dinos were supposed to like the heat\u201d, I retorted, pointing towards where my new apartment sat on the corner of the block. Luckily I was able to escape Skin Row this time around, my sound engineering degree paying off nicely, and I managed to land a nice upscale standalone apartment on the edge of downtown, not too far away from Fang\u2019s. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s just over there. I still can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t help me move in, how lazy are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey! I had to do that field trip, remember? To the museum? I made it clear that it was going to cost you one whole bag of dino-nuggies, and someone failed to deliver!\u201d Fang emphasizes her point with another soft jab in my ribs, the blow softened by how she never broke our hand-hold. Her voice dropped as her amber eyes darting up and down the empty block. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s more fun to see it for the first time now, Anon. I really am dying out here.\u201d Her voice was breathy, needy, full of unsaid promises that could only be confirmed when we were together alone. As Fang stared up at me with lidded eyes, it finally dawned on me why she was so needy: It was estrus season. I had been away for so long, been able to only visit in certain months of the year that I had forgotten when her time of the year was. Suddenly, memories of the last time Fang and I had been together for an estrus season came rushing back, the heat blossoming across my face having nothing to do with the setting sun. \n\n\u201cAh, well, that\u2019s, uh\u2026\u201d It was all I could do to stumble out something, anything, that resembled speech, as all the blood in my head made a mass exodus to a place a little further south. I was suddenly very glad that the streets were empty, trying to nonchalantly adjust the bulge that was growing in my jeans. Fang shifted her hand out of mine and into the small of my back, her claws tracing a delicate pattern through the thin fabric. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Anon, ptero got your tongue?\u201d Fang\u2019s words were pure honey as she moved her wing around my shoulder, forcing me to lean down towards her. Still walking, Fang extended her long tongue, lazily flicking my ear before briefly tracing the inner folds. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2026 cuddled, Anon,\u201d she said with a purr, her hand moving down to squeeze my ass. \u201cWhat are you waiting for, dweeb, let me in\u2026\u201d I was surprised to find that we were at the door to my apartment, my brain having decided that it had more important things to do than remember the intervening distance. \n\n\u201cAh, oh, yeah, sure! L-let me get the keys, and\u2026\u201d My hands moved in slow motion, the silver keys drawn to the lock as if by a magnet, however they worked. Fang\u2019s hands were all over me now, her earlier apprehension for passers-by proving a weak defense against the ranging torrent of hormones currently flowing her thick, powerful veins. The key penetrated the lock slowly, taking a complete and total pleasure of the experience as it entered the lock. The metallic sound of the mechanism was lost to me as Fang attacked my ear once more, moaning in anticipation. Something was wrong, however; even as I twisted the door handle like a madman, the door refused to budge, disallowing any entry like some sort of thick wooden chastity device. \n\n\u201cDoor\u2026stuck\u2026\u201d I mumbled, trying it once more as Fang\u2019s hands explored even lower on my body. I dared not turn my gaze away from the dull surface of the door, for fear that catching even a glimpse of Fang as she was right now would send me over the edge. Every available bit of blood seemed to be rushing to my mounting erection at this point, and my mouth seemed to have forgotten how words were formed. Sweat poured down my forehead, stinging my eyes. Never in my life did had I thought I would end up cockblocked by a door. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you have to turn the key, dweeb. See, like this\u2026\u201d Fang\u2019s honeyed words sounded far away as her hand crawled down mine, taking the key between two fingers and twisting, slowly. Tumblers shifted as the key rotated in the lock, forcing the door to yield its defense against our entry. Finally, the key could turn no more, and Fang rested her hand on mine, the other turning my head to face her. Fang\u2019s amber eyes shimmered in the fading light, seemingly burning with some sort of inner brightness as they drilled into mine. Her mouth was open, and I could hear her ragged breaths as she panted like the animal in heat that she was. Curiously, her breath was clouding in the air despite the heat, probably another consequence of my brain shutting down. Fang continued our gaze a moment more before twisting the door handle, guiding my hand to do the same. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got five estrus seasons to make up for, Anon.\u201d \n\nStop penis, I can only get so erect. \n","encoded":false,"Title":"Ending 4 - Reconnecting","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and

song from my barebones excuse of playing.\n>But seeing her in her most shut-in form was amazing.\n>Afterwards we\u2019ve practically been inseparable, much to the odd seething by Trish.\n>After that whole fiasco in the theater I\u2019m amazed I didn\u2019t strangle her right then and there.\n>Then again, I\u2019m not the only person in the world here.\n>But getting back to Fang, besides her more shut-in and (objectively) cute side, I noticed something else that I didn\u2019t realize before.\n>That way she sometimes gets in her stride on and off.\n>And I could swear that something was missing

textbook.\n>Glancing down at my assignment paper, save for a small splash of drool there\u2019s just a few (albeit tricky) problems left.\n>\u201dYeah, sorry, just dozing off.\u201d\n>She huffs in annoyance before turning to the sheet.\n>It takes a few minutes, but we get it done easily by helping each other out.\n>The bell rings and we step out towards the end of the horde of students.\n>\u201dSo what was the daydreaming about?\u201d\n>She turns her curious glance into a devilish grin.\n>\u201dThinking how sexy Mr. Carldewskii would be in a speedo\u2026?\u201d\n>I gag from

After school! Got it, asshole?\u201d\n>\u201dUh...sure.\u201d\n>She quickly walks down the hall, still slightly red from her embarrassment of her secret being found out.\n>Ah shit, I fucked up.\n>Shouldn\u2019t have pointed it out but fuck it, this is my life now.\n>Next few classes are a bit of a blur of thoughts to me.\n>Like I just walked into her changing.\n>Or more accurately finger blasting herself.\n>Wait, no, too far on that one.\n>Fang isn\u2019t taking it the hottest either, looking like she\u2019s about to die from embarrassment.\n>Wait, was she doing it TODAY too?\n>Did I just ruin her whole day because I noticed-\n>Before I can feel my brain melt out of my skull from my thoughts, my last class finishes, the blaring of the bell signaling us to go.\n>I take my things and exit through the door, seeing Fang following suit.\n>Raptor Jesus I\u2019m gonna get grilled, give me strength.\n>She waves a hand at me before signalling me to go with her.\n>Part of me honestly wants to say I had no idea what I was talking about earlier and bolt, but fuck it, I dug my own grave here.\n>I go and follow her and we get to a secluded spot under a tree that\u2019s a bit away from the school grounds.\n>She sighs, and sits down at the foot of it before taking out a cigarette.\n>\u201dSit, you idiot.\u201d\n>I just realized I\u2019ve been standing over and said nothing since we started walking here.\n>I quickly apologize and sit beside her, and she offers me one too.\n>I decline and she takes a quick drag before saying something.\n>\u201dOkaymaybeIlikewalkingaroundnaked\u201d\n>I blink.\n>\u201dI...what?\u201d\n>She grits her teeth before quickly looking pissed off at something.\nw>\u201dI-I just like walking around naked!\u201d\n>It\u2019s still not processing with me.\n>I can feel my inner hamster wheel turning in my brain but it's still not clicking.\n>\u201dWhat, like in your room? But not in public right? Youjust couldn\u2019t find underwear before you came to school, right?\u201d\n>She gives a giant glare at me while I look at her confused.\n>Suddenly it clicks.\n>Well less of a click and more of getting hit in the head with a brick.\n>It\u2019s a bad analogy but it works for right now.\n>\u201dYou have a...exhibitionist fetish?\u201d\n>She throws her hands forward to her sides, relieved that my retard brain finally worked it out.\n>Sorry Fang, I haven\u2019t updated my brain\u2019s processing power in five years.\n>\u201dYes! Jeeze, you\u2019re slow sometimes!\u201d\n>She huffs before taking another drag.\n>\u201dLook it...it just feels good, y\u2019know? It\u2019s like taking a hot shower or whatever.\u201d\n>She shakes her head, showing a small frown.\n>\u201dCrap, I knew it was a bad idea to do it today.\u201d\n>Fuck, act fast or else this could go downhill.\n>\u201dI think it\u2019s kinda hot.\u201d\n>FUCK\n>She quickly jolts her head up looking at me, beet red.\n>\u201dW-Wait, really?\u201d\n>Okay, slow down anon, you\u2019re gonna choke at some point-\n>\u201dYeah, I think it\u2019s pretty hot. Seeing you walking around in a skirt or something like that without underwear on or whatever.\u201d\n>WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING SLOW DOWN\n>\u201dHonestly it\u2019s kinda empowering that you do something like that. Really sticking it to the man, y\u2019know?\u201d\n>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n>Fang\u2019s mouth is agape, looking at me like I\u2019m suddenly talking in a different language.\n>I feel like I\u2019m possessed by a demon as I continue.\n>And hoo boy, it\u2019s not letting go soon.\n>\u201dLike there\u2019s this stigma against letting yourself be free to just experience the winds of Earth and bustle of the city while stark naked, getting the thrill of nonchalantly walking around or barely escaping getting caught. That\u2019s how you feel right?\u201d\n>She nods slowly, keeping the same face.\n>I hold her hand as I finish.\n>\u201dLook, Fang. I get it, and hell, I\u2019d even go far as to say help you with it. I love you, and want you to be happy. And so what if you have an odd kink? If it makes you happy then it makes me happy.\u201d\n>I smile warmly after what I consider to be the worst thing I have ever said.\n>It takes a few seconds before she responds quietly.\n>\u201dI...wow.\u201d\n>This is it.\n>She\u2019s gonna realize I\u2019m too autistic for her own good and run.\n>Fang suddenly jumps at me, quickly hugging me while she\u2019s got me pinned to the ground as I\u2019m still shook from surprise.\n>\u201dHoly shit, someone understands!\u201d\n>What.\n>She hugs a bit tighter before quickly letting go, blushing slightly.\n>\u201dUh, I mean, yeah. And uh, sorry.\u201d\n>I exhale before sitting back up.\n>\u201dIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\n>It was, in fact, not fine.\n>She was right on top of me.\n>A GIRL was on top of me.","encoded":false,"Title":"Exhibitionism","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Fang And Anon's Text-uality.txt":{"path":["Fang","Fang And Anon's Text-uality.txt"],"text":"Title: Fang And Anon's Text-uality\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Reed and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nFang and Anon's Text-uality\n\nThe halls are packed today as I make my way to my first period, keeping my eyes down. The events of the auditorium are still fresher in people\u2019s minds than I would like it to be, even no at the end of March. Fang is usually around to give me some backup (you wouldn\u2019t believe what a well-timed hiss from an angry ptero-GF can do to a snide comment), but she\u2019s busy today with a project for another class, leaving me to fend for myself. We\u2019ve been dating for almost a month now, our relationship really heating up since she spent those fateful days in my apartment. Things between Fang and Trish are still tense; Trish just can\u2019t take a hint to leave Fang alone, and every time I bring it up to Fang, she tries changing the subject, usually in dramatic and\u2026 suggestive ways. Still, all things considered things are looking up, and as I slip into Mr. Carleciidewski\u2019s classroom my phone buzzes, Fang\u2019s texts a welcome balm to sooth my worried soul.\n\nFang: hey\nAnon: hey :P\nFang: so we didn\u2019t get to spend much time together last night lol\nAnon: well your dad makes it pretty hard too, with all the wanting to murder me and stuff.\nFang: lol, you\u2019re getting pretty quick at leaping out my window :V\nFang: hands still burned?\n\nChuckling, I absently run my fingers across my palm, the red welts still slightly painful. Anything would be worth the time I get to spend with Fang, but that bedsheet rope has been killer.\n\nAnon: not too bad now\n\nAn ellipse from Fang lets me know she\u2019s writing something a little longer in response. Each time I shimmy out of her window, hearing her dad storm up the stairs like an avalanche, Fang always greets me the next morning at school with a consoling kiss on each palm, her amber eyes lowered seductively. I missed those kisses because of her stupid project today, just my luck to be snoot-blocked by freakin\u2019 schoolwork. \n\nFang: good you need those hands to help me in science and stuff lol :V you sittin in the back? can\u2019t let anyone peek lol\n\nGlancing at the clock, it\u2019s still a few minutes until the period starts. Most of the class has arrived, assembled in the desks in front of me. Reed gives me a little nod as he takes his seat near the front, his purple partner is crime mercifully absent once again. My reputation as a weeb hasn\u2019t done me any favors, and I\u2019ve taken refuge at the back of the class, thankful that Reed has given me some space. He tried sticking up for me when the class started targeting me, but I grew tired of the walled up balls of paper and other school supply detritus that was getting lobbed at my head. I was safer at the back now.\n\nAnon: nope I\u2019m pretty much a leaper now.\nFang: good <:V\nFang: ur hands r probably too sore to jerk it, huh? :V\n\nI can feel myself twitch as I read Fang\u2019s text. She\u2019s usually pretty playful when we fool around, but outside of making out in her bedroom we haven\u2019t done anything serious. Even though I know no one would bother looking my way twice, I shoot a quick glance to either side to make sure I\u2019m free from prying eyes.\n\nAnon: yeah lol\nAnon: been having to use a pasta claw lately\nAnon: feel like uncle Moe lol\nFang: gross lol don\u2019t make me think of that\nFang: maybe your girlfriend can help you out tonight :V\n\nI can feel the beginnings of a blush spread across my face. Leaning back, I tuck my phone beneath the desk, adding a little extra protection against any roving eyes. \n\nAnon: i dunno, what about those claws? :P\nFang: oh i can be real gentle\nFang: or maybe you want a claw-job huh? :V\nFang: never pegged you as a dino-fetishist. Gonna ask me to jerk you with my tail? Too short for that lol :V\n\nI subtly shift in my chair, hoping to hide my quickly-hardening member from the rest of the class. I\u2019m already a weeb-pariah, I don\u2019t need to be known as the guy who gets boners in class too. \n\nAnon: maybe just the hands for now ;)\nFang: hmmm okay, I can do that\nFang: draw you up to my room, maybe shove a sweatshirt under the door so no one can hear ;V\nFang: undo your belt, maybe just tear it off lol\nFang: you\u2019re probably pitching a tent just picturing it huh?\n\nShe knows me too well. \n\nAnon: maybe ;)\nFang: good ;V\nFang: I like making your dick hard\nFang: you know I can feel it when we make out right? Lol :V\nFang: pretty sexy thinking how big you are\nFang: makes me just wanna reach down and wrap my hands around that shaft\nFang: ur skin is soft against my scales as I work my hand up and down\nFang: givin u kisses on the neck as I jerk you off :V\n\nMore students filter into the classroom now, an orange triceratops girl with glasses reluctantly taking an open spot in my row. Even though she\u2019s as far as she can get from me, I still surreptitiously tilt the screen away from her. \n\nFang: fuck this is makin me wet lol ;V\nFang: 1 sec\n\nA minute or two passes before Fang writes again, the period bell ringing loudly. Mr. Carlekidiwsky doesn\u2019t seem to notice, his head still laid back, faint snores emanating from the dirty magazine draped haphazardly over his face. My phone buzzes once more, the message taking a little while to pop up. It\u2019s a selfie of Fang, seated in a bathroom stall. My eyes widen as I realize her pants are open, one hand thrust in her panties, the other held out to take the snapshot. Only her snoot is visible, but I can still see the wicked grin on her face.\n\nFang: might have been helping myself out too lol :V\nAnon: :O\nFang: you n\u2019 me tonight, ok?\nAnon: sure ;)\nFang: good lol, gonna make you squirt like I did ;V\nFang: oh, one more thing:\n\nFang\u2019s next message takes a while to arrive, the tardy bell finally kicking Mr. Carlikediwssky out of his slumber.\n\nFang: parents gonna be out of town tonight, some lame church thing, and Naser\u2019s got a track meet <;V\nFang: so maybe we do a little more than just jerking you off\nFang: okay?\n\nAt this point, my boner has assumed direct control of my body. Before I can type out my reply to Fang, though, the last thing I ever needed to hear shocks me out of my hormone-addled stupor. \n\u201cAlright you freakin\u2019 kids settle down! We\u2019ve got some freakin\u2019 hard problems today and I need some freakin\u2019 volunteers to come up and solve \u2018em! Anon, get your freakin\u2019 butt up here and do this first one okay?\u201d\n\nWell, my reputation couldn\u2019t get any worse.\n\n","encoded":false,"Title":"Fang And Anon's Text-uality","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Reed and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Fang Friday.txt":{"path":["Fang","Fang Friday.txt"],"text":"Title: Fang Friday\nStatus: Completed\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\nSummary: Fang and Anon doing their weekly ritual\n\n\nThe doors are locked, the alarm is armed and I can finally go home. I hate being the one who has to lock up. Especially on Fridays. Not only do I have to stay the longest while everyone else gets to leave, but I also miss out on precious minutes of the day. With a brisk pace, I walk to my car, throw my stuff and myself inside, and turn the ignition. The vehicle peels out of the parking lot and onto the street. Mercifully traffic isn't too bad today, so hopefully, I'll be home soon.\nFridays are very special to me since Fang and I always reserved them as 'us' time. It started back when we were still in high school. At first, it would be to study or watch the band practice. Later on, it turned into dates and hanging out in Fangs' room when her dad wasn't home. Sometimes it was even dinner and a show. The food was usually either dino nuggies or Moe's Meateor lovers pizza. The show was Fang playing whichever song she was working on or teaching me how to play something simple on the guitar. The college years were the worst since the only way we could hang out was by either voice or video chat. Thankfully Fang had an unlimited data plan and was always eager to call.\n\nPulling into the driveway I can already smell something delicious cooking. There was no doubt Fang wasn't a star cook, but her mom was. Samantha leaped at the opportunity to teach her baby girl how to properly prepare food. 'The way into a man's heart is through his stomach' she always said. Fang didn't need that to steal my heart, though it was still nice having some varied meals. Even the best pasta and nuggets get old after a while, and takeout has its own problems. Approaching the door, the smell gets stronger and I can hear a song playing. I step inside, the entire house smelling of something delicious. It was summer, and with school out, Fang had more time to make something extra special. I enter the kitchen to greet my ptero wife. She's busy behind the stove and doesn't notice me enter. Fang is wearing a black t-shirt with a logo from one of her favorite bands, most of the backside missing to make space for her wings. She has the same type of black jeans as she wore during high school, just not completely torn up. To top it off she's wearing, an admittedly cute, pink apron. No doubt a gift from her mom. While the sight might seem odd at first glance, it's nothing compared to the song that is currently playing from Fangs' phone. It's something I thought Fang wouldn't be caught dead listening to, yet here she was, singing and humming along. \n\nFang was using a wooden spoon to mix whichever soup she was making and rapidly wagging her tail to the song's frantic rhythm. She finishes tasting her dish just as the final chorus of the song kicks in. Using the wooden spoon as an impromptu microphone she sings the chorus, completely lost in the song.\n\u266aCause every time we touch, I get this feeling\u266b\n\u266bAnd every time we kiss, I swear I can fly\u266a\n\u266aCan't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last\u266b \n\u266bI need you by my side\u266a\nWith the song over she finally notices me standing at the doorway to the kitchen. I really don't want to laugh. Seeing Fang sing such a cheesy love song while wearing a pink apron is both incredibly cute, but also incredibly hilarious. Her face can't decide whether to turn pale or bright red and keeps switching between the two. \n\"H-hi Anon, did you just come home from work?\"\n\"I've been here for a bit\"\n\"So you...\"\n\"Yeah\"\n\"Well, you better not fucking tell anybody!\" Fang turns away to hide just how red her face had gotten. \"Like there's anything wrong with singing a love song if you're in love.\"\n\nI put down my stuff and approach her from behind. Before she can turn around I hug her from behind and place my head on her shoulder.\n\"I thought you sounded great. Who's the lucky guy though?\"\nFang lets out a sigh, \"You're such a dweeb.\" She rests her head against one of my arms and I can feel her tail struggle to wag while I'm pressed against her. \n\"So, what are you making?\"\n\"Just something from my moms' cookbook. Can't believe she let me borrow the thing.\" Fang takes the wooden spoon and grabs a bit of the soup she's making.\n\"Want a taste?\"\n\"Sure\"\nFang slowly moves the spoon towards my mouth, \"Just be careful, it's hot. You don't want to burn your mouth if you know what's good for you.\"\nI give it a quick blow before tasting, \"Wow, this is really good. Your mom would be proud.\"\n\"Mmhmm. Can you go set the table? I'm almost finished and I bet you're starving.\"\nI lift up my head from Fangs' shoulders, but my hands go from around her waist, to her hips, and all the way along her tail. As my hands reached her tail Fang tenses up and releases a quick shiver along with a stifled moan as my hands lightly brush her stubby appendage. \n\"You just can't wait, huh? I didn't cook all of this just so it would get cold. Dinner first.\"\n\nI set the table and Fang soon after serves the food. It's honestly really good. Admittedly, being made by my ptero wife made me biased. We chat about our day and before long the meal is finished, I even went back for seconds. \nAs we're taking care of the dished Fang can't resist asking again, \"Well? Did you like it?\n\"Of course, why wouldn't I?\"\nFang continued, remarkably sheepish, \"You're just saying that.\"\n\"No, I'm not. Remember the first thing you ever cooked? I made my feelings clear about that one.\"\n\"The world just wasn't ready for pizzas with a dino nugget stuffed crust.\"\nNeither was \/ck\/. Hopefully, that video never goes viral or Fang is going to kill me. As I'm finishing up Fang goes to the couch and picks up her old guitar that was resting next to it. I join her soon after. Even with her hands busy, she wordlessly extends her wing as an invitation. Settling in, Fang starts playing a variation of our song. My belly full, a soft wing as a blanket, and a lullaby playing I can do little to prevent my eyes from getting heavy. Adjusting myself a little bit, using Fangs' shoulder as an impromptu pillow I make myself comfortable. Just five minutes, I'm sure the love of my life wouldn't mind if I doze off for a bit. \n\nAfter a while, Fang notices Anon starting to lightly snore. She stops playing and, with the utmost care to not disturb Anons' sleep, gently places the guitar on the side of the couch. Fang reaches for a blanket prepared for just such an occasion. She drapes it over both of them and leans her body against Anon. Putting her other wing and both arms around anon, she completes her hug with a light peck on Anons' head. Her voice barely a whisper, Fang lets out an 'I love you' before also closing her eyes.","encoded":false,"Title":"Fang Friday","Status":"Completed","Characters":"Fang and

Bluffs"},"Heatwave Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Fang","Heatwave Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Heatwave\n\nChapter 2\n\nIt\u2019s even worse outside, the scorching air giving me a gut punch the moment we exit the apartment building. Fang is mostly unphased by the heat. She grabs my arm and we start moving at a brisk pace to the nearby DinoMart. I just hope my soles don\u2019t start melting on the scorching sidewalk. I want to ask Fang if she's being serious about being the one grilling or if this is just another joke. Can\u2019t talk in this heat though, if I open my mouth all the moisture will escape my body and I\u2019ll instantly be mummified. Thankfully we\u2019ve almost made it to the DinoMart and more importantly the AC inside the store. As we pass the threshold Fang gives me a concerned look, \u201cShit, you gonna be OK Anon? You look like you\u2019re about to pass out.\u201d I give her a quick affirming nod while doing my best to not appear like a little bitch who can\u2019t handle a little heat. Thankfully the store is mostly empty. A combination of the walk-in oven that is the outside world and an infamous neighborhood. At least no one will see the skinny suffering from early heat stroke. I grab a shopping trolley that has seen better days. Two of the wheels kept seizing up and the handle was sticky, but it was sturdy enough to give me some support. \n\nFang went on inside the shop and I did my best to keep up as she threw in things needed for the barbecue. Paper plates, paper cups, toothpicks, plastic utensils, garbage bags, paper towels. She gives some thought before picking which oil and charcoal to get. Fang glances back and gives me a concerned look, \u201cFeeling better yet?\u201d I give her a proper nod this time and Fang visibly relaxes. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s the boring crap done with, time for what everyone is waiting for.\u201d, Fang looks at me expectantly. \u201cSo, what do you want to eat Anon?\u201d I shrug since I don\u2019t care, which unexpectedly pissed of Fang. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that shit Anon. Either you pick something or you\u2019re sharing soy patties with Naomi\u201d, Fang wasn\u2019t taking \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 for an answer. I also didn\u2019t want to eat soy patties, because the next time some fucker on the internet called me a soyboy I couldn\u2019t just shrug it off anymore. \n\"I don't know, can't I have what you're having?\"\n\"How do you know you'll even like what I'm having?\"\n\"If your taste in food is as good as your taste in boyfriends I'm sure I'll like it,\" hopefully my gamble pays off.\n\"Wh-\", Fang stammers for a bit, getting more embarrassed by the second. \"Fine, but you owe me a special favor for being so indecisive,\" she moves closer to me and pulls me into a hug. \"You say stupid shit and mumble a lot, but sometimes you know exactly what to say,\" now it was my turn to be embarrassed. As the moment ended, there was still one burning question on my mind.\n\"Since when are you a barbecue expert anyway?\u201d Fang never talked about this part of her making it quite baffling. Who would expect a rocker chick to be well versed in the arts of grilling?  \n\n\u201cSince I was little. I liked being around my dad when he was grilling and when I was old enough to see the grill he\u2019d let me take over\u201d, a wave of nostalgia washed over Fang. \u201cI got good at it and by the end, he\u2019d let me be in charge of the whole thing while he mingled with guests. He was so proud\u201d, Fangs' voice becomes strained and it\u2019s clear it wasn\u2019t just good memories. \u201cThen I became a huge bitch and that was the end of that\u201d, Fang quickly composes herself and continues \u201cAnyway, DinoMart is no place for a therapy session, I\u2019ll get the meat and you go get some vegetables.\u201d With that Fang rushes to the butcher, the stroll down memory lane not being a pleasant one. \n\nI take my time getting to the vegetable section and realize Fang never told me what to get or how much. As I glance to the butcher I see Fangs' hands already full of various meaty delights for the grill. I just barely got here and she\u2019s already finished. As Fang turns around she gives me a little wave with her right wing and starts walking over. \u201cYou finished yet dweeb?\u201d, Fang gently places her haul into the trolley and looks at me \u201cWhat are you waiting for? We have to finish before this place gets robbed again\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never told me what to get or how much\u201d, I reply hoping to not piss her off.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost finished anyway, it\u2019s just this and the booze and we can go\u201d, Fang hands me a couple of plastic bags to hold while she piles in all the veggies she deems barbecue appropriate. Next up is the booze, we pick mostly mid to low-range stuff except for two bottles of top-shelf beer that Fang picked out. \n\n\u201cWon\u2019t the others be mad we only got the good stuff for ourselves\u201d, while I wouldn\u2019t mind sharing some good beer with Fang but I also didn\u2019t want the thing to be a source of pointless drama.\n\nFang lets out a laugh and puts the bottles gently into the trolley \u201cYou wish Anon, it\u2019s for the meat, not us\u201d. \n\n\u201cWhy are you wasting good beer by pouring it onto meat?\u201d not like I was an expert like her but it seemed stupid. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see when you taste it\u201d, Fang moves closer and brushes her hand against mine \u201cBut if you promise to be my assistant I\u2019m sure I could give you a few sips\u201d. I was sold on the spot.\n\n\nOn our way to the register, we walk past the freezer section. \u201cBefore today I\u2019d have thought the only thing you\u2019d eat grilled were dino nuggies\u201d, I was still trying to wrap my head around the fact that Fang has culinary skills beyond reading the instructions on a box of nuggets. \n\n\u201cThose are just my comfort food Anon\u201d, a twinge of sadness in her voice, \u201cFor the countless times I felt like shit.\u201d Fang just stares ahead, no doubt reliving some of those moments before shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019ve cut back on eating them so often though\u201d, Fang puts one of her wings around me before continuing, \u201cIn no small part thanks to you. When I\u2019m with you I\u2019m so very happy Anon, you have no idea.\u201d Her words fill me with incredible warmth with the little peck on my cheek from Fang being the cherry on top. \u201cDon\u2019t think that means you can stop stocking your fridge with nuggies though\u201d Fang slowly removes her wing from me and rubs my hand \u201cWe all have bad days from time to time.\u201d The short intimate moment ended we finally make it to the checkout and start piling the contents of the trolley on the conveyor belt. There\u2019s so much stuff, no way in hell will I be able to pay for this without selling my kidney to an Albanian. Fang just motions for me to start putting the groceries into bags and pays for everything with her card. As she\u2019s finishing up she looks over to me, \u201cOK Anon, this is where you start working on paying off your debt.\u201d Looks like I\u2019m going to have to carry all of this. Hopefully, I won\u2019t almost pass out. I split all the bags between my hands and hope I can make it to wherever Naser is meeting us without my skinny arms falling off. \n\nAs we\u2019re walking I try to bring up the money situation \u201cHow much is my share, maybe I can pay you back installments?\u201d\nFang feigns indignation \u201cWhat do you take me for Anon, a Rhinorex? Don\u2019t worry about the money, focus on not dropping any of that stuff or you\u2019ll never clear your debt.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are we meeting up with Naser anyway?\u201d better ask while I can still talk without wheezing. \n\u201cRight here\u201d, Fangs looks around looking for any sort of shade and failing to find any, \u201dHopefully before we both catch on fire.\u201d As if on queue the NasCar races around the corner and stops right in front of us. The curbside window barely manages to roll down before Naser starts shouting.\n\u201cGet in before some crackhead skinnie decides to shank us!\u201d Naser hates coming to SkinRow and I can\u2019t blame him. \u201cNo offense Anon.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken\u201d, it was a lie but it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t carry a pocket knife with me at all times in this neighborhood. As we\u2019re stuffing the grocery bags into the car Naomi starts running her mouth.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you guys called and told us about the creek. I was looking for a good spot for our little get-together for days. Can\u2019t believe Naser never told me about it\u201d, Naomis' voice was sickly sweet as ever. It\u2019s a wonder Naser hasn\u2019t developed a form of diabetes yet.\n\n\u201cHeh, must have slipped my mind babe\u201d, Naser doing his best to prevent another avalanche of candy-coated words from his saccharine other. With all the goods crammed inside the NasCar we barely have room for ourselves. Naser doesn\u2019t wait for us to get fully seated or even close the doors before hitting the gas.

Anonymous\n\n\nHello Rock Bottom - 00. Prologue\n\nWell, it finally happened. I guess everyone's had enough of my shit, and now I'm on my way to some stone quarry town all the way out in the boonies. God damnit, they just couldn't handle one last year of me?! Whatever, Mom and Dad didn't even try to understand me, sending me away to some backwater shithole, saying it's about \"Facing the real world\", FUCK THAT! Naser and Naomi, the asshole know-it-all's, always in my business, I swear I saw that bitch smile as I was leaving... Rosa and Stella, just a waste of time... Trish and Reed, my band mates and true friends, they understood who we were and knew what we wanted to do! Even if sometimes-\n\nI'm cut off mid-thought as I'm nearly thrown out the car by someone's reckless driving, \"What the fuck! Are you trying to fit in with these hicks already?!\" I shout over the squealing tires, gripping whatever handles I can reach as I try desperately to keep myself planted.\n\nNaser is fully concentrated on the road, getting back into the right lane before he speaks, \"Sorry, si-eems, like the roads aren't as maintained-\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" I cut him off, \"Your car can't handle it out here?\" I taunt, still keeping myself semi-braced for another wild maneuver.\n\nHe takes a breath, gripping the wheel for a moment before slowing down to a reasonable speed, relaxing a bit with a sigh, \"I don't want to mess with these pot holes, who knows how deep they are! If I hit one, that's it! And do you know how long it would take for-\"\n\nI've already tuned him out as he continues on about boring shit, taking the opportunity to look around now that everything isn't a blur. It seems like I'm trading palm trees and the beach for a bunch pine trees and hills. It's not a very exciting view, but I'm not sure if I'll miss home much either. Friends aside, dealing with everyone else was a pain in the ass. I let out a dejected sigh and check my phone for the weather this week, and see my suspicions confirmed, that it's already colder here than at home. Ffffuck. I also noticed I've somehow missed a few texts from Trish and Reed.\n\nT \"Saw that loser driving you around.\" \"We still good to hang out later?\"\nR \"heyy, everythin good, dude?\"\nT \"What's going on?\" \"Your mom saying you aren't going to VH this year?\" \"WTF\"\nR \"u looked kinda down when the nascar went by\"\nT \"Rock Bottom?\" \"That's so far away!\" \"Are you going to come back?\"\nR \"trish texted sayin ur mom said that ur goin 2 sum other school?\"\nT \"What about the band?\" \"This is bullshit!\" \"Hello?\" \"Text back when you can, please...\"\nR \"bruh, thats a bummer, ngl tho, goin to miss u this year, hope u can visit\"\n\nI set my phone aside and rub my temples, goddamnit I don't want to think about this now. But, AUGH! I didn't want any of this shit to happen! Fucking Naomi, that silver-tongued bitch, she had a hand this, I know it! I let out a frustrated sigh and look out again, seeing that the hills and trees have gotten much closer now, and a sign that reads-\n\n\"Rock Bottom,\" Naser's voice interrupts this time, car slowing down even more now as we pull into the outer limits, \"Home of-\"\n\n\"A bunch of dumbass hill billies who still eat rocks for a living.\" I laughed, but I'm still very fucking furious, \"Why the fuck am I being moved out here? I didn't even do anything!\" I cross my arms and huff, gritting my teeth as I close my eyes.\n\nNaser is silent for a few moments, before letting out a defeated sigh, \"Spears found out that you and your band were the ones that spray painted the school.\" He squeezes the wheel again, \"Lu-ook. Fang. Mom and Dad didn't have a choice,\" He holds up a hand before I could try cutting him off again, \"You of all people should know how much of a hardass Spears is about beautification.\" He looks around at every sign, making unsure turns, before letting out a frustrated sigh.\n\n\"But why the fuck is it only me getting the boot?! It was the band's ideal!\" I can feel the familiar sting of tears forming in my eyes and turn away, putting up a pissed off front as best I can. \n\nHe manages to find a gas station to stop at, but even with nothing distracting him now, he takes his time finding the words, \"Because, Spears is very convinced you're the leader...\" he constantly clenches his grip on the wheel for a moment, \"and as such, he decided that your punishment should be more severe.\" When I think I have a moment to speak, he suddenly blurts out, \"Dad managed to talk him out of charging you all with vandalism.\" He just stares blankly ahead, tapping the wheel as he's unsure of what to say anymore. It was like he just said something he wasn't supposed to.\n\nI guess he did, because I couldn't find the words I had before. We sit in an awkward silence, my mind racing with so many thoughts, that just drown the rest of the world out.\n\nI'm eventually stirred from my thoughts by Naser snapping his fingers in front of me, \"Hey, you ok, Fang?\"\n\n\"Huh? What?\" I look around in a daze and see we're parked at mostly empty street with plain brick buildings on both sides.\n\nHe lets out an apprehensive sigh as he points to the building right next to me, \"I said, we're at your apartment. You need any help taking in-\"\n\n\"Fuck you, I got it.\" I've already opened the car door, and the trunk clicks open on cue. I barely manage to hold everything in both arms, making clear as day that I'm not coming back for a second trip.\n\nHe's gotten out to close the trunk, and calls out, \"Your room is on the top floor, by the way. Your number and keys are-\" \n\n\"I got them right here, dickwing!\" I shout back at him as I get to the entryway, fumbling with the door handle a bit.\n\nI look at his reflection on the window, and see him stand near the driver door, \"If you need anything else, you know what to do. We'll visit during winter break, I think.\" He starts anxiously tapping the roof, \"I, I'll miss y-\"\n\n\"You can leave anytime...!\" I make a flicking motion with my wings, and crack open the door a little. I just want a bed to fall into already, this day has gone on far too long.\n\nIt takes a moment before he finally retreats back into the driver seat, hearing the gears shift and engine roar as he pulls away. When I don't hear the piece of junk anymore, I let out an exhausted sigh, and drag everything I had through the doorway. I'm still lost in thought as I carry everything through the building, my world literally feels like it's on my shoulders by the time I enter my apartment. Finally setting everything down doesn't ease the burden, and as I carry my guitar case to the bedroom, I know don't even have the energy to play.\n\nI lay the case next to me as I crawl into bed, giving it a tight embrace as I finally let the tears out. God damnit, why am I like this? All I feel I can do now, is to sing some wordless melodies, apart of a song I hear when I get like this. That song is all that brings me peace anymore, letting me slowly drift off to sleep.\n\nThere's nowhere to go but up now, right...?","encoded":false,"Title":"Hello Rock Bottom","Status":"On-going","Characters":"Fang and Naser","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"Series","Author":"Anonymous"},"IWTCIF - Sonic Heroes.txt":{"path":["Fang","IWTCIF - Sonic Heroes.txt"],"text":"Title: IWTCIF - Sonic Heroes\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nAlternate Title: Fucking Kill Me Please\n\n(Starts right after Fang vores Anon's lower face.)\n\nReinvigorated by our sloppy make out session, I begin my efforts of fucking her again, resulting in her moaning against my face and me groaning down her throat. My unga bunga caveman brain begins screaming at me once more. I LOVE PTEROS! I CRAVE PTEROS! \n\nI really should find these sorts of thoughts concerning,  but I'm not in a position to argue with my brain at the moment. There's more hormones than blood currently flowing through my veins, so I just weakly give in to my male instincts. I break my kiss with Fang as I grab hold of her legs, pushing them up and next to my head to give myself a better angle as I begin pounding into her even harder.\n\nI LOVE PTEROS! I CRAVE PTEROS! I'M PTERO FIEND! I'M PTERO-ING THIS PUSSY UP. These thoughts keep repeating through my head, but I know I'm not mumbling again this time. Instead, I'm just making autistic chimpanzee noises, which causes my goth lover to give me a look of growing concern. My hip thrusting becomes frantic at this point, reaching super sonic speeds that I'm sure are going to give my dick friction burns, even with Fang's girl juices coating it. \n\nShe's not even looking at me anymore, her head turned to the side and buried in her hands in complete and utter embarrassment. I know she's enjoying it though as I feel her legs shaking in my hands, as well as a fanning of my butt from the fast pace her tail is wagging. The thought of her orgasming is more than enough to also topple me over the edge as well.\n\n I feel something travel up and down the length of my shaft. My legs firmly plant themselves on the carpet. I bury myself into Fang's vagina one more time, my world spinning as I let out a mighty torrential storm of semen deep inside her. In between my massive loads,  my sex-addled brain tries to think of something catchy to top this moment off with. I immediately think of my childhood, and the mediocre game I spent the most time playing. For some reason, I think it's a good idea to scream it to the world.\n\n\"SONIC HEROOOES!\" The volume I shout this at feels like I'm ripping my vocal chords, and my partner simply looks up at me in complete horror. \"SOOONIIIC HEEEEEEROOOOOOES!!!\" I yell it even louder now, black splotches covering my vision as I feel myself slipping into darkness. \"Sooonic-\"...\n\nMy eyes suddenly jolt open as I look around. I'm back in my bed, sans my girlfriend, and I slowly lift my sore body up as I prepare to go and look for her. I don't don't even have to leave my blanket though, as I realize she's currently sitting at the edge of my bed and next to the night stand. My nose picks up the smell of flavored tobacco, and I finally realize what she's doing.\n\nShamefully I crawl over my flimsy mattress to join Fang, my legs now dangling off the edge of the bed frame and next to hers.  She knows I'm there, as she's quick to extend a wing around my back like a consoling arm. Outside of that though, she doesn't do anything else to acknowledge me. She instead focuses on finishing her menthol first, dumping the ashes in a glass of water after every large puff before also dumping the butt in.\n\n\"So.\" Breaking the silence, the pterodactyl finally speaks up. At the very least, she doesn't sound very angry. Just tired. Her head isn't still facing me, but I can tell now that she's looking at me with her peripheral vision. \"What the hell is Sonic Heroes?\". I silently mouth a string of profanities and curse my luck. I have a lot of explaining to do...\n\nNote From Archiveanon: I am going to personally kill you bruh. My fucking sides reached oblivion and now i am suffering lmao.

Bare to the wait, they faced each other across that hot tiled roof, their faces mirror images of each other. Despite their facial similarities, their bodies were different: One bore the heavy musculature of a man accustomed to combat, heavy white scars of battle crisscrossing his broad arms. The other man had honed his physique at his trusty neighborhood gym, the little time he could get access to the squat rack leaving him with plenty of functional strength. In another life, another time, they could be brothers: But now, they were enemies. \nThey stood several feet apart, neither having said a word since the other had shown up for their destined meeting. They knew that only one of them could be right, that there was only one correct answer to their question. Both were adamant that their way was correct, that the other couldn\u2019t be more wrong, and each was ready to defend their beliefs to the death. As the sun set, they were going to settle things in a way only two men could. \nNether man made a move, each waiting for the other to show his hand first. They stared at each other, pointedly ignoring the large hole in the fence encircling the roof. To look at that would be to admit that one of their brothers had failed, that another one of these pale clones had done the unspeakable. No, to them, there were only two options, and only one way off the roof.\nAnother howling gale causes the men to grit their teeth, the sand scourging both sets of eyes, causing them to water slightly. No other explanation could be given for why their eyes were cloudy with tears, of course; at least, none that these two men would admit. As the wind died down, each sensed the time was neigh, and both began to move, a silent circle of testosterone. \n\u201cFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG!\u201d The battle-scarred man screamed, keeping his arms to his side as he squared his shoulders, blowing his chest out to emphasize his point. \n\u201cLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCY!\u201d The other cried, just as loud as his brother, his hands rising above his head, palms-first, his elbows close to his waist. \nSuddenly the peace of the evening was shattered as the men flew at each other, landing blow after blow. Soon, the rooftop was stained with blood and sweat, each man fighting not just for his life, but what his life represented. It was a colossal battle of wills, two immovable objects coming face to face, neither one willing to yield, neither one willing to justify the other. \n\u201cMy god, they are such dweebs,\u201d Fang said, sitting on top of the rooftop that was raised above the rest, clad in her brown turtleneck and black jeans. \n\u201cSeriously,\u201d said Lucy, her yellow sun dress and red ribbion fluttering in the errant breeze.\n\u201cHey, play the song, guys.\u201d One Anon had the other in a headlock, muffling cries of \u201csplendid brother\u201d still audible above the choking. They had stopped fighting, quickly realizing there was no music playing.\nThe ptero-wives rolled their eyes, Lucy dragging the portable boombox over to them as Fang pressed the \u201cOn\u201d switch. \n\n\u2018What a thrill\u2026\u2019","encoded":false,"Title":"Metal Snoot Solid 4 - Autism of The Patriots","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Roomba on your Grave.txt":{"path":["Fang","Roomba on your Grave.txt"],"text":"Title: Roomba on Your Grave \nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 5 years since you recognized me, a chance encounter at a liquor store on the corner of Skin Row.

The graded midterm exam from Math class still mocks me from where I stuffed it into my backpack. That giant red \"D+\" Mr Delewski literally stamped in bold red ink is still fresh in my memory. Midterms were last Friday, and I bet it was an intentional cruelty to make everyone wait until Monday for the results. Things were already looking about as bad as I feared. Math was a complete wash, I only barely skated by English, and I only avoided disaster in music thanks to Fang's impromptu guitar lesson. Hopefully science would end the day on a high note and even things out. It was the one subject I actually had some confidence in.\n\nFang walked in just as the final bell rings, along with the rest of the stragglers in class. She takes her seat next to me without a word, crossing her arms over her stomach. Normally she would at least say hello or something, it doesn't take a genius to see she's nervous. I know science isn't her strong suit, but it's not like her to get nervous about a test result. She must have done even worse than I thought. Before I can think of something to say to Fang, Dr. Fernsworth takes his place behind his desk. The thick stack of papers he drops on the desk echoes like a guillotine throughout the classroom, everyone quickly falling deathly silent. He takes a moment to adjust his ridiculously thick glasses and clears his throat.\n\n\"Alright everyone, your exams have all been graded.\" He announces, a little unnecessarily. I doubt anyone couldn't have figured that out. \"I'll hand them back in alphabetical order. Please come up an collect your exam when I call your name.\"\nAs usual, my name is called first. Fernsworth gives me a small smile as I collect the packet and read my score. Eighty-five out of a hundred, a solid \"B\". Pretty good, honestly. Fernsworth's tests are notorious around campus, so I'm not disappointed with a \"B\" in my best class. When I sit back down next to Fang, she immediately looks over my shoulder to read my score.\n\n\"You got a 'B'?\" She asks, sounding a little surprised, \"I thought you'd get an 'A'...\"\n\n\"Yeah, well I didn't get to study as much an I wanted.\" I reply, instantly realizing how badly I stuck my foot in my mouth. \"Not that I regret hanging out with you or anything! I mean, I only passed music because-\"\n\n\"Hey, can I see your exam?\" Fang asks, ignoring the verbal spaghetti coming out of my mouth. I hand the packet over to her, happy to sidestep whatever embarrassing thing I was about to say next. Fang must be really impatient about all this, her name is about to come up soon anyway. She flips the pages back and forth, skimming over my answers. Judging by her expression, she doesn't like what she sees. Her grip is actually starting to crinkle the paper a little, and she's so focused she doesn't even hear Fernsworth call her name the first time.\n\n\"Fang!\" He repeats himself, finally getting her attention, \"Please come up and collect your exam.\"\n\nFang marches briskly up to Fernsworth's desk, snatching back her exam with a scowl. Fernsworth kept the exam face down when he handed it back, but I can see the red ink staining the back of the pages from here. Fang barely glances at the front as she walks back before she angrily stuffs it into her backpack, not even bothering to look through it. Fang quietly growls in anger as she sits next to me, her fingers drumming hard against the table. Talking to her now might not be the best idea, especially considering how well I did on the test. I'll give her some time to simmer down before I try to approach her.\n\nFernsworth steadily hands back the rest of the class, each student either subtly groaning in disappointment or sighing in stressed relief. A quite murmur of conversation grows as everyone starts comparing scores, debating answers, or bemoaning their ruined GPA. After Fersworth hands back the last test, he adjusts his lab-coat and clears his throat. Stepping in front of his desk, he taps the surface with a ruler to get everyone's attention.\n\n\"Now then, I know this exam was quite a bit harder than the rest of your classes.\" He begins, with what feels like the understatement of the semester, \"I know many of you aren't happy with your current grades. For students who want to improve their scores, I have good news! As extra credit you may submit an additional science project, along with a minimum five page essay, due no later than next Monday.\"\n\nSeveral students groan audibly, dismayed at both the size requirement and the tight deadline. I can't help but agree with them. An entire project, and essay, due by next week? No chance in hell I'm putting myself through that, even if I had needed the help. From the sound of it though, some people might not have much of a choice in the matter. I turn to gauge Fang's reaction, but it looks like she's too busy staring out the window to pay much attention to Fernsworth's offer.\n\nAs usual, I decide to crash in the auditorium after school with the Fang Gang. It's not like I have anything better to do, I can shitpost perfectly fine on my phone while the band practices. Honestly 'practice' might be a bit of a strong word for it. Half the time we just talk shit and hang out, laughing at Reed's ridiculous song lyrics or just passing the usual campus gossip. Trish has begrudgingly accepted my presence by now, even if she still routinely insists I'm 'distracting' Fang from practice. For now though, the band is actually playing. They've been trying to get through one of Reed's new songs for some time now, and even I can tell they're having a rough time of it. They've had to restart more times than I can count, everyone keeps falling out of tempo with each other. Fang is visibly frustrated, Trish is losing her patience, and even Reed's chill attitude is starting to show it's edges. Finally after yet another false start, Trish unslings her bass in frustration.\n\n\"Fang, what is with you today?\" Trish groans, throwing her head back, \"That's the fifth time you were late coming in! Are you even paying attention?\"\n\n\"Shut up Trish.\" Fang snarls, her wings starting to fan out aggressively, \"I don't need more shit to deal with today.\"\n\n\"Woah, hey, c'mon guys.\" Reed holds up his hands defensively, trying to curtail the impending shouting match, \"Let's just take a breather, you know? Just chill out and-\"\n\n\"We can't just take breaks all the time!\" Trish retorts, rounding on Reed, \"We need to be perfect for our next show!\"\n\n\"What next show?\" Fang mumbles, looking down morosely at her guitar. That seems to snap Trish out of her tirade, as both she and Reed suddenly look very worried.\n\n\"Fang? What do you mean by that?\" Trish asks, her anger evaporating in an instant. Fang visibly cringes, her hands subconsciously drifting to her wings as they pull close.\n\n\"My Dad said I can't play in the band anymore if I fail my midterms,\" Fang explains, her eyes locked on the floor, \"and I totally bombed Fernsworth's test last week.\"\n\n\"H-He can't do that!\" Trish shouts, clearly in denial. I can't help but imagine Trish angrily standing up to Ripley, and there's just no way that works out well. No amount of chutzpah can compete with that mountain of homicidal pteradon. Trish shakes her head, clenching her fists at her sides. \"No, the band is too important. He can't just make you quit!\"\n\n\"Well what do you want me to do about it?\" Fang asks, exasperated, \"I can't just sneak out every night!\"\n\n\"Yes you can!\" Trish retorts, getting desperate, \"He can't control your life! We could skip class or-\"\n\n\"What about the extra credit project?\" I blurt out, interrupting Trish's tirade. I haven't thought any of this through, I just said the first thing that had popped into my head. Now that I have everyone's attention, I just roll with it and hope for the best. \"Maybe your Dad will ease off if you bump up your grade?\"\n\n\"Heyyyyy that's a great idea Anon.\" Reed shoots me some finger guns, \"Fang just needs to throw together a paper volcano or something, and it's all good!\"\n\n\"It's not that easy, Fernsworth's a total hard-ass.\" Fang groans, \"He wants a real project and everything, including a paper. I'd have to work like crazy all week.\"\n\n\"You don't have time for that!\" Trish protests, \"We need to keep practicing for our next show!\"\n\n\"I didn't even say I was going to do it!\" Fang snaps back, \"Besides, does anybody have a better idea?\"\n\nTrish looks like she's about to say anything, but stops, staring angrily at the floor. Reed just scratches the back of his head and stays silent, unwilling to speak up at all. I keep my mouth shut as well. Despite Fang's reluctance, it seems like she already came to a decision.\n\n\"Fine then, I'm done with practice today.\" Fang announces, stowing her guitar back in it's case. Grabs her own bass case with a huff, glaring at me the entire time, as if this whole situation is somehow my fault. Reed just grabs his thermos and takes several big swigs, clearly intending to clock out for the rest of the afternoon. The mood in the room is pretty much ruined at this point, so I take the opportunity to bounce. I wave goodbye to Fang and Reed and head home, mentally debating on what I want to microwave for dinner tonight.\n\nLater that night, I'm awoken by the sound of my phone vibrating on the nightstand. Groaning in annoyance, I blindly flail my hand over until it slaps against the plastic case. I fumble with the power cord and the home button, blidning myself with the screen brightness as it turns on. Cursing and blinking my eyes clear, I squint at the new notifications. Looks like Fang has been texting me.\n\nF: \"Hey dork. You up?\"\nF: \"My Dad said he'll lay off me if I do the project. I can't think of a topic though.\"\nF: \"You have any stupid ideas?\"\n\nSleep deprived, I immediately type back the first thing on my mind\n\n> A: \"Fang, it's 2am. I was asleep.\"\n\nImmediately after I hit send, I regret it. If Fang is still up this late, she must have been stressing about the project pretty bad. Rubbing my stinging eyes, I quickly type another message.\n\n> A: \"Yeah, sure. Let's meet up tomorrow. I'll try to think of something.\"\n\nI turn the phone on silent and toss it back on the nightstand, blinking the afterimages out of my eyes. Hopefully I haven't woken up completely, and I can get back to sleep quickly.\n\nThe next morning I sleepily trudge to school, stifling yet another yawn. Climbing out of bed had been an absolute chore today, and I can tell I'll be fighting sleep all day. As I groggily climb the front steps of the school, I spot Fang waiting for me by the doors. Shit, that's right, I was supposed to help think of project ideas.\n\n\"Hey Anon. Damn, you look like shit today.\" Fang grins as I groan in response. I push the front door open with my shoulder and head for my locker, Fang taking up stride beside me. There's already plenty of other students in the halls digging through their lockers or grouchily nursing cups of coffee\n\n\"So...\" Fang begins, leaning against the locker next to mine while I spin the lock, \"Did you come up with anything for the project?\"\n\nI hesitate, taking my time collecting my textbooks and binders. I hadn't come up with any ideas since Fang's texts last night, but now that I think about it, should I? This is supposed to be her project, I can't just do it for her. Besides the fact Fernsworth would immediately notice and likely fail her, I just shouldn't patronize Fang like that. She's smarter than she thinks, I'm sure she can pull this off on her own.\n\n\"I don't know, another railgun is probably a bad idea.\" I begin, Fang chuckling as she remembers that particular disaster.\n\n\"Yeah, I think Fernsworth is still a little mad about the window.\" Fang agrees as I sling my backpack back over my shoulder, \"Seriously though, no ideas? I'm totally stumped here.\"\n\nShe hits me those big pleading eyes, and I feel my willpower begin to crumble. No, stay strong Anon! This is for her own good, she can do this! I must resist those beautiful golden eyes! Fang softly flutters those big eyelashes, and I realize I never stood a chance to begin with.\n\n\"Well...\" I concede, scrambling for an idea, \"What if you built something cool and wrote the paper about that? I don't think Fernsworth is that picky about the topic, as long as you don't half-ass it.\"\n\n\"The only thing I can do with a hammer is smash stuff.\" Fang pouts, \"Naser was the one who got all the handyman lessons from Dad.\" She actually sounds a little envious, she must have thought about this before.\n\n\"Trust me, holding the flashlight isn't as fun as it sounds.\" I reply, following Fang to her first class, \"Listen, I'll catch you at lunch. If you don't think of anything before then, I'm sure someone will have an idea. Sound good?\"\n\n\"Yeah, alright.\" Fang fist-bumps me with a weary smile, waving goodbye as we part ways in the hall. I head for first period English, hoping Jin won't catch me sleeping in the back of class again.\n\nLunch period eventually arrives, and by now I feel much better. It's amazing what a few power-naps and the promise of food can do to perk somebody up. Fang is already at the usual table, along with the rest of the gang. Reed gives me his usual \"Sup\" in greeting as I sit down, while Trish tries for the hundredth time to murder me with her eyes. Fang looks lost in thought, staring off into space as she taps her fork against the table in an improvised beat.\n\n\"Hey Fang, did you think of anything?\" I ask, snapping her out of her own head.\n\n\"Actually, yeah. I think so.\" Fang smiles, Reed and Trish turning their attention toward her. \"I think I'm going to try to build an electric guitar.\"\n\n\"Damn, really?\" I ask, more than a little skeptical at the idea. I don't really know anything about electric guitars, or what went into building one, but I had the distinct impression it would be difficult. \n\n\"Obviously not from scratch,\" Fang explains, tapping the table with her fork again, \"If I find some spare parts and just assemble them, it shouldn't be too hard. I can write the paper about the wiring, sound waves, and the other technical junk. That should be enough for a project, right?\"\n\n\"You're going to need a soldering iron.\" Reed chimes in, counting on his fingers, \"Not to mention pickups, potentiometers, capacitors, and that's just the electrical. You might have to do a vintage wiring assembly if the parts are too old for- what?\"\n\nEveryone is just staring at Reed, wondering where the heck all that just came from. I know Reed does all the electrical work for the band, but I didn't expect that level of technical jargon from him. Once again I'm left wondering just what else is hiding behind that stoned dude-bro personality of his.\n\n\"Yeah, I'll need all that stuff.\" Fang agrees, looking a little unsure of herself now, \"I'll also need a place to work, I don't think I can do this on my desk at home. Any ideas?\"\n\n\"I think the shop class has a couple soldering guns.\" I answer, thinking back to the few times I walked by that rarely used classroom, \"There's probably some other stuff in there we can use.\"\n\n\"So you'll help?\" Fang asks hopefully, and I realize I had just committed myself. I nod in agreement along with Reed, who as usual seems perfectly fine with whatever the newest crazy scheme is.\n\n\"I still say this is a waste of time.\" Trish objects, crossing her arms. \"Let's just keep practicing after school and you can tell your dad you're working on your project. He'll forget about all this eventually.\"\n\n\"Then you clearly don't know my dad.\" Fang scowls, \"He's watching me like a hawk. He's not just going to let this drop.\"\n\n\"We'll probably have to ask the shop teacher to use the classroom.\" I interject, cutting Trish off before she can start another argument. \"Who's the shop teacher anyway?\"\n\n\"Mr. Delewski.\" Reed answers, much to my disappointment. Of course that slob would be the school shop teacher. Getting him to look up from his magazines would be hard enough, convincing him to do any kind of favor would be near impossible.\n\nThe lunch bell rings before I can reply, startling everyone at the table. The four of us quickly stand up while shoveling down the remnants of our neglected lunches. Discarding our empty trays, we split up in the hall and head to our next classes. Science was next, so Fang and I walk together to Fernsworth's classroom. \n\n\"Hey Anon,\" Fang stops me outside the door, \"You mind coming with me to see Delewski after school? He might cave more easily if there's two of us.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure.\" I agree. I've already learned my lesson today about trying to deny her. I just don't have the willpower to compete with those pleading eyes.\n\n\"Thanks dork.\" Fang pulls me into a tight hug, my face immediately burning up. It only lasts a moment, Fang must have remembered we're in a crowded hallway, so she quickly shoves me away and practically runs into the classroom. I take a moment to collect myself, painfully aware of the several students looking in my direction. Hopefully that won't start any rumors, but I know better than to expect otherwise.\n\n\nAs the last bell rings for the day, I work my way against the river of students heading for the front doors. Finally squeezing past the last of the crowd, I head for Mr. Delewski's classroom. Hopefully he's actually still here, and didn't somehow leave campus before everyone else. Fang is waiting for me outside his door, leaning against the lockers. She nods towards the door as I walk up, opening it and heading in.\n\nIt seems Mr. Delewski's desire to go home had been outweighed by his sheer laziness. He's already asleep at his desk, snoring loudly with a magazine draped over his face. Now that I think about it, maybe he just lives in here, eating in the cafeteria and showering in the gym. It honestly isn't that far-fetched.\n\nFang clears her throat once, then twice, but Mr Delewski just keeps snoring. Realizing that something subtle won't work, Fang snatches the magazine from his face and immediately drops it in disgust. God, that damn thing looks a little crusty. Fang angrily wipes her hand on her jeans, debating her next move. She leans in to poke Delewski with her finger, hesitates for a moment, then jabs him hard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Huh? Whazza-?\" Mr Delewski sputters, jolting upright in his seat, \"I swear I didn't- oh, it's just yous twos.\" He hastily brushes the crumbs off his chest and wipes off his face, pulling together at least a thin fa\u00e7ade of professionalism. Delewski folds his hands on the desk, looking between the two of us suspiciously.\n\n\"Now Anon,\" He begins, settling on me, \"I thought I told you I don't do any of that whole 'extra credit' nonsense. If you want to pull your grade outta the trash barrel, you gotta put the work in. Or at least, you know, pass over at least three figures.\"\n\nAn awkward silence hangs in the air as I try to figure out of he's serious. \n\n\"Ha ha ha! I'm just yanking your chain here!\" Delewski laughs nervously, sweat visible on his forehead, \"Although if you were down for that, I would not be opposed. Moe will, and I say this literally, break my arms next week if I don't pay him.\"\n\n\"No, uh... we just need a favor.\" I explain, trying not to think too much about what I just heard. I nudge Fang in the side, breaking her out of her stunned silence.\n\n\"Yeah, right.\" Fang composes herself, \"We need to use the shop class after school for Fernsworth's science project.\"\n\n\"Uh huh, yeah. Sure you do.\" Delewski replies, already bored, \"And uh... what does this have to do with me?\"\n\n\"You're...the shop teacher?\" I awkwardly answer. Delewski just keeps staring at me, so I press on, \"I think we need your permission or something?\"\n\n\"Yeah, you do.\" Delewski replies sternly, \"And I don't feel like giving it, so there.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Fang asks angrily,  \"I said it's for a school project!\"\n\n\"Because I am a respectable fauciltor of this educating institution.\" Delewski answers, \"That means I don't just hand out my friggin' keys to anybody who asks!\"\n\n\"It's. for. a. project.\" Fang repeats, visibly losing her patience. I can see the feathers on her wings begin to puff out, she's close to snapping.\n\n\"Come on, this is important.\" I plead, getting desperate. \"What do we need to do for this to work?\"\n\n\"Anon, listen, I like ya. You're not a complete dumbass\" Delewski replies, sounding almost sincere. \"I get that you wanna sneak off with your, admittedly pretty hot, punk rock dino girlfriend here. More power to ya. Personally, I would not be willing to put my package within six inches of those little needle teeth. It looks like a meatball sub of pain. You're braver man than I am. Now I don't know what kinda freaky carpentry themed bdsm thing you two are into, and I don't judge you for that. You do you. That said, I can't afford to lose this job. Literally. So my answer is still no.\"\n\nI sputter in embarrassment, a thousand denials and protests jumbling over each other. I should insist Fang and I aren't together, but she's right here! I mean, it's not like we are dating, but should I instantly deny the accusation? Is that a good idea, a bad idea, or neither? How can a teacher say something like that anyway??\n\n\"That means scram you two!\" Mr Delewski stands up, pushing us out the door. \"Go find some other place for your biology lesson. I have, uh... important literature to catch up on.\"\n\nThe classroom door slams in my face, lock turning from the inside. I stare at the frosted glass, mentally struggling to get a sentence together.\n\n\"What the fuck??\" I shout. Yeah, that seems like a good one given the circumstances. \"How the hell did he ever become a teacher?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me dweeb, maybe it's a quota thing.\" Fang answers. She seems somehow unperturbed by that disaster, but I notice she's pretty intently looking away from me. \"Screw him anyway, let's get out of here.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that was never going to work.\" I concede as Fang storms off. I trail behind at a distance, making sure to lock my gaze on the lockers instead of...anything else. \"So where to now? Any other ideas?\"\n\n\"Let's go meet up with Reed and Trish.\" Fang answers, heading down the stairs into the school's lower level, \"They should be waiting for us outside the shop.\"\n\n\"You uh... planning on breaking in?\" I ask. I don't know if Fang can pick locks, but I wouldn't put it past her. Lockpicking was one of those things I was mildly interested in for an afternoon, before I realized it was way more work than I thought. Fang though, I could see her really learning how.\n\n\"No dork, we'll just use these.\" Fang replies, twirling a keychain merrily around her finger. She turns back and gives me a big cheeky grin, looking triumphant.\n\n\"You stole his keys??\" I sputter, surprised, \"How the heck did you do that?\"\n\n\"I just swiped them off his desk when he wasn't looking.\" Fang smirks, tossing the keychain in the air and catching it, \"I doubt he'll even notice until tomorrow, and he'll never admit he lost them. I'll just slide them back when we're done next week.\"\n\nI spot Reed and Trish waiting outside one of the few classrooms down on this level. Most of the doors in the school's lower level lead to janitorial closets, storerooms, or the cesspool of sweat and cheap deodorant known as the gym locker rooms. The lockers are old, rusted, and unused. The only classes that take place down here are those that barely have enough students to justify existing. Nobody comes down here unless they have a good reason, or they just don't want to be seen. Back in the corner is the shop class, tucked away where the sound of power tools won't disturb anyone. Not that there was really any risk of that to begin with. Reed is lounging against the door next to Trish, who is busy angrily tapping something into her phone.\n\n\"Sup Fang?\" Reed asks, capping his thermos and tossing it in his bag, \"We all good?\"\n\n\"You know it.\" Fang grins, unlocking the door. The four of us head in, fanning out and inspecting the room. I flick on the the overhead fluorescent lights, which sputter to life and emit a low droning buzz as I look around. It looks just like the shop class from my old school. Cheap wooden tables are arranged around the center of the floor, all covered with scratches, paint splotches, and vulgar amateur carvings. The floor is crossed here and there by thick power cables, scotch taped to the linoleum. Against the walls are all the saws, drills, lathes, and other potential finger removal devices I would expect to find in a school shop class. The large cabinet in the corner must be full of hand tools, Fang and Trish are already rummaging through it and assembling a pile. Reed has his head buried in one of the low cabinets, tail swishing across the floor like a giant fluffy broom as he rummages around.\n\n\"Hey, I found it!\" Reed shouts from inside the cabinet. He pulls himself out, holding an abused soldering iron and a thick roll of silver wire. He drops the bundle on one of the tables, along with the various tools Fang and Trish gathered.\n\n\"Right, so. Um...\" Fang looks around uncertainly, the scale of the task starting to sink in, \"I guess we better get started.\"\n\n\"We still need parts, and a working wiring diagram.\" Reed points out, slipping back into his technical expertise. \"I can look around my usual place for spare parts while you draft up a plan.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we can do that!\" Trish chimes in, suspiciously enthusiastic, \"Anon can come with and help out while Fang and I work here.\"\n\n\"Sure, no problem.\" I agree, gritting my teeth. Trish you duplicitous bitch, is there anything you won't do to get rid of me? I'll take the hit this time, since hanging out with Reed actually sounds alright, and this is supposed to be Fang's project. I can't just babysit her the entire time.\n\n\"Sweet, let's go Anon!\" Reed slaps my shoulder, heading back out into the hallway. I follow after him, stopping reluctantly for just a moment. I look back at Fang, who smiles and waves me off with a vague 'shoo' motion. She'll be fine, Fang can look after herself. I should really have more faith in her. \n\nI follow Reed outside and across the parking lot, toward what I can only assume is his car. If I had been forced to describe Reed's car before today, I would have been pretty much spot on.  I can't tell where the rust ends and the faded red pain begins. No two tires match, the trunk is held closed by bungee cords, and the bumper looks like it's one speed-bump away from completely falling off. This thing was probably a junker when my dad was in high-school.\n\nReed opens the door and jumps in, leaning over to the passenger seat and tossing a pile of empty cans behind him. I wrench the passenger door open, the rusted metal screeching in protest, and settle into the musty seat. At least the upholstery is mostly intact, more or less. Reed turns the key and the engine sputters to life, spewing acrid black smoke out the tailpipe. Before I can ask what happened to the missing seatbelt, Reed slams the gear into reverse and peels out, careening around the parking lot and flying onto the road.\n\n\"So, Reed. Where are we going?\" I ask, pushing myself off the door and climbing back into my seat. I hope this rolling scrapyard doesn't get us pulled over. Judging by the amount of glass audibly clinking together in the trunk, the police wouldn't just us off with a stern warning.\n\n\"Just a little pawn shop down by the waterfront.\" Reed answers, popping an honest to god cassette tape into the radio. After fiddling with a few knobs, the familiar sound of Fang's band begins crackling through the abused speakers. At least it's one of their newer songs, or so I think anyway, it's hard to tell through all the popping and static. Bouncing over a pothole, a particularly loud creak of metal draws my attention down to my feet. I notice a small draft on my ankles, and as I look closer I glimpse speeding asphalt through a peephole in the floor.\n\n\"Jesus man, do you have a raccoon living in here?\" I ask, warily checking seats behind me. Who knows what's buried under all those soda cans, cannibalized speakers, and fast food bags.\n\n\"No man, of course not.\" Reed laughs, swerving around a corner and bouncing over the curb. \"Not since the possum moved in at least.\"\n\nThirty harrowing minutes later Reed careens into an old, abused asphalt lot down in the waterfront district. I haven't been through this part of town before, but it reminds me a little too much of Skin Row. Too many boarded up windows, too much graffiti, and too many people warily looking over their shoulders. Most of the buildings are squat, utilitarian concrete structures, probably former warehouses and factories from back when the port was more active. Reed picks a random patch of asphalt to park on and kills the sputtering engine, climbing out and stretching his arms overhead. I try the broken handle on my own door a couple times, before resorting to just kicking the damn thing open. I doubt Reed minds the abuse, he doesn't say anything about it at least.\n\n\"You said you've been here before, right?\" I ask, trying not to look like a lost tourist. Normally I would be worried about leaving a car out here, but who in their right mind would steal this piece of junk?\n\n\"Oh yeah, this is where I get all the stuff for our shows.\" Reed replies, leading the way toward one of the nearby buildings. I follow after him, determined to not get left alone out here. It doesn't look like a store or anything to me. There aren't any signs or windows, just some old weather-worn posters stuck to the walls. This honestly looks like the back door to me. Unperturbed, Reed strides up to the thick metal door and pulls it open, holding ajar for me to follow him inside. A pair of faint electronic pings signal whoever must own this place that we walked, and a feminine voice calls back from further inside the building, \"Hey! Who just came in through there?\"\n\n\"It's me!\" Reed shouts back, \"Just need to pick up some stuff, be out in a sec!\" Reed must really come here often if the owner recognizes his voice. Surely that means I can afford to relax, if only a little bit. I follow Reed deeper into the building, squeezing past crowded metal shelves stacked with old cardboard boxes containing who knows what. The yellow tinted fluorescent lights overhead add to the stuffy atmosphere, the air thick with the swirling scents of mold, oil, and cigarette smoke. This place looks like the backroom of a warehouse, or some hoarder's basement. l I don't know how anyone is supposed to find anything in here, but Reed seems to know where he's going.\n\n\"What are we looking for exactly?\" I ask, peering into one of the nearby boxes. Just looks like a pile of mismatched scrap metal to me, I have no idea what any of it's for.\n\n\"Like I said, guitar electronics.\" Reed answers, rummaging through several boxes on a low shelf. \"Pickups, potentiometers, capacitors, not to mention spare wiring. Plus jacks, knobs,-\"\n\n\"Right, yeah.\" I interrupt, squatting down and trying to look over his shoulder, \"I don't know what any of that looks like, how am I supposed to help?\"\n\n\"Check that shelf.\" Reed points across the room, past a pile of faded magazines stacked against the wall. \"There should be some junked instruments over there, I'll see what we can rip out.\"\n\n\nThe next couple hours pass by quickly as Reed and I fall into a rhythm. I rummage through the boxes Reed mentioned, pulling out scraps of old busted guitars and other electronic instruments. Once I have a decent pile, I haul them over to Reed for inspection. Most of them he dismisses as useless, but several are in decent enough shape for salvage. Once we've got enough to work on, Reed shows me how to get the cases open and dismantle the interior electronics. We have to go rummaging for tools we could use, but luckily Reed knows where to find those as well. Once he shows me how to do the first couple, I start working on several myself. Slowly I learn how to differentiate the more generic pieces we're looking for, and Reed moves on to look for more particular things. I'm starting to get more of an appreciation for everything Reed does for Fang's band. How many hours has he spent rummaging around back here, disassembling and reconstructing all the equipment they use for a show? Do Trish and Fang even know how much effort he's putting into this? It's clear he's entirely self taught, which is damn impressive.\n\nEventually we have an entire milk crate filled with scrap electronics and mismatched guitar parts. I stand up, cracking my sore back, and grab our box of salvage. Following Reed through the labyrinth of shelves, we head to what I assume is the front of the shop. Things up here actually look a little more presentable, at least by comparison. There's room to walk, and some of the \"finer\" products for sale are actually on display. This place is definitely some kind of pawn shop, or maybe an antique store. I actually spot some old retro SNES games locked up in a glass case, but I know we don't have the time to just browse. Maybe I can come back another time with Reed.\n\nI drop the milk crate on the counter and get my first look at the cashier. If I didn't know better, I would have sworn that is Reed. If Reed was a girl anyway. She has the same pink scales, fluffy mane, and laid back sense of style. She leans over the glass countertop, obscuring the display of mall-ninja cutlery, and gives me a friendly smile.\n\n\"Hey, you must be Anon right? Name's Reeda.\" She introduces herself, her tied off tank-top not leaving much to the imagination. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that she's Reed's sister, which explains how she's so familiar with him. The resemblance is uncanny, except for the longer mane and the stunningly feminine figure. Those half-lidded eyes are starting to make me a little nervous, but she seems friendly enough. Perhaps too friendly, she's even twirling her hair around her finger.\n\n\"Hey sis.\" Reed interjects, literally stepping between me and the counter. He slides the milk crate over, slapping the rim. \"Just some junk parts from out back. What do you think, twenty bucks?\"\n\n\"That's big sis to you.\" Reeda smirks, looking over the crate and rummaging through the pile. She takes a closer look at some of the larger parts, tossing them back into the crate. \"Yeah, twenty sounds about right. Let me guess, tell Dad to take it out of this week's pay?\"\n\n \"Five minutes doesn't make you my 'big sis' Reeda.\" Reed retorts, pulling out his wallet. He flips through some tattered bills, counting them over a couple times, before putting the wallet back in his pocket with a sigh. \"Yeah, tell Dad to just take off my next check.\"\n\n\"No problem.\" Reeda rolls her eyes, punching something into the old register and slamming the drawer back shut. Reed grabs the crate and heads off immediately, and after an awkward pause I follow him back into the storage room.\n\n\"See you at home Reed!\" Reeda calls after him as Reed shoulders the back door open. We step out into the cool evening air, the sun already dipping far lower than I expected. Reed wrenches the back car door open and pushes the crate inside, shoving old soda cans and an amplifier out of the way. I pry my own door open and climb inside as Reed drops into the driver's seat. Reed fishes out his keys and sticks them in the ignition but stops, one hand still on the steering wheel. \n\nHe turns to look at me, his expression cold and serious. That far-off disinterested look in his eyes is gone, replaced by an interrogating intensity. I swallow down a lump in my throat, staring back at him. Somehow, I can't bring myself to look away, no matter how much I want to.\n\n\"So, Anon.\" Reed begins, staring into my very soul, \"What do you think of my sister?\"\n\nMy mouth feels like it's made of leather, and I nervously swallow again. I can tell giving Reed the wrong answer here will bring terrible consequences. Is he the overprotective brother type? Is that why I never heard anything about Reeda before? Should I answer honestly, tell him I'm not interested? I had only recently come to terms with my feelings for Fang, and that took some work. I'm not going to jump at his sister after just one meeting. I can't just blow her off though, she's still family. I'm going to have to walk a fine line here.\n\n\"She seems...friendly?\" I reply, instantly regretting my choice of words. Oh god, that can be construed in all the wrong ways. I can see Reed's eyes narrow, the leather steering wheel creaking under his grip. Backpedal Anon, backpedal!\n\n\"I just mean, she looks laid back. Chill.\" I hastily continue, instinctively leaning toward the door, \"I definitely see the family resemblance. Twins, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, twins.\" Reed finally turns the ignition, reversing out of the parking spot and skidding across the asphalt lot. He stops an the curb, turning to face me one more time. \"So, are you going to ask if she's single?\"\n\n\"No..?\" I awkwardly answer, \"Why would I?\"\n\nReed shrugs, bouncing over the sidewalk and peeling out into the street. I push myself off the door again and settle back into my seat, bracing my feet against floor. Reed turns on the abused stereo while I crank down the window, letting the salty seaside air blow through the cab as we head back up into the bluffs.\n\n\nThe sun has nearly set by the time we swerve back into the Volcano High parking lot. We had made a slight detour to grab some greasy fast food along the way, the soggy paper sacks bunched up between my feet. Reed grabs the milk crate while I gather up the food, sneaking a couple fries from Trish's bag. Luckily the basement door is still unlocked, possibly for whatever sports teams are still practicing this late. The building has a strangely eerie feel to it with all the lights off, your footsteps echoing down the deserted hallway. At least there's still some light spilling out from behind the shop classroom door.\n\nAs Reed and I push the door open and head in, I spot Trish and Fang at the table right where we had left them. Trish and Fang are watching something intently on Trish's phone, laughing and talking animatedly. I can hear rock music coming from the speakers as Fang looks up, quickly turning off the phone. Her eyes dart to the darkening sky out the widow and back to me, her smile turning forced and guilty.\n\n\"Hey guys. Get anything good?\" She asks, eyeing the box of scrap parts Reed drops on the table. I cross my arms, pointedly looking at the backpack lying right where Fang had tossed it hours ago. I don't see any notes, textbooks, or even a pencil. Fang at least has the decency to look sheepish, Trish just seems indignant and put-off.\n\n\"Yeah, so uh...\" Fang trails off, scratching the back of her head, \"Trish and I decided to take a quick break after you left, and I guess we accidentally got a little distracted...\"\n\nYeah right, I'd bet my last dollar Trish knew exactly what she was doing. I roll my eyes, tossing Fang and Trish each a bag of cheap fast food. I hand the last bag to Reed, who also seems content to glare in silent judgement at the two girls. Even he must know the indignity of working for hours just to find your 'partners' goofing off.\n\n\"Oh just relax you two.\" Trish scoffs, biting into her veggie burger, \"Fang's still got plenty of time. Besides, we were doing important band research.\"\n\n\"Alright, if you say so Trish.\" Reed sighs, grabbing his thermos and popping off the lid. \"It's no biggie.\" I try to mask my disappointment the best I can as he takes a deep swig. I can't believe Reed just rolled over that easily! Surely he knows how important this project is to Fang, the whole band is at stake after all. How am I more invested in this than he is?\n\n\"Hey Anon, look. I'm sorry, okay?\" Fang apologizes, clearing noticing how I really feel, \"I know you don't have to help me with this. I'll stay focused from now on, alright?\"\n\n\"You better.\" I retort, fishing out my own burger and taking a seat, \"If you don't, I'll stop letting you crib off my science homework every morning.\"\n\n\"You hardass.\" Fang smiles, leaning over to steal some of my fries. I slap her hand away, turning to ignore her theatrical pouting.\n\n\"How about this?\" Fang continues between bites, \"While Reed shows me how to use that soldering iron, could you and Trish pick up some books from the library for me?\"\n\n\"Oh c'mon, why can't he get them himself?\" Trish instantly complains, glaring at me as if this was somehow my idea. \"I can still help out here.\"\n\n\"You're just going to be looking over my shoulder the whole time.\" Fang insists, \"I think you'll survive ten minutes alone with Anon.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but he won't...\" Trish angrily grumbles, taking another bite of her burger. I know she meant for me to hear that. I'm not looking forward to this either, but now I can't back out or I'm the coward. Part of me wonders if Fang is intentionally getting Trish out of here, knowing she's going to be a distraction.\n\n\"Alright fine,\" Trish concedes, balling up her wrapper and tossing it into the trash, \"Lets get this over with monkey boy.\"\n\n\"After you, horn-head.\" I reply, standing up. Trish mumbles something vaguely threatening and stomps off and I leisurely follow after her, leaving Reed to whatever technical lessons he plans on giving. Trish and I head upstairs to the main level. The library is adjoined to the central hub of the school, right in the center of the building. The lights are all off inside, and unsurprisingly the door refuses to budge when I pull it.\n\n\"It's locked, dumbass.\" Trish states the obvious, shouldering me out of the way. She pulls out her school I.D., sliding between the doors. After a bit of fidgeting and a satisfying click she pulls the doors open, looking smug.\n\n\"I could have done that...\" I mutter, edging past her and walking inside. The hallways seemed creepy earlier, but the deserted library is way worse. Between the ominous dark aisles and eerie silence, this is the perfect setting for a cheesy slasher fic.\n\n\"So, what are we looking for exactly?\" Trish asks as we both pull out our phones, using the screens as makeshift flashlights. She already sounds bored with this, and probably would have gone back already if I wasn't here.\n\n\"I don't know, something to help with the essay.\" I answer, scanning the label on the nearest aisle, \"Maybe a textbook on electronics, or soundwaves, anything really.\"\n\nThe two of us work our way up and down the shelves of books, reading the spines by the light of our phones. The room seems so much larger in the dark, the carpeted floor muffling any echoes or noise. The silence is oppressive, made all the worse by the simmering animosity between Trish and I. Normally I would have just asked the librarian where to look, but obviously that isn't an option. Although, that thought does bring up an important detail.\n\n\"Crap, how are we supposed to check these out?\" I ask, pulling an old electronics textbook off the shelf. I honestly don't know if it will be much help, but I feel like I need to start with something.\n\n\"Just take them, who cares?\" Trish shrugs, looking over a cover and shoving it back into place, \"We'll bring them back eventually anyway.\" At first I want to object, but once I think about it she's probably right. It's not like anyone will know we were in here, and we're going to return the books eventually anyway. At worst, we'd just cause the librarian some confusion. It's not like many students even use this place anyway.\n\nSlowly, the stack of books in my arms grows taller as the minutes pass by. I'm honestly not sure if even half of these will really be helpful, but I feel like I need to at least grab something. Trish doesn't seem to share that sentiment. She's yet to pick out anything, rejecting book after book with visibly growing frustration.\n\n\"This is such a waste of time.\" Trish grumbles, slamming another book back onto the shelf, her tail swinging angrily behind her. \n\n\"Why not go check the music section?\" I reply, firmly aware she meant more than just this book search.\n\n\"You know what I mean, skinnie.\" Trish snaps back, not even bothering to lace the insult with a fa\u00e7ade of friendliness. \"Fang doesn't need this stupid project, she needs to keep practicing. Why are you even here?\"\n\n\"Fang asked me for help.\" I answer as frustratingly literal as possible. I'm not sure where Trish's deep seated animosity comes from, but it's definitely easy to piss her off. I can practically hear her teeth grating from here.\n\n\"She doesn't need your help.\" Trish retorts, turning to glare at me. Even with the faint light, I can see her fists balled at her sides as she stares me down.\n\n\"Does she need yours?\" I ask, the words popping out of my mouth before I can think. I don't know where that came from, but it seems to have worked. Trish rocks back, stunned out of her anger. Several emotions flash across her face; shock, outrage, shame, then finally indignation. Her mouth gapes like a fish as she tries and fails to formulate a response, finally storming off without a word.\n\nI let her go, turning back to searching the shelves. I won't give her the satisfaction of chasing after her, and it gives me time to bask in my triumph. It's rare that I render Trish completely speechless after our verbal spats, and I want to savor the moment. Truthfully, I intended to call it quits and head back soon anyway, but I'll let Trish stew for a couple minutes longer.\n\nOnce I figure she's had enough time to simmer down, I head off to look for Trish. It's not hard to spot the glow of her phone in the dark, all the way over at the far end of the library. She stands up as I walk towards her, a couple thin books held in her arms. Without a word she shoves them onto my pile, shouldering past me and heading back into the hallway. Grabbing the top book, I can just barely read cover; 'The Science of Electrical Instruments'. Huh, how about that.\n\nAfter Trish and I drop off the books we collected with Fang, the whole group spent the next several hours helping Fang out with her project. Reed continues teaching Fang the finer point of soldering iron etiquette, Fang only managing to singe her feathers once. Trish and I pour through the textbooks, earmarking chapters that look at least hallways relevant to the project. As I suspected, most of what I had picked out is nearly useless, but the couple Trish found turn out to be perfect sources. We don't go so far as to read through everything entirely or start taking notes, this is supposed to be Fang's project after all.\n\nEventually I'm forced to call it quits. Walking home through Skin Row is dangerous enough as it is, but if it gets any later it will be just plain stupid. Everyone else takes the opportunity to head home themselves, gathering up their things and waving goodbye. I grab the books we didn't end up using, deciding I might as well return them tonight.\n\nAfter I nearly fill the book return slot, I head back through to pitch black halls to the front door. There was barely enough light to see earlier, but now I'm forced to use my phone as a flashlight again. This place really is perfect for some kind of shitty Doom wad, or a low budget horror flick. There's got to be some kind of school film club, they've probably already made one. As I pass the cafeteria however, something catches my eye. It looks like there a light on inside, and I can just barely hear some kind of strange noise.\n\nI should just go home before it gets any later, but I can't help but be curious. Who the heck would be in the cafeteria this late at night? I step inside, noticing the light is actually coming from behind the kitchen door. I should just pretend I didn't see anything, put this out of my mind, but I'm compelled to look. This is how the first guy dies in every horror movie, I know that. I'll just take a quick peek and get out of here.\n\nI gently push the door open, craning my neck to look around the corner. The light is coming from a large battered microwave, a cup of instant noodles slowly turning inside. Standing in front of it is none other than Mr Delewski, wearing nothing but some boxers and a tattered tank-top. He's air-drumming, waving his arms and bobbing his head as he loudly hums some horrendously mangled beat. Oh sweet Raptor Jesus, that fat bastard really does live here. I should turn around and get out of here before he notices, but I can't look away. I'm captured by morbid curiosity, like a driver passing a horrible car wreck on the highway.\n\nMr. Delewski stops, some instinctive part of his brain warning him that's he's being watched. With mounting horror I watch as he slowly turns, looking me straight in the eye. We stare at each other without a word, the room silent except for the gentle hum of the microwave. An unspoken understanding passes between us, the way it only can between two men who precisely understand each other. Nobody moves as the microwave beeps, the timer finally finished counting down.\n\n\"You, uh...\" Delewski begins, breaking the silence, \"You won't tell noone about this, will ya?\"\n\n\"Bump my grade up to a 'C', and we're good.\" I reply, impulsively deciding to take my chance.\n\n\"You're a good man Anon.\" Mr Delewski nods as I slowly back out of the doorway, \"You's a good man.\"\n\n\n\nFang works tirelessly as the week drags on, staying up well into the night. She nods off constantly, jolting awake every time I nudge her desk when a teacher looks her way. During lunch she either has her face buried in a book, or is talking Reed's ears off with questions. Trish continues to stew in her frustration, but at least she doesn't try to badger Fang about the project anymore. Not that she can do much about it anyway, Ripley was true to his word. Fang is banned from band practice unless she gets a passing grade, her guitar locked up tight and out of her reach.\n\nI want to help out, to ease the burden off her shoulders, but I hold myself back. Besides the fact that this is supposed to be an individual project, it's refreshing to see her so invested in something. Somewhere along the line, this endeavor switched from being an obligation to becoming a passion. Fang's eyes are alive as they pour over wiring schematics and soldering instructions. I can see her lost in thought during class, quietly mumbling to herself as she twirls a pencil around her fingers. She's doing this now because she wants to see if she can, to see what she's capable of. I can't compromise that.\n\nAfter a nice long weekend of sleeping in, trolling forums, and playing xrox, it's time for school again. Yawning as I walk up the front steps, I meet Fang and the gang at the school doors. Fang has her familar guitar case with her again, but I know it must contain her pet project. It's pretty adorable how protective she is of it, holding it tight as she warily looks out for anything that could threaten it.\n\n\"Hey Fang, you got it done?\" I point to the guitar case, asking more as a formality than anything else.\n\n\"Yeah, I think so.\" Fang drums her fingers across the case, looking apprehensive. \"It was working okay last night when I checked it. It should still be fine, as long as nothing bumped lose on the ride over here. I could pop the case open and check before class-\"\n\n\"Fang, you gotta chill.\" Reed drapes an arm over Fang's shoulder, leaning into her and nearly pushing her over. Fang rolls her eyes and squirms free, shoving Reed away as he grins. \"It'll be fine. I checked over everything with you yesterday, remember? You're good to go girl.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know.\" Fang sighs, soothing her nerves. The group splits up as we head to our lockers, Fang and I heading down the same hallway. I can see her wings still are uncomfortably tensed. She must really be nervous about this. It's not hard to guess why, she really poured her all into this project. If Dr. Fernsworth tears it apart right in front of her, that would be devastating.\n\n\"Hey, Anon?\" Fang tugs on my sleeve as I head off to class. She tries to look aloof, but I can tell she's apprehensive about something. \"You mind coming with me to the presentation? I need somebody to help carry Reed's amp.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure.\" I agree, seeing right through her act. She could have easily asked Reed earlier if she only needed a tech jockey. We fistbump and part ways, heading off to our first classes for the day.\n\n\n\nThe time to submit the projects is during lunch break, so rather than go to the cafeteria I head outside to the parking lot. Reed tossed me his keys earlier in the day so I could grab an old amplifier out of the trunk for the presentation. After prying the mangled hood open and making sure the possum isn't inside, I grab the handheld amp and head back to Fernsworth's classroom. The amp looks like something straight out of the 80s, sided with fake wood paneling and a crosshatch speaker cover. It's probably another one of Reed's restoration projects.\n\nStepping into Fernsworth's classroom, it looks like about five other students besides Fang took up Fernsworth's offer for extra credit. Everyone looks nervous, suddenly anxious their work won't be up to his stringent standards. One student appears to have built some kind of electrical device, probably a radio if I had to guess. Another built some kind of model airplane, it doesn't look like it came from a kit at least. A very bored looking stegosaur is seriously submitting a model solar system that belongs better at a first grade science fair. That poor soul.\n\nFang is leaning against the back wall with her guitar case, waving me over. Dropping the amp next to Fang's feet, I take up position beside her against the wall. Fang gives me a small \"Sup?\" in greeting, crossing her arms over her stomach. I match her posture, mimicking all her little mannerisms and actions as we wait, trying not to smirk. Fang catches on eventually, elbowing me in the side as she snickers.\n\n\"Alright, settle down everyone.\" Dr. Fernsworth unnecessarily announces as he walks in, it's not like anyone is really talking. He shuffles over to his desk, adjusting his comically thick glasses as he takes a seat. \"Now then, who would like to go first?\" Nobody volunteers, everyone warily eyeing the room hoping someone else will go first. \n\n\"Well let's just go in alphabetical order then.\" Fernsworth looks over the group, stopping on Fang and I in the back. \"Fang, why don't you go first then?\"\n\n\"Fine.\" Fang stand up, grabbing her guitar case. She marches confidently to Fernsworth's desk and unlatches the case, pulling out her homemade guitar. I follow her up, standing to the side of the room where I can still get a good view. It's the first time I've ever seen Fang's guitar, and I wasn't sure what to expect. The whole assembly has a improvised and macgyvered look to it. I recognize the different parts Reed and I scrounged up in the pawn shop, now all assembled into a complete guitar with strangely mismatched colors and materials. It looks sturdy enough, but I can see where Fang made mistakes putting it together; a little too much glue here, a small spiderweb of cracks there.\n\n\"Okay, so... for my project I constructed an electric guitar from spare parts.\" Fang begins, pulling out the essay from her backpack and sliding it over. \"In my paper, I go over how each of the individual components works and how they all come together to make the guitar, um... work.\"\n\nFang flips over the guitar, spinning a few loose screws and removing the back cover to reveal the interior. It's a mess of wires and electrical bits I barely recognize, the whole thing just a tangled rat's nest to me. Fernsworth flips through Fang's essay, glancing between the paper and the guitar as he skims the pages. Fang goes on to explain the internal wiring, the jargon and terminology flying entirely over my head. Fernsworth only hmms and hums as Fang continues, stumbling over her words occasionally. She's normally so confident performing in front of a crowd, but here she's out of her element. As Fang trails off, running out of things to say, Fernsworth finally starts asking questions. Once again, I'm stumped as to what he's talking about, but I can tell he knows what to ask. He probably already has the answers, but he's really testing Fang to see if she did the research herself. Fang is holding her own so far, but I can tell her nerves are fraying.\n\n\"Alright then Fang, just two more questions.\" Fernsworth adjusts his glasses, \"First, did Anon help you with this project?\" Fang hesitates, internally weighing her options. If she admits that not just I, but Trish and Reed all helped out on this project Fernsworth might just reject it outright. On the other hand, she can't just deny it entirely. Tagging along with Fang today may have been a mistake, I've already essentially admitted my involvement. Anything I could say would only undermine her, so I'm forced to keep my mouth shut and wait for Fang's answer.\n\n\"Yeah, Anon helped out a bit.\" Fang confesses, her tone growing defensive, \"Just at the start though, I did all of this myself.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I'm sure\" Fernsworth holds his hands up, trying to mollify Fang before she gets going. \" I suppose I never said you couldn't have any help. Second question then, does it work?\"\n\nFang snatches the audio cable from the amp, slotting it into the guitar as she slings the strap over her shoulders. The amp pops and crackles as I plug it into the wall, a low electric hum filling the classroom. The other students are paying more attention now, some of them whispering warnings to each other and scooting away from the speaker. Fang doesn't notice, or at least she doesn't care. Fang was nervous before with an academic prsentation, but now she's back on her home turf.\n\nHer fingers sweep over the strings, a clear melodic chord singing across the room. The student's whispers are silenced as the notes echo for a few moments, but Fang isn't satisfied yet. Her fingers dance up and down the neck of her guitar as she improvises a melody, simple yet full of emotion. Everything Fang put into this project comes flowing out in her song. Her doubts, her determination, her hopes, I can hear them all. It's not the most elegant melody, but it's hard to disparage her enthusiasm. Fang's song slowly comes to a natural end, her expression relaxed and sincere. She bolts upright as the amp crackles as if she was lost in a trance, unslinging the guitar and returning it to the case.\n\n\"Well Fang, that was very impressive!\" Fernsworth claps, his wrinkled face splitting into an uncharacteristic grin.\n\n\"Good enough for an 'A'?\" Fang asks hopefully, leaning forward and hanging onto his next words.\n\n\"Oh my, no...\" Fernsworth waves dismissively, Fang's face falling in an instant. My heart drops as I stammer out an incoherent protest. Fang has worked so hard for this, and it turned out perfectly! That isn't fair!\n\n\"Although, I don't think a 'B' wouldn't be out of the question.\" Fernsworth continues with a sly smirk, \"Extra credit can only go so far after all.\" Oh, that cocky little bastard. I want to step forward and throttle his gross baggy neck, but Fang pulls me away by the arm before I can act on it. I just barely hear Fernsworth call for the next presentation before Fang drags me out the door, clearly eager to get out of there. Once we're out in the empty hallway Fang throws her arms around my neck with a squeal of delight, her weight nearly sending both of us stumbling down onto the floor. I reflexively wrap my arms around her back for balance, my face burning up as I realize what's happening. We stumble around in an awkward dance as we both try to catch our balance, Fang flapping her wings and laughing all the while. Mercifully she lets me go before I completely embarrass myself, her mood far too good to notice anything amiss.\n\n\"Yes! I did it! I got a 'B'!\" Fang beams, pumping her fists in the air while bouncing from foot to foot. My heart swells seeing her this happy, her smile totally infectious. That late night spent working in the basement was definitely worth it, just to see her this happy.\n\n\"Congratulation champ, I knew you had it in you.\" I tease, laying it on thick. Fang playfully punches me in the shoulder, still giddy with excitement. I point to the guitar case Fang still has slung over her back, \"So, what are you going to do with that?\"\n\nFang swings the case around and opens it, running her fingers over the chipped wood surface inside. Her excitable mood is gone quickly as she falls deep into thought. I don't think she has actually considered what do with it after today, she was probably too wrapped up in making it first. It performed well enough back in the classroom, but even I can tell it's far from the quality of her own guitar, which already has a spare. Fang gently plucks the inert metallic strings, lost in thought.\n\n\"Do you want it?\" She suddenly asks, looking seriously at me. This isn't what I was expecting, the question stuns me. I don't know what to say, she clearly isn't kidding. Fang removes the guitar from it's case, placing it in my upturned hands. I feel the unfamiliar weight in my palms, unsure if I can really accept.\n\n\"I've already got two guitars at home, I don't need a third.\" Fang explains, noticing my reluctance. She lifts the strap up and over my neck, standing back to admire how it looks on me. \"Besides, this way you can practice at home. You're up for more lessons, right dork?\"\n\nMy fingers run up the neck of the guitar, tracing all the little flaws and imperfections. I look over all the mismatched parts, the clashing colors, and the worn-out roughened exterior. It's a perfect fit for me, I'm forced to admit. Fang poured her soul into making this, and now she wants me to have it. I can already tell this is going to be one of my most treasured possessions.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I smile, matching her grin and slinging the guitar over my shoulder, \"That sounds good to me.\"","encoded":false,"Title":"Science Project","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed, Reeda, Carldelewski, Fernsworth and

Your fingers look raw as fuck.\" Fang strums the strings of her guitar one last time before placing it down, resting the neck against her bed. I do the same, minus the strumming as my fingertips are red from the hours of abuse.\n\n\"Wouldn't be like this if you weren't such a slave driver of a teacher. A good one, but still, piss off.\" She lets out a devilish snicker at my back-handed compliment, elbowing in the shoulder lightly. Still exhausted, I let myself fall back into her bed, my brows now furrow in thought as I start thinking.\n\nIt's nice to be able to meet up with Fang again, especially since we hadn't seen each other for a week. A voluntary choice on both of our ends, as we decided it was best to wait out the rest of her estrus before hanging out. As good as the sex was, and as tempting as fucking each others brains out on a daily basis was to the both of us, we decided that her father finding out and caving my bald head in with a nine iron really wasn't worth it.\n\nMy mind attempts to wander back a bit farther, but it's interrupted as I suddenly notice Fang's face looming over mine, a dangerous smirk spread across her beak. \"Well, thinking about it, I wouldn't be a good teacher if I didn't reward my student, so how about I let you do something kinky?\"\n\nI shoot up near instantly, the ptero barely managing to get out of the way in time to prevent us from bumping heads. \"Are you messing with me, or you mean it?\". There's a mix of nervousness and excitement in my voice as I stare her dead in the eyes.\n\n\"Y-Yeah. So uh, you got any ideas?\" The bravado and confidence in her voice just moments before  is suddenly missing. She places a hand in my lap almost expectedly, but I'm already lost in thought as I try to recall something.\n\nEver since our first time, I've been looking for tips to use in the future on my Chinese Cartoon Torrenting Site. A lot of it seemed... Dubious at best, but there's currently one that sticks out in my mind.\n\nI reach out and grab Fang by her shoulders, bringing her closer as I autistically blurt \"I'm going to dominate you.\" Her face goes beat red, and I can feel that she's about to open her mouth to say something. I can't have her doing that though, that'd ruin everything.\n\nI unhinge my jaw and take in the tip of Fang's snoot into my mouth before sliding further down her length. The blush on her cheeks is replaced by an annoyed scowl on her face from this stupid idea, but it soon fades into a once of what I assume is amusement. It's kind of hard to tell with most of her mouth down my throat at the moment.\n\nI give an experimental suck, which gets a giggle out of her, and I instantly figure out the problem with this arrangement. If she moves her mouth, it pushes against my teeth and jaws, and that actually really hurts. But if I stop now, I'm just going to look like an idiot, so fuck that. I continue sucking and sliding my mouth up and down her beak, getting more giggles and more pushing against my jaw for my trouble. There's a smug look in her eyes, and now I know she's doing this on purpose.\n\nThat's it, I'm not going to be mocked any longer. I'm going to show this beautiful ptero bitch that I'm an alpha caveman. Pulling up my metaphorical britches, I take as much of her snout as I can into my throat and then some, nearly gagging as the only sort of training I've had for this was deepthroating a banana once in middle school. I feel kind of slightly accomplished about how much I'm able to fit in my virgin mouth, but that feeling is short-lived as I feel something warm and slimy wiggle deep into my throat.\n\nI begin to sputter and choke, pushing Fang away and out of my maw as she begins full on laughing, tears rolling down her face as her chest heaves heavily. \"Hahaha holy shit Anon, what the fuck did you think was gonna happen!?\"\n\n\"Did you just fucking shoot a salty surprise down my gullet!? The fuck???\" The coughing has subsided, but I'm still rubbing my throat to try and get rid of the weird sticky feeling. She grins, sticking out her tongue in response, and probably the answer as I finally understand what just violated me.\n\nShe waits for me to fully calm down, before picking up her guitar again, plucking a few of the strings with her claws. \"Anyway, I think that's enough of a reward for now... So what part of the song were we on again?\". Fang pauses, scratching her neck in thought for a bit before remembering.\n\n\"Oh, yeah.

The Trigger.txt"],"text":"Once upon a time,* a ptero and a trigger worked** together in a garden.***\n\n*It was a Saturday\n**We were not paid. We were sentenced to beautification duty for spray painting the school wall with our bands' logo.\n***The pride and joy of a certain Ankylosaur.\n\nWe were there because we had to be there or face Spears' wrath. There was no bargaining or talking your way out of it. If you tried weaseling your way out of it or flat out skipping beautification duty, Spears would make sure you'd regret it. \n\nIn the first hour, the ptero cut the long wines that needed trimming with sharp sheers while the trigger held the ladder, for that was the task that required the least effort.\n\nIn the last hour, the trigger got them both stuck with weeding duty as punishment for munching on some Middlemist Red Camelias leaves.\n\nThe day dragged on to infinity, and the breaks lasted less time than it took to check if there were any new messages. Insects buzzed between the flowers, pollinating the plants and filling the air with the droning of their wings. Clouds were absent from the sky. A tree of silver wings, with mushrooms growing around its trunk and roots, provided some shade. \n\nThe ptero and the trigger passed the time by talking about their band.\n\nThese are the rules of Vvurm Drama.\n\nRule One. Any member can make suggestions about the band's future.\n\nRule Two. Every suggestion is settled with a democratic vote by its members. \n\nRule Three. Having a unique gimmick takes precedence over sounding good.\n\nRule Four. Always think bigger because there's merchandise to sell.\n\nHigh school bands typically challenge students musically more than those in middle school. The music increases in difficulty with more complex passages, intricate rhythms, and more involved phrasing. Selections also vary in style. A well-rounded band is expected to play a wide variety of music, ranging from serious 'program music' to lighter 'pop-style' music. For many high school students, school bands are the main form of music education available to them.\n\nAnd yet the typical high school band is nothing compared to the one where the ptero and the trigger play in. The discordant shredding of two bass guitars creates a cacophony equal to hundreds of cats being ritualistically sacrificed.\n\nThe ptero and the trigger discovered that there were many possible instrument combinations. A problem arose with unconventional band layouts. If the members were anything short of being masterful, the entire thing sounded off. When it comes to music, it either sounds good or doesn't. The ptero knew this, for she had been playing instruments since pre-k.\n\nAnd in time, the ptero became vexed.\n\nIt always ends the same,\" the ptero complained. \"Everyone always jeers.\"\n\n\"What do they know?\" I asked. \"They're just jealous.\"\n\n\"They're right. We sound terrible with two basses,\" the ptero complained. She kneeled to flick a patch of sod with her trowel. It struck an open flower, ruining its petals. The Ankylosaur would yell at them again for ruining her hard work.\n\n\"They're retarded,\" I said. \"When we make it big, everyone will regret making fun of us.\"\n\nWe would all become rock stars and make tons of money selling merchandise. The ptero will finally be happy, and it would be all thanks to me. All we have to do is hold on a while longer, practice a little more. The ptero got up and brushed the dirt off of her torn jeans.\n\n\"Every time we perform, people mock us. You might care about it, but it gets to me every time. I've been playing for most of my life, and what do I have to show for it? No one is going to give us the time of day because of this stupid...gimmick.\"\n\nThe ptero took hold of one of the long feathers with her hand, slowly rubbing it between her palm and thumb.\n\n\"I'm going to do something about it,\" she said. \"We need a new rule.\"\n\nI looked up in shock. I said, \"What? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"A special new rule. Something to...\" The ptero threw up her hands in exasperation. \"I don't know. To not make me feel miserable every time we practice. A veto that helps me not regret dedicating my life towards playing music.\"\n\nThe ptero begins pacing back and forth, \"The human was right. The band is supposed to be fun. I'm not having fun playing the bass just so we can have a dumb gimmick in a vain attempt to sell more merchandise.\"\n\n\"But we voted on it!\" I said, with rising panic|fury in my voice.\n\n\"No, that doesn't count. You can't have a democracy with only three members.\"\n\n\"We're gonna have to rewrite all our songs. If you start playing guitar, we'll be like any other band out there. I'll have to make new designs for the shirts.\"\n\n\"No,\" the ptero said. \"Either I can play the guitar, or I'm quitting the band.\"\n\nAnd thus, Vvurm Drama's layout changed to have the lead singer play the guitar. And I had to allow it for fear of losing my best friend. And I could do nothing but follow my true nature and try to convince the ptero that the human was a bad influence.\n\nI looked at the ptero.\n\nI looked at the phone in my hands.\n\nI discovered the human photoshopped himself kissing an anime girl.","Title":"The Ptero and The Trigger","Status":"","Characters":"Fang, Trish","Rating":"SFW","Author":"F4L","Summary":"The first

Y\u2019know\u2026 together.\u201d\n\n   Anon, soon as he finishes speaking his words, turns his gaze towards Lucy. Lucy, for her part, has her eyes set to the night sky as well, but as the seconds pass by, a dusting of pink crosses her cheeks.\n\n   \u201cI would\u2026 I totally would, Anon\u2026\u201d Lucy answers as she brings her eyes to meet mine. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got work like you wouldn\u2019t believe!\u201d she adds, all the while letting a slight sight escape her lips.\n\n   Anon feels slightly deflated by Lucy\u2019s response. \u201cO-oh. Well, if it\u2019s too much\u2014\u201d \n\n   \u201cHOWEVER!\u201d Lucy interjects, cutting off whatever words Anon was about to say. She then places her hands over Anon\u2019s, all the while her eyes remain fixed on those of the human. \u201cI\u2019ve got time in the morning. So how about breakfast?\u201d\n\n   Anon\u2019s lips rise. \u201cIs that a date then?\u201d he asks cheekily.\n\n   Lucy gives Anon a mischievous little simper. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Is it?\u201d\n\n   \u201cIt is then,\u201d Anon reaffirms to Lucy.\n\n   Lucy lets out a giggle, her cheeks growing ever pinker in the process. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dweeb,\u201d Lucy said as she shuffled closer towards Anon until their legs pressed together.\n\n   \u201cI know,\u201d Anon replied to Lucy as he moved his chest ever closer towards Lucy. Lucy, in turn, leaned her head on Anon\u2019s shoulder, who in turn wrapped his arm around her shoulder.\n\n   \u2018Feels like old times,\u2019 Anon thought as he allowed Lucy\u2019s warmth to fill his being. \u2018Like no time\u2019s passed since I left Volcadera Bluffs.\u2019 He looked up to the sky, his gaze falling on the bright almost full moon. \u2018I guess I never did say goodbye to Volcano High,\u2019 he mused to himself.\n\n   A short snort and a tiny giggle left Lucy\u2019s nose and lips as she turned her eyes back on Anon. \u201cThanks, now my face is forever stuck in a cringe.\u201d\n\n   Anon rolled his eyes. \u201c Way to ruin the moment,\u201d he said, the grin on his lips only growing wider by the second.\n\n   \u201cYou ruined it first with you mumbling,\u201d Fang retorted with a matter-of-factly look.\n\n   \u201cFix it then,\u201d Anon riposted.\n\n   \u201cYou ruined it. You fix it,\u201d Fang countered.\n\n   Anon shifted Lucy in his arms and brought her up within inches of his face. \u201cFine. I will,\u201d he said, his hand cupping Lucy\u2019s cheek. Lucy, in turn, softly smiled and leaned in for a well-earned kiss\u2026\n\n \n\n   Anon jolted awake. \n\n   With a groan of pain and a whimper of sorrow, Anon forced himself upright. His body refused to move for a full ten seconds before he forced himself to sit. As he did, he felt wrapped in something he hadn\u2019t felt in what to him felt like decades: warmth and comfort. \n\n   Anon breathed through his mouth. His mind struggled both to process what he had seen in his dream all the while fighting to preserve any memory of it before the cold uncaring oblivion of wakefulness claimed them. \n\n   Anon brought a hand up to his face, wiping away sweat from his face. Except that what he was wiping from his eyes and cheek wasn\u2019t sweat...\n\n   For almost a week now, Anon had been experiencing the dreams. They always started the same, with him relieving the most important days of his high school life. The dreams would then go into wildly different directions than what his life had taken. Regardless of how they played out, all lead him to some happily ever after with Fang and Trish and Naser and Reed and Rosa and Stella. \n\n   For almost a week, Anon had seen events that were far too good for an apathetic caveman like himself. Each dream resulted in happiness and joy for all his old friends\u2026 as well as for himself... \n\n   ...Even though he knew deep down that he didn\u2019t deserve happiness of any kind...\n\n   Anon picked himself up from bed and raced for his fridge. Tossing out old food containers and empty bottles of juice, he found what he had been searching for. Another bottle of high-proof vodka, this one 120. Without equivocation, he chugged down what might as well have been rubbing alcohol. As the liquid traveled down his esophagus, he let out a hiss as the liquid burned his throat. He then walked to his desk and pulled out a blunt of weed from a homemade cigarette pack. Looking down, Anon realized that it was his last roll. With some hesitation\u2014and a trembling hand\u2014he lit a match and set the cigarette alight. A second later, he almost inhaled the whole blunt of weed, holding the smoke in his lungs for almost half a minute before exhaling. Within ten seconds, his mind became abuzz once again with memories of the various dreams he had experienced so far. Memories in which he saw his friends joyfully living lives they deserved. Memories in which he saw Lu\u2014Fang, working a job she loved, following her dreams without compromise, and loving him as deeply as any woman can love a man\u2026\n\n   Anon once again brought his head to his hands, sweat once more pouring from his face and staining his hands, body, and floor. He tried to wipe the sweat away, but the more he rubbed his face, the harder the sweat flowed. \n\n   Anon did his best to try and calm down, but as the minutes ticked by, he began to feel a strange sensation on his being. Little by little, his apartment began feeling far too small and far too hot for him to bear. The memories also returned in full force, sending his mind reeling with confusion and chaos. The memories of a happier home he would never have. Clean walls devoid of cracks and blemishes. Portraits of a happy family without a worry in the world...\n\n   Anon stood on his feet and began glancing around his apartment in a panic. The very walls judged him for his failures. They jeered and laughed and reminded him how much of a real fuck-up he was....\n\n   Anon had to get away; find a place that was wide open, one where he could escape. One where the walls couldn't find him in.\n\n   Wasting no time, Anon snuffed his blunt and slipped on his usual drab attire. After sliding on his black turtleneck and putting on the black and worn wool beanie he brought back from his time as a seaman, Anon headed for his apartment's exit. \n\n   Right before he exited his home, Anon took another look at his bottle of vodka near his fridge. With a grimace, he snatches the bottle. Hesitating for a second, he downed another large swig. After yet another hard grunt, he placed the bottle in one of his pant's pockets and stepped into the hallway.\n\n   Already feeling lightheaded, Anon struggled a bit with locking his door. After some fumbling with his keys, he successfully worked the door\u2019s mechanism. \n\n   With that small victory under his belt, Anon took off like a man on a mission. His pace was on the normal side for an ex-navy member. It was practically a jog when compared to the average person out on the street though. Within a matter of only ten minutes, he was more than halfway done with walking a mile.\n\n   As Anon aimlessly moved down the streets of Skin Row,  Anon's booze-addled mind couldn't fathom where his body was going. In the few instances where he had some form of lucidity, he course-corrected. By the time he had exited Skin Row, he was well on his way towards the shore. \n\n   Anon wasn\u2019t sure why his body moved towards the beach. Maybe it was because some part of him actually missed the smell of the ocean. Maybe it was because his body felt hot and he wanted\u2014needed\u2014to cool off. Whatever the case, it seemed like his lizard brain had settled on the course. Gradually, his pace became faster. First a power walk, then a full-on sprint.\n\n   Anon\u2019s legs pushed his body forward at a pace that could have matched Naser during his track and field prime. To any observer, the human looked like some kind of stereotypical robber. With the bottle of vodka in his hand though, he could pass for some kind of Gopnik after hearing the words \u2018free vodka\u2019 echoed in the distance. To further add to his Gopnik appearance, he took a swig of his vodka every few minutes. In his drunkenness, he had confused the bottle in his hand for water. While the human thought he was hydrating, he was in reality only getting drunker... on top of already being high.\n\n   When Anon reached Volcadera Bluffs\u2019 shores, he was well beyond drunk. The world was a spinning swirl in his eyes. What little of the beach he could see mixed together with bitter memories. Memories that were his and memories that he was sure couldn\u2019t be his. In those memories, or hallucinations\u2014Anon couldn't tell anymore\u2014everyone he had once known was happy\u2026 something he was pretty sure he had destroyed with a nuclear bomb.\n\n   In a brief moment of lucidity, Anon took in his surroundings. As he did, what little hold he still had on his sanity began to slip as he realized where his legs had carried him\u2026\n\n   ...The beach where he had fucked everything up... \n\n   The exact same spot, even.\n\n   Anon frantically glanced around, his addled and swirling vision doing him no favors. What his eyes couldn\u2019t rationalize as an image, his brain filled in with repressed memories. Little by little, the past and the present mixed together. He could see Fang\u2019s face of rage and sorrow as clear as if it happened yesterday. He could see her body language as he tore down everything the two had built together. He could feel the two teen's booze-addled minds loosening their lips and removing any and all inhibitors. \n\n   Anon heard himself screaming all the horrible things that night as clear as if they were happening in the present...\n\n   \u201cProbably couldn\u2019t fix you if I tried\u2026\u201d\n\n   Anon felt ill. Like his very innards wanted to become his outwards...\n\n   \u201cYou should be glad I\u2019ve put up with your shit as long as I have!\u201d\n\n   \u2018Please, no more!\u2019 Anon demanded of his brain.\n\n   \u201cI deserve a fuckin\u2019 prize or something!\u201d\n\n   \u2018No. Please. That\u2019s enough!\u2019 Anon pleaded as he fell on his knees, his head feeling like it was getting squeezed by a vice.\n\n   \u201cNot like anyone else would put up with a mentally ill schizo like you!\u201d\n\n   \u2018NO! NO! NOO!\u2019 Anon squirmed out, unsure of if it was a mumble or in his head. In response to his confusion and all the self-loathing he felt in that instant, he began to punch himself in the face like some kind of lunatic.\n\n   \u201cYOU DON\u2019T EVEN MAKE A PASSABLE FAGGOT!!\u201d\n\n   \u201cNOOOOOOO!\u201d Anon shouted as hard as his lungs would allow. His shout echoed in the empty streets behind him, but it carried out well out into the empty ocean and the cold uncaring sky. Sweat once again saturated his face and outfit as his body began to shiver.\n\n   No. Not sweat. Tears. Tears long-suppressed flowed unhindered by any of the human\u2019s many self inhibitions. \n\n   Bitter tears that felt like acid upon his skin.\n\n   Without wasting another second, Anon once more began to beat himself. While doing a poor job of actually doing damage due to the haphazard nature of his blows, they at least served to rattle his mind. Each successful punch brought him closer to the sweet embrace of oblivion. \n\n   When Anon felt that his self-harm was failing to knock him out, he dragged himself towards the nearest hard surface he could spot. In that case, it was what looked like a cement bench. \n\n   With no hesitation left in him, Anon began beating his head against the cold hard concrete. With every strike to his head, he cursed himself for his mistakes; the many, MANY mistakes he had made over the years:\n\n   How he had been so cruel toFang when she had been the only person to care for his sorry ass.\n\n   How he had been the catalyst for Fang cutting ties with all her old friends and family.\n\n   How he had never bothered to bury the hatchet with Trish, which resulted in Fang falling out with her.\n\n   How he hadn\u2019t bothered to apologize\u2014or even care\u2014about Fang after their fight.\n\n   How he had cut himself off from the world like some cowards.\n\n   How he had run away from his mistake like a little bitch.\n\n   How he had grown cold and detached from the world at large, to the point that he stopped caring about living.\n\n   How he had again failed to do the right thing and apologized to Fang in that restaurant.\n\n   How he had let his apathy once again ruin his chance at starting the healing process between himself and Fang.\n\n   How he had tried to drink and smoke the dreams away instead of manning up and accepting the message they were trying to tell him...\n\n   By the time Anon hit his head one final time, he could feel his awareness slipping from away. But right before the last of his consciousness left him, he raised a hand up towards the night sky.\n\n   \u201cFuck\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019m not a religious man\u2026 b-but Raptor Jesus\u2026 if\u2026 if you are f-fucking hearing my w-words\u2026\u201d \n\n   Anon\u2019s eyes once more welled with tears, what little vision he had becoming distorted by the veritable dam. \n\n   \u201cPlease\u2026 I\u2019m s-so... so... fucking...sorry\u2026 for my f-fuck ups!\u201d \n\n   Anon took a deep breath and steeled himself for words that he never thought he would say out loud\u2026\n\n   \u201cPlease! G-give me... ano-another... chance! L-let me\u2026 l-let me set this f-fucking mess right! F-for their sakes a-and\u2026 not m-mine\u2026\u201d \n\n   Anon again breathed soft, his vision becoming consumed by the dawning embrace of unconsciousness. \n\n   \u201cP-please\u2026\u201d Anon whispered one final time before the last bit of his consciousness left him. \n\n   \"P-plea...\"\n\n   \"...\"\n\n   Anon\u2019s body went as still as a corpse...\n\n \n\n   It was five in the morning. At least, that\u2019s what the clock on the car\u2019s dashboard said. \n\n   A lime-toned stegosaur rode on the passenger seat of a fairly modern van. She let out a tired yawn as she sunk her body deeper into the car seat. \u2018I guess I shouldn\u2019t have stayed up all night rewatching Gurren Lagann,\u2019 she mused with a mixture of self-scolding and pride. \u2018Ten hours well spent though.\u2019\n\n   Despite her drowsiness from awakening ten minutes earlier, the steg scanned the city vista with interest. As the building whizzed by, her mind projected a small running dino parkouring in pace with the van\u2019s speed. It made her giggle to herself. \n\n   Stella knew it was juvenile to rely on a children\u2019s trick to keep her boredom in check. She had never been one to follow 'standard' growing conventions though. In her eyes, it worked both to keep her entertained and awake. If it worked, it worked. Besides, the world already saw her as a cheerful weeb. It was an outlook that had been with her since elementary school. It was also an outlook she had no qualms in keeping. Short of an apocalyptic event taking society back to the Stone Age, she would stay a weeb until her dying days.\n\n   A cheeky smile formed on Stella\u2019s lips as she thought about what kind of funeral a weeb like her should have. There were plenty of themes she could pick. It had to be something she enjoyed, otherwise, what was the point? She first thought about Neon Genesis Evangelion. 'I mean, that can work,' she mused. NGE was the first anime she ever watched. An uncle had introduced her to it, and on seeing the first few episodes, it had been like love at first sight. From there, NGE served as her gateway to the world of mecha anime, which in turn served as her gateway to anime in general. She started with all the classics like the early Gundams, Macross, and Armored Trooper Votoms. From there, she moved to stuff like The Visions of Escaflowne, King of the Braves Gaogaigar, and Gunbuster. She then got into more contemporary stuff like the Big O and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Gurren Lagann and its celebration of mecha through the years\u2014as well as its sheer galactic scope\u2014made it her absolute favorite anime of all time. \n\n   So with TTGL being Stella's absolute fave, it only made sense that her funeral should be TTGL themed. She pondered for a bit how that would work out though. After about ten seconds of thinking, she decided that it was a topic best saved for somewhere other than a car ride. After all, she had years to plan it out. 'Besides, it's the music that sets the mood,' she told herself with a bit too much excitement. 'When I go, I'm going to have Libera Me from Hell playing on repeat for at least twenty-four hours. If they refuse, then I'm not going to my funeral.' \n\n   With her happy thoughts all but settled for the time being Stella closed her eyes for a few seconds. She had been using her eyes for hours after all, and it wasn't like she was going to fall asleep that easily.\n\n   A few seconds of silence passed by; time in which Stella felt quite relaxed and quite at peace with the world...\n\n   \u201cHey! \u00a1Despiertate!\u201d the voice of the van\u2019s driver, an orange ankylosaur, snapped Stella out from her trance-like state.\n\n   \u201cI-I\u2019m awake!\u201d Stella yelled reflexively. She blinked the haze out of her eyes and looked at her surroundings. Upon ascertaining that she was not in any danger, she snapped her sight towards her combined boss, business partner, and best friend. \u201cWha\u2014wha\u2019s happenin', Rosa?\"\n\n   Rosa let out an amiable chuckle in response to her friend's physical reaction. \u201cAh, \u00a1Disculpame! I was only making sure you didn\u2019t fall asleep on me before we got started on our cardio!\u201d she exclaimed. \"We're two minutes away, so I don't want you sleeping on me!\" the ankylosaur cheered as she turned the steering wheel left before accelerating.\n\n   \"But Rosa! I was getting comfy!\" \n\n   Rosa once again laughed. \u201cMaybe you wouldn\u2019t be such a dormilona if you hadn't stayed up so late watching anime.\"\n\n   Stella crossed her arms and puffed her cheeks. \u201cOh come on. You know well that when I get into a show, I can\u2019t just stop watching it!\u201d\n\n   Rosa let out a single laugh in response to Stella\u2019s statement. \u201c\u00a1Que bichita todavia eres!\u201d She said in her native Spanish before reaching out and rubbing the stego on the head, being careful not to ruffle her green hair too much. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything against you enjoying your anime. Just the anime getting in the way of your sleeping hours.\u201d The orange dino's face turned stern as soon as she finished her words. \"Can't have one of my employees tired at work. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! That\u2019s when I gotta put my foot down!\u201d Almost as if to augment her point, she hit the brakes a little harder than usual. As a result, the van came to a halt with a small jerk, causing Stella to lunge forward in her seat a bit.\n\n   Stella, cheeks still puffed in annoyance, thought of something to say to Rosa. \u2018You\u2019re one to talk, what with how you obsess over your telenovelas!\u2019 The sentence constituted in her brain, words taking shape at the tip of her tongue. She wanted to say it to Rosa too\u2026 \n\n   But the more thought Stella gave it, the more she decided against saying anything. In the end, she deflated her cheeks and only nodded in acknowledgment.\n\n   \"\u00a1Perfecto!\" Rosa cheered as she started to better park her van.\n\n   'Yeah,' Stella thought as she tried to put their interaction in the back of her mind. Deep down, she knew Rosa was only looking out for her wellbeing. It had been that way for the last four years, ever since her own parents more or less washed their hands of her. In their own words, Stella turned out to be an *'anime-obsessed, mystic bull believing, socially stunted excuse for a daughter.'* and pretty much kicked her to the curb. And what had brought about such a hostile exile? Her dream of moving to Japan to become an anime voice actress while also taking up divination and fortune-telling. Sure, accomplishing either goal was a long shot... and she didn\u2019t really have a plan to make any money in the meantime... but she was still determined to see that dream become real! \n\n   'Then again, I don't exactly have the best type of voice for an acting gig... nor do I really speak Japanese fluently despite watching thousands of hours of anime...'\n\n   So her voice acting dreams needed work. She was still amazing at Tarot readings! From her own admittedly biased record-keeping, she had yet to make a wrong prediction.\n\n   'Then again, I haven't exactly been able to practice my fortunetelling much in the last four years. Most people on the streets aren't exactly open to some stranger telling them about their futures. Not to mention...'\n\n   Stella's stomach suddenly felt like she had swallowed a cup full of ice. Her thoughts rewound to that one awful night. The night she made a huge mistake. The night that, with hindsight in its full and terrible might, she committed the single biggest mistake of her life. The night she gave that fateful fortune reading and failed to prevent a terrible fate from coming into fruition...\n\n   ...All because she failed to explain what one single card meant to the one person who needed it most...\n\n   Stella\u2019s heart sank as she remembered the moment in Pizza Moe\u2019s like it was yesterday...\n\n \n\n   \u201cI wanted to ask, what did you think of your fortune?\u201d\n\n   \u201cUh\u2026 I kinda forgot\u201d\n\n   \u201cYou got the Judgement, right?\u201d\n\n   \u201cDoesn\u2019t Ring a bell.\u201d\n\n   \u201cO-oh. Well\u2026 uh\u2026 How would you like another?\u201d\n\n   \u201cEh\u2026 I got time to kill. Sure.\u201d\n\n   \u201cAlright. Take one.\u201d\n\n   \u201cOh my\u2026 Inverted Empress. You... need to be wary about future negligence, Anon...\u201d\n\n   \u201cWhat the fuck does that mean?\u201d\n\n   \"Uh\u2026 er\u2026 Gottago,naturecalls,seeyouattheshow!\u201d\n\n \n\n   As the conversation played out in her memory, Stella had to ask herself why. Why had she rushed out from that situation despite Anon asking for clarification? Had it been her shyness overpowering her desire to help out Anon? Her lack of social skills in the face of such an important development in Anon\u2019s life? Or some misguided belief that Anon had to face his destiny alone despite needing help in walking the right path?\n\n   Stella didn't want to know the answers anymore. The answers wouldn't change the event that transpired that night, nor the aftermath. \n\n   Friendships died. People\u2019s lives abruptly changed. Joy turned to sorrow, and the world moved on regardless of who cried about it. \n\n   Stella\u2014for as naive and childish as some may have called her for it\u2014desperately wanted to believe that there was some other timeline in which everything turned out alright. \n\n   A timeline where she got her stuff together and made something of herself. \n\n   A timeline where all her friends stuck by with each other and helped each other grow to ever-higher heights. \n\n   A timeline where Anon and Fang stayed and had a happy life together...\n\n   \u201cHey. \u00a1Bicha!\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice snapped Stalla back to reality. \u201cWe\u2019re here! And look, we made it before sunrise! That'll give us plenty of time to do our cardio and\u2014\u201d Rosa paused in her tracks, her expression losing some of its cheer. \u201cAre you okay? You look sad. REALLY sad.\u201d the orange dino leaned closer to her friend\u2019s face. \u201cAre you teary-eyed?\u201d\n\n   Stella blinked a few times before running the back of her hand past her eyes. Sure enough, as she withdrew her hand, she noticed a few droplets of water glistening.\n\n   Stella took a deep breath and buried her previous thoughts. \u201cOh, this! I, uh\u2026 I was just remembering this\u2026 super ultra-emotional scene in an anime. Yeah!\u201d She once more put on a broad smile and widened her eyes. \u201cIt\u2026 it was this, uh, v-visual novel adaptation! Yeah. Two former lovers, torn apart by bad decisions and their own inability to let love reach their hearts, finally realize what they mean to each other and race back towards each other\u2019s arms as the music swells and the sakura leaves fall and it\u2019s super, ultra heartwarming and it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Stella brought the fingertips of her right hand up to her lips and, pinching all her digits together, kissed them, and dramatically tossed the metaphorical kiss away from her face. \u201cSo cathartic and perfect that it still brings tears to my eyes!\u201d\n\n   With a deadpan look on her face, Rosa raised an eyebrow. Stella, in turn, only kept a toothy smile on her lips. A few droplets of sweat formed on her brow as she struggled to keep smiling despite her mood being in no such disposition.  \n\n   Two seconds later, Rosa also put on a warm smile on her lips. \u201c\u00a1Hey! Mientras te haga feliz, \u00a1yo soy feliz!\u201d she cheered, turning away from her friend and undoing her seatbelt. \n\n   Stella let out a sigh. \u2018Sorry for the lie, Rosa, but I don\u2019t think remembering the past would be a good way to start your morning,\" She thought, all the while doing her best to keep the forced smile on her lips. \"You have enough to worry as is with the business and stuff.\u2019 She looked down at the spot on the back of her hand where the now dry tears had been. \u2018Besides, I'm being too sentimental about the past. Not like being sentimental's going to change anything about it...\u2019\n\n   A part of Stella wished it could do. \n\nRosa shut off her van\u2019s engine and turned to face her friend. \u201cLista?\u201d she asked in an enthusiastic tone.\n\n     The lime-toned dino hesitated for a second. Her previous thoughts still lingered in the forefront of her mind. It made pumping the brakes on her train of thoughts harder. Rather than risk some mental derailment, she redirected her perception towards thinking of the day yet to come.\n\n   Stella gave her friend a toothy grin. \u201c\u2018Course!\u201d she answered as she unbuckled her seatbelt and stepped out of the van. Rosa followed not long after. The two friends grabbed their water bottles and shut their respective doors. Only when the two were standing out of the van did Rosa press a button on her car\u2019s remote. With a cheerful chirp, the van's doors locked with loud mechanical clicks. \n\n   Stella went over her workout outfit, hoping she hadn\u2019t overdressed like last time. She had gotten her tracksuit on sale one week earlier, and only because it was the same style and color tracksuit that Subaru Natsuki from Re-Zero wore. Re-Zero was the ONLY Isekai show that she actually liked, the rest being hot garbage. She hadn\u2019t bothered to premiere the outfit outside of checking that it fit her well. She almost would have forgotten about it had it not been for Rosa suggesting they go jogging on the beach at dawn. \n\n   A part of Stella wondered why Rosa had decided to do a pre-sunrise jog at the beach. Their workouts at the gym already worked pretty well for them. 'Maybe Rosa wants to try something new?\" Stella pondered as her eyes scanned the still darkened horizon. 'Like some kind of wish that she hadn\u2019t been able to indulge until today?' \n\n   Whatever the case was, Stella was happy that she had a sturdy and warm tracksuit with which to jog that morning. Sure, it was a bit warm for summertime, but it would more than suffice once winter rolled around. \n\n   \u2018I wonder\u2026\u2019 Stella thought as she turned to look at her ass. Sure enough, the pants did her no favors in hiding her wide hips. Hips that only seemed to grow wider with the passing years. \n\n   Stella felt her cheeks warm up a few degrees as she remembered why she hadn\u2019t used the outfit until today. If she wore that outfit in public, she was sure every male eye within a hundred-mile radius would lock on her.\n\n   To try and get her mind off her little dilemma, Stella set her gaze on Rosa\u2019s outfit. \n\n   In some way, Rosa\u2019s workout gear is the polar opposite of Stella\u2019s. Unlike the thick jacket the stegosaur wore, Rosa sported a very light and very red cotton tank top that didn\u2019t even go all the way down to her waist, leaving at least a hand\u2019s worth of open space in which the ankylosaur\u2019s orange belly was visible. Her light gray pants were also on the thin side, being something of a cross between joggers and yoga pants. Unlike Stella\u2019s pants, Rosa\u2019s pants fit her frame so well they neither increased nor decreased the size of her hips. On top of that, the outfit had an intricate set of floral patterns, gray on the shirt, and red on the pants. Stella couldn\u2019t be sure, but something told her that the two garments were matching pieces, even if they didn\u2019t look at them. It made her a bit jealous. It was a really nice ensemble.\n\n   Rosa took a deep breath of air and let out a chuckle. \u201c\u00a1Ah, que gloriosa es esta amanecer!\u201d She inhaled again, only this time wholly through her nose, the smile on her lips only growing wider by the second. \n\n   Stella envied Rosa when it came to her olfactory prowess. She had always had the stronger sense of smell of the two on account of all her years tending to flowers. If what she said was true, botany was an old family tradition dating back at least five generations and two continents. She also didn\u2019t suffer from any pollen problems, like allergies. Likely a perk of her family\u2019s long botanical traditions.\n\n   \u201cBien!\u201d Rosa said as she pulled out her phone and readied her jogging log up. \u201cWe have about an hour before full sunrise. Let\u2019s try and do four miles in that time. Sound good?\u201d\n\n   Stella pulled her own jogging app and also set her goal and pace on it. \u201cOui! C'est parti pour cette course!\u201d she cheered in her native French without hesitation.\n\n   Rosa guffawed at her friend\u2019s use of her family\u2019s native language. Not many knew that Stella's family had come from France. She had been born in Volcadera Bluffs, but she spoke French very well. It reminded the ankylosaur of her own family, and how despite also being born in Volcadera Bluffs, she spoke Spanish almost as well as her native parent.\n\n   Without further words or interruptions from either of them, Rosa and Stella set off jogging. At first, they tried keeping to the paved road snaking along the beach. Soon, they entered the sandy beach itself, their footing becoming uneven in the sand. The extra work needed to maintain balance added to the workout, their combined footfalls muffled by the sand, yet still almost in pace with one another.\n\n   Steadily, the two approached the first big landmark on their journey: a set of concrete benches erected to help beachgoers get some sand-free seating. The benches were plain. Aside from a bit of sun bleaching and some harmless graffiti, they were the definition of mundane.\n\n   That was, except for the black form resting next to the benches. What looked like a body, sprawled out on the sand and almost dead looking...\n\n   Rosa and Stella stopped in their tracks and turned to look at each other. A second of contemplation later, the two anxiously approached the body. Neither of the two girls wanted to say anything, but their growing fear was impossible to deny.\n\n   Rosa is the first to show any emotion other than shock. She lets out a shriek and takes a step away from the body. \u201cS-Stella!\u201d she stammers, her eyes falling on her friend as she points a finger at the body by the benches. \u201cEse h-humano e-esta\u2026 esta\u2026\u201d she takes a deep breath and loses any semblance of composure she had. \u201c\u00a1Esta muerto! \u00a1Esta muerto!\u201d the orange dino screeched all the while frantically running in place. \n\n   Stella froze and swallowed hard. Unlike Rosa\u2019s understandable and warranted freakout, she didn\u2019t panic. At least physically. Even as a part of her brain told her to lose stability and give in to terror, she kept a coolheadedness that betrayed her actual emotions. Years of playing the aloof and mysterious fortune teller may not have helped her make many friends... but it had helped her develop control over her immediate reactions.\n\n   Rosa looked to her friend with concern and fear still etched all over her expression. While still keeping a face full of anxiety, she took some cues from Stella\u2019s calmness\u2014feigned as it might have been\u2014and began calming herself. There was still a sickness in her stomach though. It made her want nothing more than to turn right back around and leave.\n\n   Stella, looking between Rosa and herself, inhaled as much as her lungs would hold and stepped forward.\n\n   On seeing her friend move ahead, Rosa reaches out to Stella and grabs her by the right arm. She says not a word, only shaking her head and giving the lime dino a supplicating gaze.\n\n   Despite her trepidation, Stella eased out of her friend\u2019s grip and stepped closer to the body. As she did, she couldn't help but feel unusual by how calm she felt in the face of literal demise. Perhaps years of dabbling in such occult things as Tarot cards and Ouiji boards had made her apathetic to death? Or maybe all the people back in High School had been right and she was just weird.\n\n   Rosa made a sound behind Stella somewhere between an \u2018eep\u2019 and a whine. Even though she didn't turn around to look, Stella could tell that Rosa had taken a few more steps back in fear. Fear of what, she wasn\u2019t clear on though. \u2018Maybe she thinks this is like the start of a zombie story, like with Highschool of the Dead?\u2019 Stella mused as she continued to approach the body. She of course knew that it was complete nonsense to believe in zombies. Yet, there was always a minuscule chance that she could be wrong. That the instant she got within reach, the body would spring to life and bite her, turning her into a member of the great skeleton army.\n\n   Stella shook her head to get the errant thoughts of zombies out of her head. The only thing that mattered was that there was a body lying on the beach. Neither Rosa nor herself even knew if the human was actually dead. It was hard to tell considering the body was face down.\n\n   The first thing she needed to do was to check.\n\n   The lime stegosaur gingerly closed the remaining distance between herself and the body. Hesitating for only a second, she crouched next to the human and placed her right hand on their back. With one last look back towards Rosa\u2014who still looked like she was ready to take off running at the first sign of danger\u2014she flipped the human face up.\n\n   The first thing Stella's eyes noticed about the human, aside from his gender, were the many bruises and scrapes on his face. As she inspected the human closer, she also spotted a nasty gash on his forehead. The blood was dry, which meant the injury happened hours earlier. Next, she noticed the human's getup. He wore a plain black long sleeve turtleneck and a pair of navy blue jogging pants, as well as a black wool beanie.\n\n   With a bit of doubt given the circumstances, Stella moved her hand towards the human\u2019s chest. At first, she felt neither heartbeat nor lung movement. That changed when a second later, she sensed a very faint heartbeat. She let out a sigh of relief and turned around to face Rosa. \u201cHe\u2019s alive!\u201d\n\n   Rosa, on hearing Stella\u2019s words, exhaled the air she hadn\u2019t even noticed she\u2019d been holding in to for the last minute. After once again collecting herself, the orange dino made a flurry of movements with her right hand. First, she made a cross sign with her index and thumb. Next, she brought up the small cross up to her forehead, then moved to her lower stomach next, and finally both shoulders, starting with her left, and then moving to the right. Finally, she finished by kissing the cross sign and looking up to the heavens with a wide rapturous smile. \u201c\u00a1Oh, gracias Raptor Jes\u00fas!\u201d\n\n   Stella, also feeling relief, decided to take a closer look at the human\u2019s face. She didn\u2019t know many of them, but something about the injured man before her struck her as... familiar. Something about his lack of features that, ironically, made her think of a human she had known years ago... \n\n   \u2018But that can\u2019t be,\u2019 Stella thought as she continued staring into the human\u2019s battered face. \u2018He disappeared almost four years ago\u2026\u2019 \n\n   The lime dino's eyes fell on the human\u2019s beanie. \"There's only one way to find out for sure\u2026\" she whispered as she reached for the human\u2019s beanie. With a single pull, she removed the hat, revealing to the world a shiny bald head, nary a single hair.\n\n   Stella almost tripped backward at the sight. Rosa, noticing her friend\u2019s sudden change in disposition, rushed forward to provide support. She was about to ask her companion what had so shocked her when her eyes too fell upon the human\u2019s face. \n\n   The moment the ankylosaur\u2019s eyes took in the sight of her, she too felt weak on the knees. A strange and powerful mixture of nostalgia and melancholy began coursing through her as the full weight of recognition hit her like a runaway popemobile.\n\n   \u201c\u00a1No lo creo!\u201d Rosa shouted before almost kneeling next to her friend. \u201cS-Stella\u2026 is it... really him!?\u201d she stammered her question.\n\n   Stella looked between her friend and the human a couple more times before the full weight of what she was seeing also sunk in. In the end, there was no other human in town\u2014possibly the world\u2014who had such plain, almost nonexistent features yet had still caused such a large impact on their lives\u2026\n\n   \u201cIt\u2019s Anon...\u201d Stella whispered\n\n   \u201cIt\u2019s An-On!\u201d Rosa shouted.\n\n   Rosa and Stella stayed in shock for a few seconds before Stella broke the silence. \u201cWhat\u2026 what do you think happened to Anon?\u201d she asked, her voice barely holding coherence.\n\n   Rosa looked over the human and grimaced. \u201cLooks like An-On got beat up and got left for muerto.\u201d She lets out a snort, her face twisting into a scowl of rage, her very orange skin turning a deep shade of hot crimson. \u201c\u00a1\u00a1SI ENCUENTRO A LOS PENDEJOS QUE MALMATARON A AN-ON, LO JURO POR RAPTOR JESUS Y DIOS TODO SANTO QUE LES VOY HACER LLOVER FUEGO, FURIA, Y AZUFRE EN SUS CULOS!!\u201d\n\n   Stella swallowed hard again. As a pious follower of the holy cave paintings, Rosa\u2019s whole MO when it came to grievances and affronts to her sensibilities was to turn the other cheek. Her disappointment in you was often more than enough to make even the most hardened offender beg her for forgiveness. To see Rosa be livid enough to threaten fire and brimstone was nothing short of apocalyptic\u2026\n\n   Rosa continued breathing hard for a few more seconds. Each puff of air that left her nostrils was steam. After a minute of barely restrained rage, the dino closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Five seconds of seeming introspective self-calming later, Rosa turned to face Stella. Her expression had shifted from one of rage to one of apprehension. \u201cWe gotta wake An-On,\u201d she proposed to Stella. \n\n   For her part, Stella wholeheartedly agreed with Rosa. The question was, how did they go about rousing a beaten human back into consciousness? What if they did something wrong in the attempt? The idea of causing Anon more harm than he already had suffered wasn\u2019t appealing to either of them. Especially since they hadn\u2019t seen him in nearly four years. Humans could change a lot in that timeframe. Who was to say that Anon had a whole different range of physical functions?\n\n   \u201cUh, Rosa,\u201d Stella started, her hands already withdrawn from Anon\u2019s vicinity. \u201cI think this is beyond us. Maybe we should\u2026 try and get professional help?\u201d\n\n   After a few seconds of contemplation, Rosa let out a sigh and a nod of acceptance. \u201c\u00a1Quedate aqui! I\u2019ll bring the van around and\u2026\u201d she paused, giving Anon another worried glance. \u201c...We\u2019ll drive An-On to the hospital. I\u2019m sure they can help him there...\u201d\n\n   Stella gave Rosa a nod, Rosa taking that as her cue to stand back up and rush back in the direction the two had come in one of her fastest sprints ever. Stella found it a bit surprising to see her friend burn rubber as she was. Then again, the life of an old friend was on the line. If that fact didn\u2019t make someone move faster than they had before, then they weren\u2019t exactly a friend.\n\n   With Rosa gone, Stella looked westward towards the rising sun. She didn\u2019t quite know what to make of the unfolding situation. One thing was certain to her though\u2026\n\n   Anon's entrance into Volcano High and into their lives had once caused everyone\u2019s story to change dramatically. Maybe his return was also a sign that great change was coming? \n\n   Whether that change was good or bad was still anyone's guess\u2026\n\nThe big hand on the clock ticked over to the four. Somewhere in the sterile white hospital room, the sound of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\u2019s main theme, \u2018Sorairo Days,\u2019 snapped Stella awake. The lime stegosaur let out a yawn, stretched the soreness on her neck away, wiped her clear, and looked down at the phone\u2019s screen. A picture of Rosa was glowing back at her. Groggily, she pressed the answer button and placed the phone to her ear. \u201cH-hello.\u201d\n\n   \u201cHey Stella. Como estas?\u201d\n\n   It took Stella a few seconds to translate her friend\u2019s Spanish in her head before answering. \u201cI\u2019m good. Fell asleep though.\u201d\n\n   \u201cI\u2019m guessing An-On\u2019s not woken up yet?\u201d\n\n   Stella turned her eyes towards the bed to her right. Lying there, with an IV bag attached to his arm and wrapped in bandages was Anon wearing a white polka-dotted hospital gown.\n\n   \u201cNo. Still out cold.\u201d\n\n   \u201cDid the doctors tell you anything about what happened\u2026?\u201d There was a pause, though Stella could almost hear Rosa\u2019s hands clench into a white-knuckled fist. \u201c...And who beat him up?\u201d\n\n   Stella thought back to what the doctor had told her\u2026\n\n   *\u201cYour friend there suffered a major concussion, I'm afraid. He also suffered minor fractures on his cheekbones and forehead. We also found shockingly high levels of alcohol and cannabis on his system. I\u2019m shocked he didn\u2019t overdose. Unfortunately, it's still too early to know if all that bad stuff in his system will result in permanent damage\u2026\u201d*\n\n   Stella sighed. \u201cStill no word on who beat Anon up. The only thing the doc told me is that he suffered an... what did he say\u2026 oh, a \u2018major concussion.\u2019 He was also jacked up with so much alcohol and weed that\u2026 well\u2026 he was REALLY jacked up on the stuff. At the same time, too.\u201d\n\n   Stella could hear a gasp from the other end. Her mind played an image of Rosa doing another sign of the cross before her friend spoke again. \u201c\u00a1Santa Madre del Raptor Jes\u00fas! Is he going to die!?\u201d\n\n   Stella sat up straight on hearing her friend\u2019s words. \u201cNo!\u201d she almost shouted before clearing her throat. \u201cI-I mean, Anon\u2019s not dying! He\u2019s stable\u2026 just... really, REALLY hurt....\u201d She thought about the last few words the doctor had told her about Anon\u2019s possible brain health. She considered telling Rosa that last part, but in the end, decided against it. The last thing she wanted was for Rosa to feint from worry.\n\n   \u201cDid the doctor say when An-On\u2019s going to wake up!?\u201d\n\n   \u201cNo. Not really\u2026\u201d\n\n   There was another moment of silence before Rosa once again spoke. \u201cI\u2019m going to close shop early for the day. I\u2019ll be there in three hours.\u201d\n\n   \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Stella asked, the full weight of the events now playing before her sinking in. \u2018Rosa\u2019s never once closed early or taken a vacation\u2026\u2019\n\n   \u201cAn-On needs help, and I doubt anyone else in this town\u2019s going to help him. Especially considering what happened between him and the others.\u201d\n\n   Stella was about to say something, but she only nodded in agreement despite being on the phone.\n\n   \u201cHang in there for a few more hours, Stella. I\u2019ll take over when I get there and you can go get some real rest.\u201d\n\n   \u201cThanks,\u201d Stella said, a warm smile forming on her lips. \n\n   There was a crashing sound from Rosa\u2019s end. What almost sounded like the shattering of a vase. \u201cMaldita sea. Gotta go! A customer\u2019s kid toppled over some flowers and spilled water everywhere. \u00a1Te veo al rato!\u201d Rosa said before shouting something she couldn\u2019t quite catch in her native Spanish. Seconds later, the call dropped. Stella was once more left with a still unconscious Anon by her side.\n\n   Stella put away her phone and stood up to stretch. She had been Sitting for almost nine hours now. Though she hated to admit it, doing nothing but waiting for Anon to do anything other than lay on the bed like a vegetable irked her. Compared to her daily work routine, her current situation couldn\u2019t get any more boring. At the same time, the reason she was even in a hospital was because of Anon\u2019s sudden and violent reappearance. \n\n   As Stella\u2019s eyes fell on Anon\u2019s battered face, the dino couldn\u2019t help but wonder what the human had been up to for the last four years. He, alongside Fang, stopped going to school after prom night. They had ditched prom itself too, which should have been the first red flag for everyone. Talking to Naser had revealed very little aside from the news that Fang had broken up with Anon and had wound up in a bad place. Stella and Rosa believed\u2014or maybe they convinced themselves\u2014that Fang and Anon only needed time to work through the break-up. That they would return to school once they got over the depression. None of them could have known at the time how far-reaching the problem was.\n\n   When a week passed by with Fang still locked in her room, Naser tried taking matters into his own hands. He talked to Trish and Reed. Trish refused to talk about what happened between herself and Fang. Only when she wasn\u2019t around did Reed tell Naser that Fang had broken off her friendship with them. \n\n   With that venue dead, Naser then searched for any trace of Anon. Despite looking for the human high and low, he found no trace of him anywhere. He almost got his father involved at one point. But he realized that doing that would mean setting his very angry father on the person who had hurt his daughter. That would have not been survivable for Anon. \n\n   In the end, Naser gave up and tried to get Fang to return to school\u2026 only to discover that she had run away the night prior. She left no note and nothing to track her with.\n\n   Stella sighed again and plopped back into the couch next to Anon\u2019s bed. As she did, she eyed Anon up and down, taking in all his visible physical aspects in an attempt to piece together some kind of past that would explain the human\u2019s four year absence.\n\n   Stella stared with Anon\u2019s face first. The bandages made it hard to see much skin, but what was visible looked rough. There was a certain tan coloration to it, almost as if Anon had been getting a huge amount of daily sunlight exposure. Going down his neck, she noted a little bit of dryness to his skin. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of the alcohol-induced dehydration, or if it was because of Anon\u2019s last four years somewhere other than Volcaldera Bluffs. Moving to his chest, she noticed that it was far, far bulkier than she recalled in High School. The Anon from High School was scrawny. Not a stick by any means, but certainly lacking in the musculature this Anon had. The arms attached to the chest were also bulked. In some ways, they reminded her of Rosa\u2019s arms, which were naturally heavy thanks to all her garden work.\n\n   Curious and maybe a bit drawn by the muscles on display, Stella inched a finger forward and poked Anon\u2019s right arm. The instant she did, she felt a huge level of resistance, the arms holding almost no flabbiness to them. Stella poked the arm again, this time holding her finger down on the bicep. As she pressed down, she felt the strands of muscle underneath contract, further increasing the arm\u2019s hardness. Having already gone that far, the dino decided to wrap her hand around the human\u2019s bicep. It was then she felt the full level of volume in Anon\u2019s arms. As she withdrew her hand, she couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly warm around the face, her heart racing a bit faster than before. She could hardly believe just how beefed Anon felt. He was almost beefier than the jock she had somehow managed to ask out to prom.\n\n   The discovery of such muscles gave Stella pause. Anon had to have been doing something physically demanding if he had gone from a scrawny guy who could barely pull weeds, to now feeling like he could lift several hundred pounds with one arm. As she inspected Anon\u2019s arm closer, he spotted something that she had somehow missed. She inched closer to get a better look, at which point the shape of an anchor came into her view.\n\n   Stella blinked a few times, unsure of how she had missed such an obvious tattoo. Thinking fast, she reached for her phone and looked online for what an anchor tattoo could mean. Less than two minutes later, she had found a page detailing the exact meanings of sailor tattoos. She only needed to take one look at similar tattoos in the arms of other sailors to put two and two together.\n\n   \u2018The dry, tanned skin, the well-toned muscles, and the anchor tattoo...' Stella shut off her phone and once again sat back down on the couch. As she did, the full weight of her discovery hit her like the fist of one of the Getter Emperor. She again looked to Anon, this time with amazement. Of all the people she had ever met in her time at Volcano High, she had never once imagined Anon as someone to join the Navy. \u2018Though, now that I think about it, it would explain his sudden disappearance...' Stella thought. If she had to take a guess as to what happened after prom... \n\n   \u2018So Fang and Anon break up. The two fall into a deep depression. Anon stops going to school. Probably drops out. Fang also drops out and runs away from home. Anon then joins the navy because he either didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go or wanted to vanish. Spends the next four years on a boat crossing the pacific, hence his tattoo. Got buff and probably did a lot of cool navy stuff. Gets released after his service and comes back to Volcadera Bluffs four years later and then... gets beat up on the beach...?\u2019\n\n   Stella shook her head and started rubbing her chin. \u2018It doesn\u2019t make any sense. None of it does!\u2019 she thought with growing frustration. Anon became a sailor. Sailors were tough. Anon, being a sailor, was tough too. \u2018I mean, the muscles on him are pretty hard to deny,\u2019 she mused, again feeling warm around her cheeks. She changed her mental tracks and returned to her previous ponderings. \u2018Whoever beat him up had to be tougher than he was. Then again, the doctor also said that he was super drunk and super high at the same time. With his senses impaired, it makes a bit more sense that someone would be able to jump him. What would anyone gain from beating up a sailor though?\u2019 The dino brought her hands up to the temples of her head and looked to Anon with a growing grimace. \u201cOh Anon, why won\u2019t you wake up and tell me what happened to you!?\u201d the lime dino groaned as she again collapsed on the couch.\n\n   With a sigh of defeat, Stella looked up at the clock on the wall. The minute hand had only moved thirty whole minutes. As she narrowed her eyes, the minute hand moved forward one space. That caused the stegosaur to drop back her head in defeat. She considered for a second putting on an anime on her phone to pass the time, but one side glance towards Anon killed that plan. Not because she didn\u2019t think it was in poor taste to watch something fun and entertaining next to a man who may or may not be braindead, but rather because she would have much preferred to share that show with that man. If Anon was suffering, then she too deserved to suffer. If nothing else because she had helped to lead Anon down the road that led to his current unconsciousness.\n\n   With grim determination in her heart, Stella pulled out her phone and logged into her Rocktube account. With some hesitation, she navigated towards a playlist titled \u2018Only play this if you want to feel absolutely, UNEQUIVOCALLY terrible.' She moved to tap on the list, but her finger hung a few centimeters away from the screen. Some subconscious part of her brain was forcing her hand to freeze in place. She glared at her hand before putting the rest of her willpower into moving that finger. At last, though, she got the result she wanted and managed to tap on the playlist. With a click, a sixty-video long list of the most terrible anime openings ever put to both screen and music loaded up.\n\n   The first song on the list, titled \u2018Gundoh Mushashi OP\u2019 began playing. Within the first few seconds, Stella felt a jolt run down her spine, down her legs, and right into her tail. She had heard buzzsaws carry a better tune. She could almost feel the blood pouring out from her ears as the song played for an agonizingly long one minute and thirty seconds. When that song at last ended, the next song on the list, \u2018Spiral OP\u2019 began playing. The female singer\u2019s high-pitched voice combined with what sounded like an unfiltered drum played through a broken speaker followed. The two sounds combined so horribly that Stella was certain that VVRUM DRAMA back when they were still using two bases could have done a much better job playing the song. When that at last ended, a song titled \u2018Kill Me Baby\u2019 played its uneven, chaotic melody. The singers obviously did very little in the way of caring aside from getting a paycheck, something that made Stella grind her teeth in rage.\n\n   Stella was doing her best to hold together and not turn off her phone in disgust. \u2018Suffering tempers the soul,' she told herself as another horrible OP, this one titled \u2018Hentai!\u2019 of all things, played. As the absurd lyrics talking about all kinds of lewd things and the less than subpar animation performed before her, the lime stego actually began to envy Anon. For in his inability to listen to such horrible music, he was in true bliss...\n\n   ...That was until Anon\u2019s hand very suddenly dropped on top of Stella\u2019s phone, pausing the video and bringing about ecstatic silence once again.\n\n   '...Wait a sec...' Stella thought as her eyes fell on Anon's arm.\n\n   Stella let out a sharp scream as she recoiled from the surprise. Anon, meanwhile, glared daggers at the dino, his eyes sunken yet glowing with absolute fury; like at that very second, he wanted nothing more than to wrap his hands around Stella\u2019s neck and wring the life right out of her for even thinking about playing such foul abominations of the melodic arts.\n\n   \u201cYour\u2026 taste\u2026 in... OP\u2019s\u2026 is absolute\u2026 dog shit\u2026 St-Stella...\u201d Anon hissed through clenched teeth, his hand shaking as he struggled to keep it placed over the screen.\n\n   Shock soon gave way to surprise, which then gave way to confusion, which then gave way to relief and joy, all within the span of less than a second. \u201cANON!\u201d Stella shouted as she tossed herself on Anon, wrapping her arms around the still weak human.\n\n   Anon, for his part, was utterly confused about what was going on. One moment, he had been lying in his flat feeling hotter than he\u2019d ever felt and getting drunker and higher than he\u2019d ever been. After that, he saw flashes of things he did. Running down a street, walking on the beach, punching himself in an attempt at self-punishment, smashing his own head against concrete... He couldn\u2019t recall more particular things than that. The only thing he knew was that his face and head both hurt like hell.\n\n   One of the nurses burst through the door a second after Stella had screamed. \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2014\u201d she cut off herself the instant she saw Anon\u2019s eyes fix themselves on her. \u201cHoly mother of\u2014\u201d she began but paused before turning around. \u201cGet the doctor! The patient\u2019s awake!\u201d she shouted as she walked into the room. Without a word, she motioned for Stella to relocate. Reluctantly, the lime stego moved as the nurse rushed next to Anon. Within the second, she checked his IV drip and the rest of his vitals, all the while adjusting the bed so that Anon could better lay on it without having to strain his back. \n\n   Less than a minute later, the doctor rushed into the room, his eyes falling on Anon with a mixture of surprise and delight. He walked up to Anon\u2019s bed and gave his nurse a nod. \u201cThank you so very much. I\u2019ll take this here case from here.\u201d \n\n   With a respectful nod, the nurse left the room, leaving only Anon, the doctor, and Stella.\n\n   \u201cWell, color me surprised, but you had us scared for almost nine hours now. Glad to see you awake, uh\u2026 Anon, was it?\u201d\n\n   Anon gave the doctor a nod before bringing a hand to his head. The instant he touched one of the bandages, he retracted his limb with a hiss of pain.\n\n   \u201cWoah. Easy now!\u201d the doctor said, stepping closer to anon and gently patting him on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re still very tender. In fact, I\u2019m shocked you\u2019re even awake at all!\u201d\n\n   Anon blinked a few times, his eyes traveling between Stella and the doctor. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, his voice still raspy and weak.\n\n   \u201cWell, for starters, someone beat the living tar out of you. Secondly, you were so loaded on alcohol and cannabis that I\u2019m shocked you didn\u2019t give up the ghost then and there. Finally, you took such a hard knock on that there nogging of yours that I\u2019m astonished you\u2019re even aware right now!\u201d He grabbed a clipboard from the front of the bed and began writing down on it. \u201cYes sir. You, my homo-sapien amigo, are very lucky that this here young lady found you when she did. Had you stayed on that beach after sunrise, you would have died not just from all those there injuries, but dehydration too.\u201d The doctor turned to look at Stella. \u201cWhat was your name again, miss?\u201d\n\n   \u201cS-Stella,\u201d the stegosaur stammered.\n\n   \u201cWell, Miss Stella and Mr. Anon. Vitals are looking good. The only thing left now is observation.\u201d The doctor finished writing on the clipboard and set his eyes on Anon. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep you overnight and see if any complications arise. If nothing seems to be going south, then we should be able to let you go tomorrow morning. I suggest you get yourself some grub, catch up with your friend here, and get yourself some rest.\u201d The doctor placed the clipboard back on the bed\u2019s front. \u201cOh, and don\u2019t worry about any medical expenses. Half of it's covered by your GI benefits. The other by a family member of yours.\u201d The doctor let out a well-meaning chuckle. \u201cI really do love it when family sticks together.\u201d\n\n   As the doctor left the room, Anon couldn\u2019t help but wonder who this \u2018family\u2019 the doctor had told him about was. Last he checked, his own parents had written him off for dead. It couldn\u2019t be any of his Navy comrades either. He never got along with any of them beyond the whole team building bull. He had no other people on earth that could claim to care about him either\u2026\n\n   Anon\u2019s head began throbbing, and he took that as a sign that he needed to stop thinking. He lay his head back on the now angled bed and turned to look at Stella, who for some reason was wearing what looked like a very familiar tracksuit. He blinked a few times and let out a dry laugh. \u201cWhy\u2026 are you\u2026 wearing... Subaru\u2026 Natsuki\u2019s... tracksuit?\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s eyes lit up like they were Christmas decorations. \u201cY-you can tell!?\u201d she almost shouted, her tail instinctively wrapping around her leg.\n\n   Anon sighed and turned away from the stegosaur. \u201cFour\u2026 years. I don\u2019t\u2026 fucking see you\u2026 for four\u2026 years\u2026 and you\u2019re still\u2026 the same\u2026 weeb\u2026\u201d He let out another dry chuckle as he closed his eyes. \u201cPeople\u2026 never\u2026 change\u2026\u201d he whispered bitterly.\n\n   Stella tilted her head to the side, not sure what to make of Anon's comment. Not that it mattered anyway, as her previous excitement returned in full force as she rushed back to Anon\u2019s bedside, eyes once more aglow with barely-contained glee. \u201cSo, did you watch any good shows while in the navy!?\u201d Stella asked with almost child-like energy.\n\n   Anon turned back to look at Stella\u2019s eyes. At first, he felt tempted to make a snide remark about growing up. That thought fell away as a question formed on his lips instead. \u201cHow\u2026 did you know\u2026 I was in the\u2026 navy?\u201d\n\n   \u201cYour anchor tattoo!\u201d Stella answered, pointing at Anon\u2019s right arm. \u201cAlso... your new musculature\u2026\u201d she bashfully said as she tapped her fingers together and looked down at her feet.\n\n   Anon let some air out of his nose. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d he started, his eyes once again falling on Stella\u2019s light blue eyes. \u201cWhy did\u2026 you\u2026 save me\u2026?\u201d\n\n   Stella again tilted her head in confusion. \u201cWhy did I save you?\u201d she repeated the question with some incredulity. \u201cWhy WOULDN\u2019T I save an old friend!\u201d she answered with such sickening sweetness that Anon couldn\u2019t help but feel that one in his heart. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in four years. NO ONE has. We\u2026 we all thought you had died, Anon. DIED!\u201d   \n\n   Anon\u2019s face turned into a grimace at Stella\u2019s words. \u201cI might... as well... have died...\u201d he whispered. \n\n   Stella gasped, a grimace forming on her face. \u201cWhy would you say something as awful as that!\u201d she almost shouted in rage.\n\n   Anon opened his eyes as wide as he could and stared right into Stella\u2019s soul. \u201cI have... nothing... to impart on to you. I straight fucked it\u2026 this life\u2026\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s tail dropped along with her mood. \u201cI guess you haven\u2019t exactly had the best four years of your life, huh?\u201d\n\n   Anon didn\u2019t even dignify Stella with an answer, only continuing to give the lime dino a soul-piercing glare.\n\n   Stella stood up straight and put on a determined face. \u201cAnon, listen to me and listen well. Just because you feel like you\u2019ve screwed your life beyond repair doesn\u2019t mean you actually have. You\u2019re still here and are still alive, aren\u2019t you?!\u201d\n\n   Anon opened his mouth to speak, but he promptly shut it when Stella once again moved forward, her face only inches away from his.\n\n   \u201cAs long as we are alive, we can work towards a better tomorrow. So what if we suffer along the way? So what if we stumble and fall? We have to get back up and keep moving ahead!\u201d\n\n   \u201cI don\u2019t... think I\u2019m capable of that\u2026\u201d Anon whispered, his eyes shifting away from Stella's own soul-piercing stare. \u201cI\u2026 I have committed horrible sins\u2026 and I hate myself for it\u2026\u201d He bit his own lip and turned to look at Stella, yes shimmering. \u201cI fucked up so, so bad!\u201d the human shouted, his voice still coarse, but his tone uninterrupted and heartfelt. \u201cI ran away when I should\u2019ve faced the consequences of my actions. I tried to numb the pain with booze and weed and apathy. I\u2026 I had a chance to start over\u2026 and I still chose to be apathetic!\u201d The human took an uneven, wavering breath as he again looked away from Stella. \u201cI\u2026 I think I even tried to kill myself last night\u2026 which is why I\u2019m this fucked mess of a man\u2026\u201d He closed his eyes, a tear flowing from his right eye. \u201cPeople don\u2019t change, Stella. I haven\u2019t changed\u2026 I don't believe in myself anymore\u2026\u201d\n\n   Anon opened his eyes to both clear the tears and to see Stella\u2019s face of devastation over his words. Instead, he opened his eyes to see a lime-toned stegosaur with the most outraged expression he had ever seen. While her eyes shimmered also, her cheeks had turned a deep crimson, the heat radiating from them almost overwhelming to the human.\n\n   Before Anon had a chance to say or do anything, Stella placed a foot upon his bedside and crossed her arms, holding her head up high, all the while still looking deep into Anon\u2019s eyes. \n\n   \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in yourself, then that\u2019s fine!\u201d Stella started in a boomy voice that Anon had never heard from her. \u201cDon\u2019t believe in yourself, Anon!\u201d she thundered, all the while pointing her right index finger at Anon. \n\n   It was now Anon\u2019s turn to tilt his head to the side. \u201c...What...?\u201d he asked, unsure of what to make of Stella\u2019s words.\n\n   \u201cDon't believe in the me that believes in you, and DON\u2019T believe in the you that believes in me. Instead, believe in yourself who believes in you!\u201d Stella again leaned towards Anon, a wide and confident ear to ear smile on her lips. \u201cDon't get distracted by the what-if's, should-have's, and if-only's. The one thing you choose for yourself\u2026 that is the truth of your universe!\u201d she ended, once again crossing her arms for emphasis.\n\n   There was silence in the room for almost half a minute. In that time, Stella still pointed her finger at Anon, all the while holding one leg up and striking her crossed arms pose.\n\n   Anon, meanwhile, was trying\u2014and failing\u2014to make sense of Stella\u2019s words. Despite his throbbing headache, he did force himself to try and make some semblance of reason when it came to Stella\u2019s motivational speech. Only when he ran the words over his head for the tenth time did he recognize that the words didn\u2019t belong to Stella at all.\n\n   Anon narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou... stole that from Kamina... didn\u2019t you\u2026?\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s reaction to Anon\u2019s discovery was twofold. First, Stella lost all composure and nearly fell on her rear. The only thing that kept her upright was her tail. Next was her putting on a goofy little simper. Finally, the stego gave Anon another wide-eyed and glowy stare, as if trying to divert his attention.\n\n   Try as he did, Anon couldn\u2019t help but find Stella's stare adorable...\n\n   Anon sighed and rolled his eyes. \u201cYou know that quote only works if the person I\u2019m going to believe in is strong and full of hot-blooded spirit, right?\u201d\n\n   Stella finally let go of her pose and moved next to Anon again, once again taking on a more conservative posture. \u201cAm I not someone you can put your full unquestioning trust in?\u201d Stella asked with a bit of disappointment in her voice.\n\n   Anon shook his head and let out a soft chuckle. \u201cHonestly, no.\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s expression soured a bit as she again looked down at the floor.\n\n   \u201cHowever,\u201d Anon added, his words snapping Stella from her low. \u201cI\u2026 think I get what you were trying to tell me\u2026\u201d The human looked at his hand, which he clenched into a fist. \u201cI can\u2019t keep living in the past and beating myself over mistakes that I already made. I have to learn from those mistakes and face the future. Have to man the fuck up and set right what I so stupidly set wrong in the first place.\u201d\n\n   \u201cNot just you...\u201d Stella interrupted meekly. \u201cI\u2019m also responsible.\u201d\n\n   Anon narrowed his eyes. \u201cHow the fuck are you responsible? You were at prom enjoying yourself while I went and fucked everything up with Fang.\u201d\n\n   Stella sighed and reached into the purse next to the sofa. She pulled out a deck of tarot cards, one Anon was very familiar with.\n\n   \u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to be fucking with me!\u201d Anon bemoaned as he raised his hands up in the air. \u201cTarot cards? That\u2019s your big \u2018mistake\u2019!?\u201d\n\n   \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. The day Fang and the others played at Dino Moe\u2019s I gave you a reading that\u2026 I... that I failed to explain\u2026\u201d\n\n   Anon rolled his eyes again. \u201cYeah, I remember. \u2018Inverted empress,\u2019 followed by some cryptic warning before you\u2026 fucked off to the bathroom.\u201d\n\n   Stella nodded, again sitting down on the couch. \u201cI pulled the card, but I neglected to tell you what it REALLY meant for you. Then, despite knowing of your confusion, I said nothing else because\u2026\u201d Stella closed her eyes and sighed. \u201c...Because I was afraid. Afraid that you would make fun of me. Afraid that you would do the opposite to prove me wrong. Afraid to...\" the dino's whole body trembled as she pushed past some self-imposed inhibitor. \"... Afraid to realize that I WANTED to help you\u2026 even though you never liked me as more than a friend. If I was even a friend to you at all\u2026\u201d She slammed the tarot deck on the nearby table and left it there, her face scrunching into a scowl of both pain and anguish. \u201cI so wanted you to like me back then. I\u2026 I mean, we were both weebs and outcasts. Why couldn\u2019t we help fill each other\u2019s loneliness too?\u201d She sobbed deeply. \u201cThe real reason I ran out on you that night was because a part of me wanted things to fall apart for you. If you\u2026 if you messed everything up with Fang... then you would have been all alone again. Then I could have found you, and we would have bonded and become happy together as fellow lovers of anime...\" She brought her hands up to her face, the damn finally breaking as the dino began to weep in the most heart-wrenching way imaginable.\n\n   Anon, despite his desire to keep a stoic expression, couldn\u2019t help but feel the same sadness that Stella did. His experience in Dead End had left him wary of ever showing that he loved something. It got to the point that he began vilifying the very idea of showing his passions to anyone, hiding it all away so that no one could ever use his passions to hurt him. When he had first met Stella, he immediately pegged her as someone to avoid and belittle, and all because she was more open about a love he felt he had to hide from the world. Yet when his true power level became known to all, she was, along with Fang and Rosa and Reed, all there to support him through it... \n\n   With a still shaky arm, Anon put his right hand on Stella\u2019s shoulder. As the lime dino turned to look him in the eye, he tried his best to put on a sympathetic smile for her. He had no words to tell her, but he hoped his expression\u2014as battered as it was\u2014would be enough to convey what he wanted to tell her; that even in his fucked, broken, and apathetic life, he didn\u2019t hate her. Maybe in some alternate universe, they could have been something more than friends. A happy pair of dweebs whose idea of romance was rewatching old mecha shows while planning out their next trip to an anime convention... \n\n   Stella grabbed Anon\u2019s hand with her own two hands and cuddled it. He felt a goosebump run up his arm and down his spine when he felt Stella's skin. He hadn\u2019t felt anything so soft in nearly four years.\n\n   The two friends stayed silent for another minute before Stella let Anon\u2019s hands go and once again picked up her Tarot deck. \u201cAnon\u2026 I know you don\u2019t believe in fortunes and stuff\u2026 but do you\u2026 do you want me to give you a quick reading? For old time\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\n   Anon hesitated for a second. He really didn't have the best memories when it came to Stella\u2019s fortune-telling. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t deny that she loved it, her flair for the occult being second to none. He also didn\u2019t want to upset her again, especially bearing each other's hearts to one another.\n\n   \u201cSure. I\u2019d\u2026 love to,\u201d Anon said in as neutral a tone as he could muster. His voice felt like it was about ready to give out from the previous strains.\n\n   With Anon\u2019s blessing, Stella shuffled the tarot deck several times over with a showy level of showmanship that he hadn\u2019t quite ever seen from the lime stegosaur. Seeing her twist the cards, shuffle and re-shuffle them, divide the two into piles that she then pulled and brought together was mesmerizing. \n\n   After about thirty seconds of shuffling, Stella held the deck out to anon. \u201cTake one,\u201d she told Anon. \n\n   With a still shaky hand and a heart bearing some hesitation, Anon placed a hand on the top card of the deck and drew it. He waited exactly one second before turning the card around. \n\n   The card's art was that of an angelic being\u2014one that looked like a cross between a human and dino\u2014residing on top of a cloud while blowing a trumpet. Below it, a human male and a ptero female reached out to the angeling being, as if either asking for salvation or begging for forgiveness. \n\n   Anon looked at the card\u2019s name. Before he could say the name himself, Stella spoke it for him.\n\n   \u201cUpright Judgement,\u201d Stella stated as she leaned her head next to Anon\u2019s. \u201cYou are being called to follow a new path or incorporate a new practice in your life. What you have and where you are is not who you're meant to be. It\u2019s time to embrace change. A new era is about to begin...\u201d Stella explained. \u201cAnon\u2026 I think\u2026 I think this means that\u2026\u201d the dino didn\u2019t finish her words, the weight of the card\u2019s meaning hitting her so hard that it forced her to take a seat.\n\n   Anon and Stella once more grew quiet as they absorbed the meaning of the card. As the two reconnected and reconciled friends looked at each other, they both knew that all the events the led to this point couldn\u2019t all be mere coincidence. The odds were too low and the world too chaotic. Yet what else could it be?\n\n   Anon wasn\u2019t one to believe in such things as hokey religions and fate, but even he was finding it hard to rationalize it\u2026\n\n   Before either Stella or Anon could say another word to each other, the door to their room opened. In walked a pterosaur doctor, his light brown skin accentuating the orange crests on his head and underbeak. Unlike other dinos of his species though, one of his wings looked shriveled. From the scars and missing pieces, it looked like it had gotten crippled many years earlier... \n\n   Anon\u2019s eyes went wide with shock as memories began flooding back to him. \n\n   Stella, for her part, stood up, her hands moving up to her mouth as she tried, and failed to suppress a gasp.\n\n   The pterosaur looked at the stegosaur and human before his gaze fell squarely on Anon. As it did, his expression changed to a mixture of nostalgic delight and barely restrained wrath.\n\n   \u201cHello... \u2018brother'...\u201d the dino spat, his every syllable laden to the brim with vitriol, almost as if speaking the words caused the dino\u2019s beak to ache and his very stomach to turn.\n\n   Anon\u2019s eyes, still wide\u2014and mouth just as widely agape\u2014could only form one name on his tongue...\n\n   \u201cN-Naser?\u201d","encoded":false},"A Better End Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Multiple","A Better End Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"   Chapter 3 - The Tower\n\n   \u201cHello... \u2018brother'...\u201d the pterodactyl spat, his every syllable laded to the brim with vitriol, almost as if speaking the words caused the dino\u2019s beak to ache and his very stomach to turn.\n\n   Anon\u2019s eyes, still wide\u2014and mouth just as widely agape\u2014could only form one name on his tongue\u2026\n\n   \u201cN-Naser?\u201d\n\n   There was no answer from Naser. Instead, the dino only continued giving the human a steely, hateful glare.  \n\n   The room went as quiet and as still as a morgue after Anon\u2019s words. As the seconds ticked by, neither human nor pterodactyl spoke another word. The only hint that time had not stopped was the sound of the clock's hands and the faint hum of the fluorescent lights.    \n\n   Stella was the first person in the room to break the silence. \u201cNaser\u2026 is that... really you?\u201d she asked, taking a single step forward.  As the stego inspected her former classmate and once-upon-a-time top student, she found herself scarcely able to believe what she was seeing. As she tried looking deep into Naser's eyes, she found herself looking into what almost seemed like a void. It was that more than anything that forced her body to move between Anon and Naser, almost as if her instinct warned her that something terrible was about to happen between them. \n\n   Much like with Anon, Naser disappeared not long after graduating from Volcano High. Unlike Anon, Naser\u2019s departure had less to do with completely falling off the face of the earth and more with his entry into medical school. Everyone knew where Naser would go. They just never expected him to go so soon and so unceremoniously. After four years of absence, to see him standing before her garbed in a doctor\u2019s coat and with a grim look of ice-cold fury sent chills run down her spine. In her mind, she had wanted their reunion to be perfect, her and the others laughing about their lives up to that point. But, of course, considering everything that had happened up to that point, that dream was just that... a dream.\n\n   Naser redirected his hate-filled stare towards Stella. While downright soft compared to the glower he had on Anon, it nonetheless remained sharp enough to pierce through steel. \u201cStella,\u201d the ptero acknowledged. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking\u2026 what are you doing here with\u2026 him...?\u201d he hissed his last words out, almost like it was taking all his willpower to not rush forward and strangle Anon.\n\n   Stella, swallowing hard and giving a side glance towards Anon, put on the best smile that she could muster on her lips. \u201cOh, you know, the usual that you\u2019d do with someone you haven\u2019t seen in four years! Catch up, reminisce a bit, be glad that they\u2019re alive...\u201d She took another step to the right, this time getting completely between Naser and Anon. \u201cStuff like that!\u201d she added with a wave of her hand and a giggle.\n\n   Naser sighed and put a hand to the ridge of his nose. \u201cStella\u2026 you\u2026 haven\u2019t changed at all.\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s brow furrowed a bit. Even so, she still gave her former classmate a broad simper. \u201cSure haven\u2019t!\u201d she exclaimed, giving Naser a wink while sticking her tongue out.\n\n   Naser took an ominous step forward. \u201cStella\u2026 I\u2019m only going to say this once. Get out of here.\u201d He again set his glare on Anon.\n\n   Stella\u2019s smile completely dissolved as she took a step forward and glared at Naser. \u201cNo,\u201d she snapped in reply. \u201cNaser\u2026 I know that you\u2019re angry at Anon, b\u2014\u201d\n\n   \u201cANGRY!?\u201d Naser shouted at the top of his lungs. His raised tone, combined with a contorted grimace of utter wrath, completely interrupted whatever it was that Stella wanted to say, causing her to flinch and recoil backward. \u201c\u2018Angry\u2019 doesn\u2019t even BEGIN to describe what I\u2019m feeling at this second!\u201d \n\n   Before Stella could even think of something else to say, Naser took another step forward. As he did, he clenched his fists into white-knuckled fists as he glared fiery daggers at Anon. \u201cNever in my life have I felt the rage I\u2019m feeling at this very instant. Four years; four FUCKING years I\u2019ve carried this!\u201d he pointed an accusatory finger towards the human. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all because of him! He caused everything to fall apart! Our perfect lives, our perfect futures! If it wasn\u2019t for that... fucker, Fang wouldn\u2019t have run away. If it wasn\u2019t for him, Naomi wouldn\u2019t have dumped me like a piece of trash. If it wasn\u2019t for him, I wouldn\u2019t have had to work my ass off so hard to keep my parents from falling further into hopelessness!\u201d He set his gaze back on Stella. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not only me he fucked over. Trish, Reed, Rosa, even you! EVERYONE would have had a better life if it wasn\u2019t for this self-centered piece of shit!\u201d\n\n   Despite quaking in her shoes in response to Naser\u2019s outburst, Stella took yet another step forward. Her move put her only inches away from her former classmate's face. It was only at that distance that Stella noticed how much taller Naser had gotten in the last four years. Tall enough that he was on par with his father now. \u201cAnon may be responsible for what happened with Fang\u2026 but he\u2019s not to blame for everyone else\u2019s misfortune!\u201d Stella snapped back at Naser, this time poking him in the chest for added emphasis.\n\n   Naser scoffed and looked at Stella with disbelief. \u201cAre you that deluded? You can trace everyone\u2019s misfortunes back to Anon!\u201d\n\n   Stella looked like she was ready to start shouting at Naser when Anon suddenly spoke.\n\n   \u201cStella,\u201d he started, causing the stego to turn back and look at him. \u201cNaser\u2026 Naser\u2019s right...\u201d\n\n   Stella shook her head in disbelief. Anon only closed his eyes and let out a sigh. \u201cNaser\u2026 I\u2026 I know I don\u2019t have any right to say this\u2026 but I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\n\n   Naser practically shoved his way past Stella to stand right next to the human\u2019s bed. From up above, the pterodactyl fixed the human with a glower so fervent that his amber eyes felt like they could start a fire at any second. As he did, he grasped his hands into fists, the skin on his knuckles threatening to tear from the force.\n\n   \u201cNo. You\u2019re not sorry,\u201d Naser replied before lunging forward and grabbing Anon by the gruff of his hospital gown. With a rage-full lift, he brought the human up so he was at eye level with him. \u201cIf you were sorry, you wouldn't have ever shown your face in this town again!\u201d\n\n   \u201cAnon!\u201d Stella shouted as she rushed forward to try and break Naser\u2019s grip on the human. She wrapped her hands around the pterodactyl's arm, but she found she didn\u2019t have enough muscle to make the arm budge even a millimeter. \u201cPut him down!\u201d she shouted, tears pooling in his eyes as she struggled to separate the human and dino. \u201cPlease!\" she sobbed. \"This\u2026 this isn't what friends should be doing to each other...\u201d\n\n   Naser scoffed in reply to Stella's words. Despite the fury on his face remaining\u2014if not intensifying\u2014he let go of Anon. The human fell back on the bed, coughing and attempting to scramble away from the sizeable pissed-off pterodactyl still standing over him. \n\n   \u201c...\u2018Friend\u2019...\u201d Naser repeated in a sickened tone as he stepped away from Anon's bedside. He did not say another word as he snatched the clipboard at the base of the bed and looked it over. After reading it, he seized the top page, crumpling it in his hand and stuffing it in his coat. Without so much as another word, he turned around and opened the door. But before he left the room, he gave Anon and Stella one final glance before walking out and shutting the door.\n\n   Anon let out a deep breath and let himself collapse. He put a hand on his chest and tried to calm his speeding heart. But, unfortunately, it was easier said than done.\n\n   Stella fell upon Anon and began checking his body for any injury. When she found none, she let out a massive sigh of relief and sat back down on the nearby couch. Seconds later, she began sniffing as she brought a hand up to her face in a desperate attempt to hold back tears.\n\n   Despite feeling like he had no right to, Anon again put a hand on his friend's shoulder. Like she had done earlier, the lime stego grabbed the human's hand and cuddled it up to her face. Anon was again taken back by the softness of Stella\u2019s skin. It made his face feel warm and brought him ease. Or at least, as much ease as he could have considered what had happened. \n\n   Anon looked in Stella\u2019s direction, expecting to see a semblance of a smile or something to tell him that she was alright. Instead, he was only met with a sunken and defeated expression from the stegosaur.\n\n   \u201cStella,\u201d Anon started, forcing the stego to look him in the eyes again. \u201c...This\u2026 this wasn\u2019t... your fault\u2026\u201d he whispered, all the while gently cradling her cheek.\n\n   Stella slowly began perking in response to the human\u2019s words. She looked at him with her own light blue eyes. The deeper she looked, though, the damper her eyes got. It wasn\u2019t long before her vision became a hazy mess as tears began flowing. Whatever smile she once carried vanished as the total weight of the last few minutes sunk in. She let another soul-crushing sob, and before the human could say or do anything to comfort his friend, she fell upon his chest, grabbing hold of his arms for support all the while wailing in anguish.\n\n   Anon wanted so badly to say something to ease Stella\u2019s sadness, but he couldn\u2019t find any words that he could say that wouldn\u2019t be in agreement with Naser. \u2018He has every right to hate me,\u2019 he bitterly yet legitimately thought. He had more than earned his former classmate's ire\u2026 and a hell of a lot more than that. With no other thought in his mind, he put a hand on Stella\u2019s head in an attempt to comfort her as she cried her heart out\u2026\n\n \n\n   Naser stood outside of Anon\u2019s room for about a second before scoffing and walking off in disgust. He couldn\u2019t fathom why Stella would stick by Anon considering he had done everything in his power to scorn her once upon a time. \u2018Yet there she stood defending the bastard. Then she dares to cry because I have every right at being angry?\u2019\n\n   Naser hissed in annoyance, bringing his fist up in preparation to hit the nearest wall. Instead, he took a deep breath and exhaled. He reached into his coat and pulled out the crumbled-up paper he had taken from Anon\u2019s bed and looked it over again, a grimace forming on his lips. \n\n   Unlike everyone else, Naser had not once accepted that Anon had gone and died without no one noticing. Deep down in the pterodactyl's heart, he knew the human was too stubborn and spiteful. He had been so confident in that knowledge, he waited, imagining for four years what he would do to the human if he ever saw him again. He again took a deep breath to get his anger under control. He did this now as much as he did when he began medical school right out of high school. But, in a twist of irony that wasn\u2019t entirely lost on him. The same unbridled fury he felt for the human helped him get through his higher education. Begrudgingly, the rage he couldn\u2019t channel towards beating Anon became his fuel. It drove him to work harder than any of his peers, pushing his very natural limits past the point where anyone else would have burnt out. It cost him though, as he eschewed all social connections and any personal growth beyond his medical career. Whereas other peers found friends, even love, with each other, he pushed on with his singular goal. Yet as he got closer to his graduation, a deep fog of uncertainty fell over him. What would he do when he reached his end goal? Where would he go? Graduating not top of the class, but also early earned him calls from hospitals the world over. A ticket to anywhere in the world... yet he chose Volcaldera Bluffs' hospital. The equivalent of working at a convenience store. \n\n   What had brought Naser back to the very place that he had run away from just a little over two weeks ago? He didn't know. Or least, he hadn't known... until earlier that day, when he had seen Anon\u2019s name and face in the recent admittance records. How he had believed it to be a trick of his imagination. That he would read over the name again only to realize his brain had played a cruel joke on him. That the picture of the bald, almost featureless human he had seen was his wishful thinking and nothing else. But a closer inspection had revealed to him that it was no hoax. Anon was in his hospital, and he was for once in a position of power over the human, his life in his hands. Anon was back into his life... except for the troublesome fact that Anon had returned to his life as a patient\u2026\n\n   For the first time since finishing medical school, Naser felt great regret at taking the Hippocratic oath. As a doctor, he could not harm anyone. Sure, there wasn\u2019t a technical punishment for breaking the oath, but becoming an oathbreaker wasn\u2019t exactly an appealing prospect. There was also the threat of getting slapped with malpractice. If that happened, then all his struggles and sacrifices graduating from medical school would be for naught. \n\n   In the absence of a more immediate solution to his problem, Naser came up with a plan. A risky strategy, but one that was his only real recourse. \n\n   First, Naser had claimed Anon as a sibling. The idea made his stomach churn. It not only meant having to pay for the human's hospital stay out of his own pocket, but it also meant faking a blood relation with the human. Even so, having Anon as his brother on paper gave him a bit more leeway for the next part of his plan, which was to become Anon\u2019s physician. Once he had direct and exclusive access to the human's health, he would be in almost complete authority.\n\n   From there, all it would take to take care of Anon would be a convenient \u2018accident.' Maybe a bit more air would find its way inside of Anon's IV solution. Maybe Anon would need some kind of surgery, at which point one of his major arteries could be \u2018accidentally\u2019 severed. Or perhaps Anon would need to ingest some type of medicine, and he would \u2018accidentally\u2019 get drugs that were past their expiration date. Even in the best-operated hospitals, accidents happened and were a lot more common than people wanted to admit... \n\n   With thoughts that shouldn\u2019t live inside of a doctor\u2019s mind, Naser gave the paper in his hand one final confirmatory read before once again stuffing the sheet in his coat. He took a deep breath and buried whatever leftover anger he still had. Then, with his mind fixed on the next part of his plan, he walked up to the second floor\u2019s receptionist. \n\n   \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d Naser said in a confident, albeit forced, tone.\n\n   \u201cAfternoon. How can I help you?\u201d the receptionist, an earthen brown gorgosaurus in a blue nurse's outfit, asked without turning away from her computer screen.\n\n   Naser inwardly scoffed at the receptionist\u2019s rudeness but maintained his smile. \u201cI need to speak to Director Joshua if he\u2019s available.\u201d\n\n   The receptionist finally looked away from her computer screen and inspected Naser a bit before putting on a simper. \u201cOh, you\u2019re the new doctor we hired two weeks ago! Naser Aaran, right?\u201d\n\n   \u201cThe one and only,\u201d Naser answered, the smirk on his lips never wavering despite how forced it was.\n\n   The nurse ran a hand through her short curly black hair as she gave her full attention to Naser. \u201cA lot of talk going around about you!\u201d She said, leaning in a bit closer to the pterodactyl. \u201cIs it true that you graduated one year early?\u201d\n\n   Naser felt his brow twitch a bit but maintained a polite smile on his lips. \u201cYes, I did. Wasn\u2019t easy!\u201d He answered. He wanted so badly to grimace at his own words, but he couldn\u2019t let the receptionist pick up on any sign of weakness.\n\n   The receptionist let out a whistle and went back to typing something on her computer. \u201cWell, congratulations on the D.O. then,\u201d she concluded whatever it was that she was clicking away at and again turned to look at Naser. \u201cSo, you want to see if Mr. Joshua is available?\u201d\n\n   \u201cYes, that would be very considerate.\u201d\n\n   The receptionists again perked an eyebrow. \u201cThe director is a very busy man. What\u2019s the occasion?\u201d\n\n   Naser steeled himself for the words that were about to come out of his mouth\u2026\n\n   \u201cWell, you see, my\u2026 brother\u2026 recently got into an accident, and he wound up admitted into our hospital.\u201d \n\n   The receptionist\u2019s expression softened. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, is he okay?\u201d\n\n   Naser had to fight the urge to frown at the reminder. \u201cHe\u2019s doing fine! Was out for a while, but he woke up less than an hour ago\u2026\u201d\n\n   The receptionist perked at hearing the news. \u201cOh, wonderful!\u201d\n\n   \u2018Yeah, absolutely wonderful...\u2019 Naser thought as he continued to force a grin on his lips. \u201cUnfortunately, he suffered some cranial trauma, so he might be here for a while.\u201d\n\n   \u201cOh, so my guess is that you want to transfer his health care to your account?\u201d The receptionist asked Naser\n\n   \u201cAlready did,\u201d Naser answered, the words causing him no short supply of grief. \u201cI feel like I could give him a bit more direct care though, so I wanted to ask the director if I could become his direct physician. At latest until he's ready for his discharge.\u201d\n\n   The receptionist was silent and stoic for a second before giving Naser a warm smile. \u201cAw, family really does stick together!\u201d she announced in a sickenly cute voice, one that the ptero couldn't help but compare to his ex-girlfriend's mannerisms.\n\n   Naser forced himself to grin even wider despite the vile he was feeling churning in his stomach. As the discomfort in his gut grew, he started to worry that he might develop an ulcer. \n\n   \u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and page the director. Give me a second.\u201d The receptionist said she reached for the phone next to her computer and dialed a number with practiced speed. A few seconds later, the receptionist spoke to the receiver. \u201cDirector Joshua? Yes. I have Doctor Naser here wanting to talk to you. Yeah. Says it\u2019s about his sibling who was recently admitted to our hospital. Hmmm. Okay. I\u2019ll send him to you right away then.\u201d\n\n   The receptionist hung the phone and turned back to Naser. \u201cThe director will be waiting for you. His office is on the fifth floor. Take a left after you leave the elevators and head straight. You won\u2019t be able to miss the big double doors to his office.\u201d\n\n   \u201cThank you so much,\u201d Naser responded, giving the receptionist a smile and a quick wave before taking off towards the elevators in the foyer. After less than a two minute walk, he reached the elevators and pressed the call button. The elevator only took a minute to arrive. To Naser\u2019s relief, it was empty. \u2018Will give my cheeks a chance to rest,\u2019 he thought as he stepped into the lift and pressed the button for the fifth floor. The elevator then took off without a fuzz, traveling at a reasonable pace, all the while playing a pleasant little jingle.\n\n   As the elevator crawled its way up to the fifth floor, other errant thoughts entered Naser\u2019s mind. He wondered what his parents were up to. He hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to them in four years. Since his return to Volcadera Bluffs two weeks earlier, he still hadn't worked up the courage to even go near his old neighborhood. A part of him felt that he didn\u2019t deserve to face his parents again. How could he when he had failed both as a brother and a son? If he saw his parents again, would they be proud to hear how he graduated so early at the expense of any social and emotional growth? He knew his mother at least wouldn't want to hear that. And of course, there was the biggest elephant in the room, Fang. A part of him dreamed of returning home to find his sister there, waiting with the news that not long after he left for medical school, she changed her mind and came back home. Of course, he knew that was only a dream. Fang vanished so abruptly from everyone's life it was almost as if she had died. The scariest part was that with how Fang left to trace behind, they could very well be dead and no one would ever know\u2026\n\n   Naser put a hand over his face and fought back some tears threatening to form in his eyes. His lack of knowledge on Fang\u2019s whereabouts tormented him to no end\u2026 and he would do anything to just know that she was still alive...\n\n   ...Anything...\n\n   Naser forcefully turned his thoughts away from Fang and onto something else. His mind went back to recalling his conversation with the receptionist. Yet as she thought back to the young and somewhat cute gorgosaur, he recalled someone else who also took a chunk of his soul with her when she left him. His high school ex, Naomi...\n\n   'God-dammit\u2026\u2019 Naser thought as memories of his ex flooded his mind. How he had loved and cared for her\u2026 until she had stopped loving him back. He never understood why she turned so hostile near the end of their relationship. A part of him had always had a suspicion that he desperately wished was false; that she never loved him for who he was, but only for the prestige he brought to her. Blind as he might have been in his younger years, age had brought with it brutal and unforgiving hindsight. In retrospect, he should have seen the signs. Naomi, after all, had always striven to be the best at any one time. Perfectionist to a fault, the moment he showed even a single sign of imperfection, she tossed him aside like a moldy apple in a basket of plum and juicy ones. But like the crazy and loving fool that he was, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she was doing good with her life. Surely, if anyone had made something of themselves, it was Naomi...\n\n   The elevator\u2019s door slid open, and Naser stepped out. He vanished all other thoughts from his mind with an exhale except for those of this most immediate goal. He turned left as the receptionist had instructed and then walked down the hall. The hall itself sported wooden walls. Potted plants and pictures of people that couldn\u2019t be anyone else but members of the board of doctors from years past finished the decor. The added fact that they all sported smiles that seemed superficial only added to Naser\u2019s feeling of unease. As he reached the door, he paused to fix up his coat and ran over his words again. He had come too far to get his words jumbled up and cause hitches to his plans.\n\n   With a twist of the door handles, Naser stepped into the director\u2019s office. It was a relatively large space on the simple side, the only pieces of furniture being a large old-styled work desk and a pair of desk chairs facing the desk. What parts of the wall weren\u2019t large glass windows made of the same wooding out in the hall leading to the office. Instead, much like the hallway outside, the walls donned paintings of natural vistas and a few medical diagrams on both human and dinosaur anatomy. Sitting on the other side of his work desk was a blue-toned archelon who Naser had to guess had to be somewhere in his early sixties. Yet his estimation could have been wildly off, considering the dino still sported a complete set of black-toned hair and even a small yet well-maintained beard. Mr. Joshua also looked sternly build, his chest broad and shockingly well-toned. Considering that he had to lug around a daily bulky shell, it made sense that the director would be on the burly side. Naser couldn\u2019t help but imagine what his boss would have looked like in his younger years. Maybe something between a linebacker and a marine.\n\n   Before Naser\u2019s thoughts could drift away further from him, he\u2019s snapped back to reality when director Joshua acknowledges his presence. \u201cAh, Doctor Naser. What can I do for you today?\u201d\n\n   With one final inhale, Naser steps forward to the base of director Joshua\u2019s desk.\n\n   \u201cGood afternoon Doctor Joshua.\u201d\n\n   \u201cPlease, call me Joshua,\u201d the director responded with an amiable smile.\n\n   Naser cleared his throat. \u201cWell then, Mr. Joshua, I came today because I need to make a request.\u201d\n\n   The director sighed at Naser's unwillingness to stop being so formal and instead moved on. \u201cAh yes, the situation with your \u2018sibling\u2019...\u201d the elder dino said as he reached into a drawer on his desk and brought out a manilla folder he likely had prepped for when Naser got there.\n\n   Naser\u2019s eyes widened as he felt ice drop into the pit of his stomach.\n\n   \u201cDoctor Naser\u2026 I have the understanding that you claimed Mr. Anon Y. Mous as your sibling\u2026 even though you and he are, well... quite unrelated,\u201d Director Joshua started as he gave the files a read. \u201cIt says here that he attended Volcano High for the last six months of his senior year. The same school and same grade level as you.\u201d\n\n   Naser gave his boss a single nod of acknowledgment. \u2018How could I have been so damn stupid?\u2019 he thought to himself as he recalled how every person, no matter how \u2018obscure\u2019 they were in the eyes of society, still had a medical record. It wasn\u2019t like they were living in the middle ages anymore, where all it took was moving from one town to another to completely change identities. What was more, Anon had served in the navy before being medically discharged. So he, of all people, would have a medical record on hand.\n\n   Naser wanted to beat himself up so bad for his stupidity...\n\n   \u201cSo\u2026 my understanding of the situation is that this patient is a\u2026 dear friend of yours, is he not?\u201d the director inquired bluntly, snapping Naser out of his thoughts.\n\n   Naser almost recoiled at his boss\u2019 words. Only practiced stoicism kept him from showing anything other than a confirmatory glance towards the director.\n\n   Director Joshua turned his attention back to Anon\u2019s profile. \u201cSays here, Mr. Mous did not finish school and went straight into the navy\u2019s PACT program. There, he served a four-year tour of duty until suffering an injury on a ladder well. He was then medically discharged two and a half weeks ago.\u201d He closed the manilla folder and put it down. \u201cSounds like he\u2019s had a rough four years.\"\n\n   \"That he has, Mr. Joshua,\" Naser said in his best monotone in an attempt to salvage the situation for himself. \n\n   Director Joshua narrowed his eyes for a second before suddenly changing gears and smiling quite widely. \"No wonder you want to help him out so badly!\u201d he almost cheered unapologetically.\n\n   Naser couldn\u2019t bring himself to say a word. In his mind, he wanted to snap at his boss and tell him that the last thing he had on his mind was helping the human who turned his whole life upside down. After some more careful consideration though, he gave his boss a nod in reply.\n\n   \"The first thing that comes to your mind on seeing an old friend in need is to help him out. That right there is the true spirit of a doctor,\" the director said with perhaps a bit more cheer than was necessary. \"I'm proud of you, my boy!\" he ended his words with a thumb's up.\n\n   Naser wasn't quite sure what to make of his boss' words, but something about them struck him in a way that he couldn't quite describe. A part of him felt revulsion at the idea of helping Anon do anything besides pay for his crimes. Yet, another part of him felt an odd sense of satisfaction at being the better man by assisting Anon to mend whatever wounds had caused him to become so hollow and pathetic in the first place. Yes, he wanted to see Anon pay for his sins... but did he want to damage someone who was already broken to begin with?\n\n   For the first time in four years, Naser found himself questioning his own anger...\n\n   \"Standard insurance policy would dictate that I remove Mr. Anon from your medical insurance, but seeing as you went to so much trouble to fill out his paperwork, I\u2019ll let it slide.\u201d The director said with a chuckle, snapping Naser back to reality. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a fan of how insurances see people as only money Anyway. Besides, it\u2019s not exactly illegal. Just unusual.\u201d The archelon sat upright and put both of his hands back on the desk. \u201cI get the feeling though that the insurance coverage situation wasn\u2019t why you wanted to talk to me, though,\u201d he added in a moderately ominous tone.\n\n   Naser paused to consider what he should do next. His plan was already on very shaky ground; his luck pushed pretty far as it was. He was fortunate that his boss was such an understanding person, but even he would no doubt raise an eyebrow at his request, especially now that the truth was out\u2026\n\n   Naser gripped his hands tight. \u2018No. I\u2019ve come too far now to pussy out,\u2019 he thought resolutely. Maybe it was the rage still burning in him, or perhaps he had really lost his mind from four years of missing out on sleep. Whatever the case, his father hadn\u2019t raised a coward. He was an Aaran, for Raptor Jesus\u2019s sake!\n\n   \u201cMr. Joshua, I want to request becoming Anon\u2019s physician,\u201d Naser almost blurted out.\n\n   The director raised an eyebrow in response to Naser's request. \u201cThat is\u2026 highly unusual,\" he said bluntly. \"Why do you want to do that?\"\n\n   Naser swallowed a lump in his throat and gave his boss as warm a smile as he could muster. \"Anon is... someone dear to me. As his friend, I feel like I'm... uniquely qualified to help him, both physically and emotionally.\"\n\n   The director once again looked at Naser with a flat, indecipherable look. \"Normally, its the patient who makes a physician request, not the other way around,\u201d he announced, bringing a finger to his chin and closing his eyes in contemplation. For five long seconds, the office went quiet as the director submerged himself in thought. Once those five seconds were up, director Joshua opened his eyes again and gave Naser a warm smile. \u201cWell, seeing as you are already claiming Mr. Anon as your sibling and are paying for half of his medical expenses, I don\u2019t see the problem with you also being his physician. Although...\u201d he rapped his fingers over the desk as his expression soured somewhat. \"It reminds me of a similar situation that happened many years ago.\"\n\n   \"O-oh?\" Naser asked almost instinctually.\n\n   \"Yeah,\" the director continued as he leaned back on his office chair. \"Sixty years ago, there was a doctor who also claimed that he had a sibling he wanted to personally oversee. At the time, it was a bit more common, so no one really batted an eye. Then, one week later, the patient died in the middle of an operation. The cause? An accidental rupture of a major artery.\" The older dino shook his head solemnly as he moved to his computer and typed out something on it. \"The doctor in charge of the patient was promptly fired and stripped of all his medical licenses.\" The director turned to look at Naser again, only this time, much less warmly than before. \"Accidents do happen in the medical field, but it is our job as physicians to keep said accidents from becoming more than statistical anomalies. Remember our oath as doctors: share your knowledge, support the unwell and downtrodden, and do no harm.\" \n\n   Naser, unable to think or say anything in response to his boss' words, nodded in acknowledgment.\n\n   With a nod of his own, the director turned back to his computer one more time and quickly typed out something on his keyboard. Five seconds later, he hit the device's final button before again turning back to face the pterodactyl. \u201cDoctor Naser, Mr. Anon is now in your care. All that's left now is to fill out some paperwork.\u201d\n\n   Naser let out the air he had been holding in his lungs and tried to smile, only to find a part of himself unable to. Finally, through sheer force of will, he forced the corners of his mouth to rise in the closest facsimile of a smile that he could form given the maelstrom of emotion in his heart. \u201cThank you so much, Mr. Joshua.\u201d\n\n   \u201cNo problem at all, my boy. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have some more work to get done before the sun sets.\u201d\n\n   Naser gave his boss a nod and walked out of the office, closing the door behind him as gently as he could. Once he heard the mechanism click, he let out a huge sigh and hobbled towards the nearest wall.\n\n   He should have been ecstatic. He should have been celebrating the fact that his plan was finally coming to fruition. Finally, four years of misery were close to ending in a single great moment of cathartic retribution against a person who most certainly deserved it, and then some. Yet despite being so close to the finish line, Naser very suddenly felt utterly ill.\n\n   Without another word or thought from him, Naser moved towards the elevator at a brisk pace, reaching the lift one minute earlier than when he had first sought out the director. Without wasting a second on errant thoughts, he called up the machine. The instant the doors slid open, the dino stepped in, once again finding the compartment empty. As before, the silence gave the ptero mind ample chance to think over what was to happen next. It wasn't long before a voice in the back of his head screamed and begged him to stop and think about what he was planning. 'This isn't who you are,' the voice screamed into his ear. 'What's revenge going to earn you? Will it magically make Fang return home? Will it set right everything that went wrong with your friends and family? Will it really make you happy?'\n\n   Naser looked down at his shoes and brought a hand up to his face. Then, with another sigh, he leaned against the elevator's walls and closed his eyes. For the first time in four years, the rage that had given him so much purpose feel frail and petty\u2026\n\n   Naser sighed again and looked down at his hand. With a grim expression, he clenched his hands shut and grimaced with newfound determination.\n\n   It was time to end it once and for all...   \n\n \n\n   Anon opened his eyes and groggily looked at the room\u2019s clock. It was exactly one hour and one minute since Naser had so shockingly reappeared into his life. \n\n   Anon hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d ever see his ex-classmate again, but fate, it seemed, had a funny way of playing things out. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was his well-deserved lousy luck or some curse cast upon him by Neptune. If it was a curse, then it had to be because of that one time he kicked an albatross off the deck of his ship. He\u2019d been told hundreds of times by his more superstitious comrades that killing a seabird was grounds for a nautical curse. Anon being Anon though, he hadn\u2019t cared for some hookey seaman ghost story.\n\n   Now though, as he thought back to all that had happened up to his hospitalization. His accident at sea, the dreams of a better life mocking him, his spiral into substance abuse self-destruction, his seeing of Fang once again, and now Naser of all people in the world working in the same hospital he wound up in. Anon couldn\u2019t help but feel like there was something grander out there making sure he started paying all the dues he owed.\n\n   The human shut his eyes and recalled all of Naser\u2019s words to him. While he would have loved to pretend they meant nothing to him, he knew deep down that they hadn\u2019t been harsh enough. He deserved all the vitriol that Naser could conjure at him and then some more.\n\n   Anon tried to shift his body around, but then he felt something on top of his body. Turning his eyes down, he spotted Stella\u2019s head lying on top of his waist. Confused at first, he carefully slid a hand out of his covers and moved to poke one of his friends\u2019 green hair buns. He paused when he heard a snort escape from the stego's mouth. \n\n   Blinking a few times to process the scene before him, Anon followed Stella\u2019s body and noticed how she had shifted the sofa next to his bed so that it now faced his bedside rather than the room\u2019s entrance. With the new position, she was able to plop her head and chest over him more comfortably, her face directed at the door, almost as if serving like some kind of watch dog.\n\n   Anon sighed and shook his head. \u2018She pours out her heart to me, and next thing I know, she\u2019s doing something like this\u2026\u2019 \n\n   At that thought, Anon found himself struggling to piece together how Stella could like someone as socially dense as he was. \u2018And not like as a friend either,\u2019 he thought in surprise. The absolute last thing he had expected to hear that day was how Stella had liked him as more than a friend back in high school. It was a heck of a lot more than he deserved even back then. His more cynical side wanted to believe that Stella\u2019s revelation was a spur-of-the-moment type of thing. That she got her words confused with some anime quote and only wanted to make him feel good before once again departing from his life. Yet as he stared at the sleeping dino on his lap, that cynical voice was having a harder time convincing him otherwise.\n\n   The human tried to think what was it about him that Stella liked. The obvious answer would have been their shared love of anime, but Anon felt that wasn\u2019t quite the answer. Both Stella and himself hadn\u2019t exactly been the shining beacons of popularity four years ago. Could it have been their shared status as social outcasts? Stella always seemed to have a way of making others avoid her, no doubt thanks to her general awkwardness and obsession with the occult. As for Anon\u2026 aside from being the only \u2018skinny\u2019 in a school of dinos, there had also been the whole doxing incident. In fact, that damned incident had very nearly cost him his life when he took that tumble down the stairs. \u2018If it hadn\u2019t been for Fang that day\u2026\u2019\n\n   Anon paused in his tracks. He'd almost forgotten in the chaos of his last few days that there had been someone else who liked him once upon a time. Someone that, despite all their flaws and shattered outlook on their own existance, had still found it in their hearts to love him all the same... \n\n   ...At least until he fucked it all up in a drunken stupor...\n\n   Anon took another look at Stella and grimaced. A nasty taste began to fill his mouth as he realized that he didn't deserve Stella's kindness. 'After all, people don't change... so I'm only going to end up fucking things up for her...' he thought as he put a hand on the stego's shoulder. 'I deserve my current misery. No need to drag someone else down with me as well.'\n\n   Before Anon could shake Stella awake, the door to his room swung open. Almost as if startled awake by an electrical prod, Stella jumped awake, turning to face the door and once again placing herself between the human and whoever had just dared intrude into the area. As she did all that, her face twisted into a scowl and her hands curled into fists.\n\n   \"Woah!\" an orange-toned ankylosaur in a florally adorned black dress yelped, raising her hands up defensively. \"\u00a1\u00bfQue hice para enojarte, Stella?!\" Rosa shouted as she took a step backward.\n\n   Upon seeing her friend's face, Stella relaxed her pose and expression before letting out a huge sigh of relief. Before Rosa could say another word\u2014or think about anything really\u2014the stegosaur rushed forward to tightly embrace the orange dino, all the while sniffling as whatever anger she once had dissolved as happiness took over.\n\n   Rosa blinked a few times before patting Stella on the back. \"There, there, mija. Whatever's wrong, it's okay...\"\n\n   Stella nodded and broke the hug before walking back to Anon's bedside, where she again sat down on the couch and leaned back with a groan.\n\n   Rosa let out a slight chuckle as she closed the door behind her and set her eyes on Anon. The moment she did, her expression considerably brightened at seeing her old classmate awake and lucid. \n\n   \"So... An-On... it's uh...\" Rosa started, all the while rubbing the back of her head and giving the human a wide simper. \"...Ha pasado mucho tiempo... \u00bfno?\"\n\n   It takes a few moments for Anon to translate Rosa's Spanish in his head. When he does, he gives the orange dino a nod of acknowledgment but says not a word. \n\n   Rosa began fidgeting a bit with her hands, seemingly unsure of what to say or do next. Finally, after a few seconds of awkward silence, she let out a sigh and walked right up to Anon's bedside. \"May I?\" She asked the human, who considered the dino's word for an attosecond before nodding.\n\n   With Anon's blessing, Rosa sat down on the edge of the bed, careful not to sit on his leg. Only once she found a seat did she let out the breath she had been holding in her lungs and looked Anon in the eyes. \"Look, An-On... I'm... I'm having trouble trying to figure out what to say here,\" she started in an uneven voice, almost as if she was struggling to keep her tone consistent. \"I-I mean...\" She grimaced as she leaned closer to the human's face. \"\u00a1Pense que estabas muerto!\" she abruptly shouted, her eyes slightly shimmering in the sterile light of the room and her cheeks reddening from a mixture of emotion. \"Stupido! First, y-you stop going to school! Then you disappear completely! Then no one sees or hears anything from you for four years. FOUR YEARS! And then... and then you suddenly show up again... b-but all beat up and... and...\" she scowled, all the while more tears welled in her eyes. \"\u00a1\u00bfQui\u00e9nes fueron los cabrones que te malmataron?!\" she asked, her face only growing a darker shade of red. \"When I find them, I'm going shove my chancla up their asses so far up they're going to be tasting leather for at least a month!\"\n\n   Anon shifted his eyes towards Stella in the vain hope of glimpsing some kind of answer from the lime green stego. She had taken the revelation that his attackers had been none other than himself relatively well, but Stella was Stella, and she really hadn't changed much in the last four years. Rosa, on the other hand, was a completely different story. He had no idea how she would handle the revelation that the one who had beat him up had been himself. If she was still the same fiery latina he remembered, then she would beat him back into another coma, all the while holding a great deal of disappointment in him... which, frankly, he found far worse than any anger she might have towards him.\n\n   When Stella only gave Anon a warm smile and a nod, the human came to the conclusion that he might as well face the music. He just hoped that the orange fury he recalled Rosa being capable of becoming had considerably dulled over the last four years...\n\n   \"About that...\" Anon started, setting his eyes directly into Rosa's crimson orbs. Then, with a deep breath of air and what little resolution he had wrangled into place, Anon narrated to Rosa just what had happened to him. He left nothing out, from the dreams to his overindulgence in alcohol and weed, and finally to his self-inflicted injuries.\n\n   Anon could practically feel the heat rising within Rosa. With one last exhale, he closed his eyes and prepared himself to receive the beating of his life...\n\n   ...Instead, Rosa let out a sob and grabbed Anon by the shoulders, bringing him in for a tight yet gentle embrace, her head resting on top of his head as her soft brown hair draped over Anon's cranium. \"\u00a1St-stupido!\" She shouted as she tightened her grip around the human's head. \"Y-you stupid, STUPID boy! Hiding away your pain and thinking that you're all alone in the w-world!\" she let out another sob, Anon feeling something wet hit the top of his bald head. \"It's okay An-On... everything's okay... estoy aqui for you...\"\n\n   Anon sat speechlessly. In his mind, he tried to rationalize why Rosa, of all people, would be as lovingly welcoming as she was being. He hadn't precisely been friendly towards the Hispanic dino in the past. If anything, he had been rude and dismissive. Perhaps not to the same level as he had been with Stella, but certainly enough to ensure that the ankylosaur would view him as nothing less than an asshole. Yet, despite having given her every right to shun him, there she was, embracing him like he was the most precious thing in her world at that moment.\n\n   Anon couldn't handle it. He broke away from Rosa's embrace and gently pushed her away from him. \"Why?\" he asked her, unable to keep his emotion from showing. \"Why are you being so nice to me?\"\n\n   Rosa's expression soured at Anon's words. \"Why am I being so nice?\" She asked with a growing scowl on her face. \"Why am I being so nice!?\" she repeated, this time standing up from the bed and crossing her arms.\n\n   Anon glanced sideways towards Stella, who only gave Anon a cheeky little smile that more or less said, 'you've done it now.' \n\n   \"Tell me An-On, are you really so pessimistic as to think that there wouldn't be anyone happy to see you again!?\" Rosa roared at Anon in the same way that one would expect to hear from a mother scolding her child. \"I don't know what kind of appalling life you've had since dropping out of school, but I'll have you know that I NEVER once saw you as anything less than an amigo!\" She again leaned close to the human and fixed him with a harsh yet somehow caring glower. \"Si, you were often rude and distant and definitely in need of some lessons in empathy, but deep down, I knew that wasn't the real you!\" the orange dino sighed again, and her expression and tone dropped. \"The doxing incident... it was pretty shameful... but it showed to me why you were so cold and distant and unemotional and willing to distance yourself from everyone... and I'm so, SO sorry something like that happened to you...\"\n\n   Anon was now the one to grow angry, his brow furrowing as he glared at Rosa. \"Why would you be sorry about me? Why did you even give me the time of day when you knew how terrible and pathetic I really am?\"\n\n   \"BECAUSE\u2014\" Rosa shouted back, her cheeks turning a bright shade of red to match her eyes. Before she could say anything else, she shut her mouth and let out a silent yell before closing her eyes. \"Porque vi lo bueno dentro de ti...\"\n\n   \"W-what?\" Anon asked, not quite sure if he had heard correctly.\n\n   Rosa breathed and fixed Anon with a stalwart yet gentle gaze. \"The first time I met you, you were just some idiota that ruined my flowers and couldn't even plant seedlings right! Que Raptor Jesus me perdone por decir esto, but I honestly expected to hate you! Yet, the more I got to know you in those beautification weekends and beyond, the more I realized that the front of callousness you built for yourself wasn't who you really were, and I...\" she turned away from the human, the red on her cheeks growing brighter. \"...I started to think to myself... 'este hombre solo necesita una buena chica a su lado para brillar...'\" She grit her teeth and turned back to face Anon. \"I-I know it sounds stupid. Childish even! But the idea of helping you surpass all your problems and support you as you became el hombre that I knew was buried somewhere inside was...\" She again closed her eyes, a warm smile spreading across her lips. \"By my lord on his cross of rock, was it a stupid childish idea that only ni\u00f1os could come up with! Como si el amor fuera realmente asi de facil...\" \n\n   Having sat in silence as Rosa poured out her heart out to Anon, Stella now had a look on her face somewhere between extreme astonishment and dainty melancholy. She didn't quite know how to feel about her friend's revelation on her feelings for Anon back in high school. Had the stego been a more jealous woman, she would have felt some anger at the disclosure. Yet, with how heartfelt Rosa had been, the only thing she felt was understanding, as well as a sense of relief. Relief that she wasn't alone in her past feelings towards Anon.\n\n   Anon, meanwhile, could barely wrap his head around what he had just learned from Rosa. The more the human tried to make sense of it, the more it baffled him. 'With Stella, I can understand. We were and still are weebs and still are awkward. We were loners looking for friends and someone to love us. But Rosa? Rosa and I just weren't compatible in high school. She was the polar opposite of everything I strove to be!' Anon thought as he gave the orange ankylosaur a look of disbelief.\n\n   Perhaps realizing the kind of emotional bomb she had dropped on the scene\u2014or maybe thinking that the conversation was best steered elsewhere\u2014Rosa cleared her throat and turned to face Stella. \"So, bichita,\" she started, the redness of her cheeks still visible despite her best attempts to move past the moment. \"Now that we know that An-On's okay... wanna go get some food? Maybe change out of that tracksuit you've been wearing all day?\"\n\n   Stella's expression expectantly soured. \"No,\" she replied bluntly.\n\n   Rosa raised an eyebrow and shifted her head back a bit. \"No? \u00bfPor que?\"\n\n   Stella looked to Anon, her eyes again filling with the anger, sadness, and pain from earlier that day. Her sight hung over the human for about a second, during which time she seemed to debate whether she wanted\u2014or rather needed\u2014to tell her friend of the complicated situation brewing. Meanwhile, while a good part of Anon's brain told him to not do anything to encourage more grief from Stella, the human knew that in this particular case, hiding the truth wasn't in anyone's favor. Gently, he grabbed hold of Stella's hand and gave her a nod of confirmation. Before the stego could open her mouth to speak, Anon turned to face Rosa and spoke for her. \"We met Naser earlier. He's a doctor in this hospital.\"\n\n   Rosa's eyes widened as a smile formed on her lips. \"Naser's here!?\" she asked with glee. \"\u00a1Ay Dios mio! \u00a1Esto es maravilloso! That means we can all reconnect with him and see how he's doing and what he's bee\u2014\"\n\n   \"He attacked Anon!\" Stella interrupted Rosa before the ankylosaur could go any further with her statement.\n\n   Rosa's expression did a 180 in a matter of nanoseconds. Where before she looked giddy and rapturous, on hearing Stella's words, her face twisted into a scowl of anger, her very eyes suddenly glowing with fury. \"\u00bf\u00a1Hizo QUE!?\" the now-ranging orange dino shouted so loudly that it was surprising there hadn't been a nurse or some other hospital staff rushing in to see what all the commotion was about.\n\n   Stella stood up and rushed to her friend's side. \"Rosa!\" Stella started, all the while putting a hand on the ankylosaur's shoulder. \"R-remember what we talked a-about!\"\n\n   Rosa shot a glare towards Stella, but rather than grow angrier, the dino shut her eyes tight and let out several hard and steamy snorts. When at last she was no longer fuming, the ankylosaur turned her full attention to Stella. \"Tell me everything!\"\n\n   Over the next half hour, Stella and Anon took turns telling Rosa everything that had happened before her arrival. They started from Anon's miraculous awakening thanks to Stella's terrible anime openings, followed up by stegosaur's heart to heart with the human\u2014complete with a recreation of her less than adequate but still well-meaning speech quoting Kamina from Gurren Laggan\u2014to Naser's arrival and his all-encompassing resentment towards Anon. Rosa's fury reached its peak when Stella repeated all of the terrible things the pterodactyl shouted in his anger. \n\n   By the time Anon and Stella finished their tale, Rosa looked like she was ready to march out of the room to personally hunt down Naser and bring upon him the wrath of her dreaded chancla. Stella looked just as keen to bring down fire and fury upon Naser, her previous sadness now turning into a fiery sense of righteous wrath that the human couldn't deny made him\u2014for lack of a better term and most certainly taking the word from much smarter and funnier men than he was\u2014scaroused. The absurdity of having two pissed-off girls who had admitted to having once liked him as more than a friend ready and willing to go on a warpath on his behalf wasn't at all lost on him, and it only compounded his confusion and guilt. Regardless of what either Stella or Rosa thought on the matter, Anon felt he deserved every bit of Naser's wrath. Of course, he would have an easier time convincing a brick wall to move aside than convincing either of the former Volcano High garden club leaders that Naser was in the right for being so furious. Anon couldn't help but sigh in frustration. 'So much for keeping my head low and living the rest of my life as the pariah, I really am...'\n\n   Both Rosa and Stella turned to look at Anon, their eyes filled with a mixture of righteous fierceness and deep solicitude. \"We're gonna go find Naser and give him \u00a1La chancletada de su vida!\" \n\n   \"Oui!\" Stella added in her native French. \"He's soon going to learn what it means to mess with team Fleuriste!\"\n\n   Rosa turned to look at Stella with a slight frown. \"Team Fleuriste? No, no, no! That just won't do!\"\n\n   Stella deflated somewhat at hearing her friend's comment, reminding Anon of the times when he had called the lime stego a weirdo. 'Something I never really apologized for and probably should,' Anon embarrassingly thought, making a mental note for later. \n\n   \"What's wrong with Team Fleuriste?\" Stella asked meekly. \"It's a catchy name, and it fits us to a T since we're florist and whatnot.\"\n\n   \"Yeah, but that's exactly why it doesn't work,\" Rosa retorted, putting a hand on Stella's shoulder in a show of support. \"If we're going to have a team name, it has to be something that tells people '\u00a1Cuidado! \u00a1No te metas con esas chicas!'\"\n\n   Stella put her hands behind her back and under her tail in contemplation. \"I guess that is a good point...\" She set her light blue eyes on her friend's ruby eyes. \"I did think of using the name 'Stardust Crusaders,' but that would be... maybe a bit too flashy?\"\n\n   Rosa snorted out a laugh. \"That sounds like the name of an awful eighty's hair metal band.\"\n\n   \"Actually, it's from this one show called JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,\" Stella added excitedly. \"It's really cool and I think you would like it!\"\n\n   Rosa raised an eyebrow. \"JoJo? \u00bfQue tipo de nombre estupido es ese?\"\n\n   \"Actually, I'll have you know that it's an epic seven-part story abo\u2014\"\n\n   \"\u00a1Enfocate!\" Rosa shouted, curring Stella off much to Anon's endless gratitude. \"We are not using 'Stardust Crusaders' for our team name!\"\n\n   Stella puffed her cheeks and crossed her arms. \"Fine. What's your suggestion then?\" \n\n   The ankylosaur tapped her chin in contemplation for five seconds before snapping her fingers and smirking. \"Team '\u00a1Tres Estrellas!'\" Rosa almost yelled out, all the while flexing her arm with a wide grin on her lips.\n\n   Anon, with a raised eyebrow, was the one to speak this time. \"Team 'Three Stars'?\" he asked in a deadpan tone. \"What does that even imply?\" \n\n   Rosa, smiling broadly, turned to face Anon. \"Si!\" she replied, all the while still fleshing her arm. \"There are tres people here: Me, Stella, and you. One star for each of us!\n\n   Anon put a hand on the bridge of his nose. \"Please tell me this isn't a reference to\u2014\"\n\n   \"Dragon Ball Zeta!\" Rosa practically roared, interrupting Anon's words. \n\n   On hearing Rosa's explanation why she wanted to use the name 'three stars' for their hypothetical team, Anon very much wanted to unhook the IV still attached to his arm and use it as a makeshift noose. 'As if one weeb wasn't enough, now I find out that Rosa of all people likes DBZ...' The human then paused for a second as realization hit him and chuckled once he really gave it a good think-over. Of course, Rosa would share at least one interest with Stella, and DBZ was unequivocally popular in Latin countries. Even so, he never pegged the orange florist for being a big enough fan to reveal her power level so casually. 'Learn something new every day, I guess,' Anon thought, wondering just what other revelation he would be witness to that day...\n\n   Just then, and almost as if his thoughts tempted some sort of mischievous trickster god out to make everyone's life all the more confusing, Naser opened the door and stepped into the room. As he did, he again fixed Anon with a glare. Yet, it was nowhere near as nasty as it had been earlier. It felt forced, like something he struggled to maintain despite his mind and spirit being in entirely different places.\n\n   Stella wasted no time in once again stepping in front of Naser's sight, almost as if the presence of her actuality would somehow keep Naser from recognizing Anon was even lying on the bed. Rosa, meanwhile, turned beet red as she marched up to the pterodactyl and looked up into his eyes with a scornful glower that embodied the old saying, 'if looks could kill...'\n\n   Naser let out a scoff as he returned the orange dino's death glare. \"Good to see you too, Rosa.\"\n\n   Rosa responded to Naser's words with a slap across his face, the speed and fierceness of the blow causing the ptero to stagger back as he put a hand on his cheek. \"\u00a1Eso es por lastimar a Anon,\" Rosa hissed through clenched teeth.\n\n   Naser, after recovering some of his composure, glowered at Rosa before allowing himself an exhale. He then straightened his posture and adjusted his white coat. \"Okay. I deserved that,\" he muttered just loud enough for everyone present in the room to hear. \"Glad to know you're still as fit as I remember,\" the dino addressed Rosa with a mixture of sentimentality and comfort. He turned to face Stella, a tiny grin forming on his lips. \"My guess is that you also want to hit me.\"\n\n   \"I'm VERY tempted to!\" Stella snapped at Naser, her body refusing to budge from her defensive position over Anon's bed.\n\n   As he turned to look between Stella and Rosa, Naser couldn't help but feel great resentment. He turned his full attention to Rosa, who he viewed as the more physically imposing of the trio in the room. \"Why are you taking Anon's side,\" he asked, his voice astringent yet shockingly lax despite the current situation. \"You know very well what he did.\"\n\n   Rosa rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. \"Si. I know what happened between Anon and Fang. Y si, I know exactly what it led up to.\"\n\n   Naser's brow furrowed as he took a step closer towards Rosa. \"If you know the truth, then why in the name of Raptor Jesus are you protecting him?\"\n\n   \"Because...\" Rosa started, giving Anon a glance before turning her attention back on Naser. \"...Because I believe in An-On!\" the ankylosaur said as she took a step forward, all the while keeping her glare squarely on her former classmate. \"Because he's suffered just as much as you have. Because despite having a ticket to anywhere in the world, he came back to us!\"\n\n   \"So he returned to the scene of his crime! That doesn't mean he's sorry or that he's changed!\"\n\n   \"\u00bfY tu que sabes sobre cambio?\" Rosa asked at the top of his lungs.\n\n   Naser paused his thoughts in his tracks as Rosa's question pierced through all his mental defenses. Try as he might, the question rattled in his head as he the pterosaur tried\u2014and failed\u2014to plan some sort of retort. \n\n   He had changed, yes, but for all the worst reasons... \n\n   The once bright and all-around honor student of Volcano High had forced himself to become a friendless, spite-fueled doctor who took the first job that he could in Volcadra Bluffs not because it was what he wanted, but because it was what he felt he needed to do. Whereas he would have once gone for a higher sense of purpose with his career, he instead settled for the bare minimum, not caring that refusing to chase the greatness that so many had once seen in him killed his very soul. And what was worse, the anger and hatred of Anon\u2014someone he had once considered a good friend\u2014drove him to consider breaking his oath as a doctor... \n\n   Was that all that he really was? A bitter man willing to throw anything and everything away in search of revenge that at best would prove hollow and at worst would leave him no better than Anon was?\n\n   \"I... I...\" Naser mumbled as he attempted to form words in his mouth. With a grunt, he turned away from everyone's eyes and hit the nearest wall with his fist. The ptero then hit the wall again and then a third time. When he moved to hit the wall a fourth time, he abruptly stopped and let his first hover over the wall for a second before opening up his palm and placing his open hand on the wall. Less than a second later, he let his whole body sag.\n\n   Naser suddenly felt a hand rest upon his shoulder. Naser perked his head and glanced at the extremity placed upon his being, expecting it to be orange or lime-green in tone. Instead, it was pink and distinctively scaleless.\n\n   Slowly, the ptero turned to face the owner of the hand, who was none other than Anon. Despite still being weak of body and sporting a battered, bandaged face, the human had risen from his bed, IV stand in hand and a look that held so many emotions contained within\u2014from sorrow, to understanding, to grim determination\u2014and had walked up to the one person in the world that had both the strength and desire to kill him.\n\n   \"Naser...\" Anon started in as gentle a voice as he could summon. \"I... I know I don't deserve to speak to you...\" he glanced towards Rosa and Stella, both of whom stood by with stunned looks on their faces. \"I don't deserve to direct even a single word at any of you...\" he turned back to face Naser, all the while maintaining his hand on his shoulder. \"...But I have to say this...\"\n\n   Naser said nothing to the human, only fixing him with a tired glare.\n\n   Anon took a deep breath and grimly looked on at his former classmate and friend. \"I... I know I fucked up. Fucked up real bad. I know what I did to your sister that night led to so many people losing their way... and not a single day has passed by since then that I don't regret my choice to run away from the world like a bitch...\" The human removed his hand from the ptero's shoulder. \"I'm... I'm done running. I'm done hiding and letting life pass me by because I'm a little cowardly bitch who can own up to his mistakes as a man would. I know my word probably means little to you... but I can at the very least promise that I'll find a way to set it all right. Even if it means I have to sacrifice everything I have left, I WILL fix my fuck-up...\"\n\n   Naser looked deep into Anon's eyes. At first, he was convinced the human was playing some kind of joke on him; that he was lying to find another way to hurt him more. But the deeper the dino gazed into the human's eyes, the more evident it became that Anon wasn't lying...\n\n   The pterosaur let out another bitter chuckle and he stepped back from the human and right into the wall. \"Anon... your promise doesn't even matter...\" tears shimmered in Naser's eyes as he began taking uneven and raspy breaths. \"Fang's... gone. No one's seen them... in four years. I... I don't even know if they are still alive...\" \n\n   At Anon's words, the dam finally broke for Naser. A bitter waterfall began streaming down the ptero's face, one whose flow he couldn't halt no matter how many times he wiped his eyes. As the dino stared into the human's eyes, his expression changed from grief to wrath, to confusion, and finally into a near-incomprehensible rage. Almost instinctually, and without any warning, the ptero reached up for Anon's throat, both hands wrapping themselves around the human's neck and squeezing down with such intensity that the skin slowly began turning purple. \n\n   Stella and Rosa's very breath left their lungs as they saw Naser's actions. The two began rushing forward, only to stop when they saw Anon gazing on at them shaking his head despite the tears of agony forming in his eyes\u2026\n\n   Naser's lips turned into a grin as he began squeezing tighter and tighter. He had the hated human where he wanted him, his hands slowly and painfully squeezing the life out of his hated enemy. 'Fang, this is for you. Your big brother's going to get payback for you. This is what you'd want...' \n\n   '...Right...?'\n\n   Naser's mind stopped for a second as his own words rebounded within his skull. Little by little, he realized where his hands were and what he was doing, at which point another voice, one far older and wiser than his, echoed in his mind...\n\n   *'Share your knowledge, support the unwell and downtrodden, and do no harm.'*\n\n   'Do no harm,' Naser thought to himself as he looked down at his hands still gripped around Anon's neck. \"Do no harm...\" he whispered just barely audibly enough for both his ears and Anon's. The ptero looked up at the human's eyes, only to realize they were slowly rolling upwards into the back of his eye sockets. He was so close. Just another squeeze and Anon's neck would snap...\n\n   Realization hit Naser like a bag of bricks, and his hateful rage turned to shame. 'I'm killing Anon...' he thought as more tears formed in his eyes. 'I'm... I'm killing my old friend...'\n\n   Naser released Anon from his grip and put his hands on the human's shoulders. Anon, meanwhile, breathed a great sigh of relief as he tried his best not to cough away the pain in his neck. The ptero slowly looked up into the human's eyes again, a stinging smile plastered on his lips. It seemed as if he needed to say something... but whatever those words may have been, they were lost when he began sobbing. A full minute passed with the dino neither able to speak or stop crying. Only when the ptero felt he had expunged every last tear in his system, he patted Anon on the shoulder and began walking towards the door. \"I'm a failure. As a man, a brother, and a friend,\" he whispered without so much as meeting anyone's gaze. \"I'm... sorry. For... everything...\"\n\n   Anon ran a hand over the quickly bruising spot on his neck and put on a determined face. \"Naser!\" he called out just as the ptero reached for the door. \"Fang is alive.\"\n\n   Naser stopped in his tracks and slowly turned to face Anon with eyes open wide. \"W-what d-did you say?\" he wearily asked in a coarse voice.\n\n   \"Fang is alive,\" Anon repeated, his own voice turning raspy. \"I saw them two weeks ago. They're still in Volcadera Bluffs. Somewhere.\"\n\n   Naser put a hand over his mouth and staggered backward once again. The moment he hit a solid surface, he began sliding down onto the floor. Thirty seconds went by where the entire room was silent except for the sound of Naser's heart furiously beating. Then, very gently, the pterodactyl began to chuckle. It was quiet and faint at first, but gradually, the laughter turned louder and more ardent. In the expanse of thirty seconds, the dino laugher turned to bewailings. Unlike his last cries, though, there was a hint of joy in these new sounds. Perhaps the first bit of genuine joy he had experienced over the previous four years. Before he could stop himself, Naser broke into full-on wails. \n\n   Naser\u2019s howls weren't those of sorrow or defeat or incredible loss, however...","encoded":false},"A Better End Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Multiple","A Better End Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"   Chapter 4 - The Chariot\n\n   \u201cLucy\u2019s alive\u2026\u201d Naser told himself for what must have been the hundredth time that morning. \u201cShe\u2019s... alive\u2026 h-holy shit\u2026\u201d \n\n   The young doctor barely got any sleep last night. The news of his sister\u2019s continuance made sure of that. At most, he got maybe an hour\u2019s worth of slumber in his office before the restlessness snapped him back into the waking world. Since then, he had wandered the halls of the hospital like a specter, occasionally doing the work expected of him as a physician but mostly hovering somewhere between lucidity and unclarity. As night turned to dawn, he had found his mind wandering too much. Grabbing several cups worth of espresso, he had excused himself to the hospital\u2019s rooftop to get fresh air and hopefully get his thoughts back on track. Unfortunately for him, fresh air brought him neither peace nor clarity of mind. The coffee kept him wide awake, yes, but wakefulness proved to be more a curse than a blessing.\n\n   Naser walks past the small communal area used by patients and staff alike, past the helicopter landing pad used for the offloading of critically injured patients or the occasional CEO visiting them, and towards one of the edges overlooking the city of Volcaldera. Downing the last of his espresso and crushing the paper cup in his hand, and letting it get carried off by the wind, the ptero cast his gaze towards the cityscape. As he did, he feels his brows crease as something in his chest starts to burn. \u201cShe\u2019s out there somewhere,\u201d he whispers, grabbing the railing with both hands and grasping the metal with enough force to make his knuckles go white. \u201cShe\u2019s out there\u2026 and only Anon knows where\u2026\u201d He shuts his eyes, grits his teeth, and hisses furiously as his grip on the rails tightens. \u201cANON!!\u201d he screams at the top of his lungs.\n\n   Naser breathes raggedly as he allows the anger in him to bubble over. For a moment, he expects to think of terrible things to do to the caveman who had caused him and his family so much vexation for four years. But as he feels the anger boil again, Naser realizes that his rage isn\u2019t aimed at his former friend...\n\n   Naser lets go of the railing and brings his shaky hands up to his eyes. In his palms, he can still feel the memory of Anon\u2019s smooth skin pressed against his scales as his digits wrapped around his once good friend\u2019s neck, squeezing to snuff out his life. The shame grows again in the ptero\u2019s heart as he realizes how close and how willing he had been to kill his old friend. The guilt only grows as he remembers that he is supposed to be the very antithesis of death. His hands were pledged to protect and nurture life, not take it away...\n\n   \u2018What kind of doctor am I?\u2019 Naser woefully ponders as he shuffles towards the nearest bench. As he takes a seat, he shifts his thoughts away from his attempted malpractice. Instead, he focuses on the good that had come out of the ordeal and the reason why even if he was still angry at Anon, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to hate him anymore\u2026\n\n   \u2018Lucy. He saw her. He confirmed she\u2019s still kicking. After all these years, she's still alive\u2026\u201d He whispers, a smile spreading across his lips as tears once again well in his eyes. Sweet memories of his sister\u2019s antics play in his mind as the young doctor does his best to every good time he shared with Lucy. He stops himself before the bad memories can fully flow. He wants only to feel the joy of that moment, even if a big part of his soul\u2019s telling him that he doesn\u2019t deserve it. \n\n   Not after\u2026\n\n   \u201cDoctor Naser. There you are.\u201d a voice snaps the young ptero out of his thoughtfulness before the bad memories can take complete control over him. \u201cBeen looking all over the hospital for you,\u201d Director Joshua, Volcadera Bluffs General\u2019s head doctor, and Naser\u2019s topmost boss says before walking up to greet his junior. He hasn\u2019t taken more than a dozen steps before he notices Naser\u2019s troubled expression. Soon as he does, he slows his pace and takes a deep breath. \n\n   Without saying a word, he walks past his junior. He turns his attention to admiring the morning scenery on the horizon instead. \u201cBeautiful morning we\u2019re experiencing today, aren\u2019t we?\u201d He asks in a melodious, sagely tone.\n\n   \u201cYes, Mr. Joshua,\u201d Naser says before letting out a sniff and wiping his eyes clear. He then takes a deep breath and slaps himself on the cheeks to psyche himself up.\n\n   The elder archelon nods as he turns to face Naser. \u201cYou holding up okay?\u201d he asks in as gentle a voice as he can muster.\n\n   Naser nods and smiles at his boss. \u201cI\u2026 I just had a rough night.\u201d\n\n   \u201cSo I hear,\u201d Doctor Joshua replies as he walks up to stand right beside Naser\u2019s bench. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d he asked, pointing to the spot next to the ptero.\n\n   Naser shakes his head and scoots over, giving his boss more than enough room to take a seat.\n\n   \u201cYou didn\u2019t go home last night at all, did you?\u201d\n\n   \u201cN-no,\u201d Naser answers intermittently.\n\n   \u201cWere you that worried about your brother?\u201d The director asks, all the while smiling warmly at Naser. \u201cHe should be well and ready to be dismissed later today if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d\n\n   Naser nods and tries to give his boss a warm and confident smile. Instead, he finds his lips unable to maintain any sort of smile for more than a few seconds.\n\n   Doctor Joshua sighs and removes his glasses, bringing out a small handkerchief and proceeding to wipe his glasses clean. \u201cSomething else\u2019s on your mind, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the elder dino asks as he continues wiping the lenses of any blemishes.\n\n   Naser shuts his eyes and stands up from the bench. The mixture of excitement, regret, joy, and sorrow almost causes his body to go haywire.\n\n   \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Joshua. It\u2019s just that I\u2026 I recently found out from none other than my b-brother that my\u2014our\u2014sister\u2026 is still alive!\u201d\n\n   Dr. Joshua\u2019s eyes lit up with genuine excitement. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news!\u201d\n\n   Naser rubs his head and begins pacing back and forth impatiently. \u201cYes, absolutely wonderful\u2026 except that I haven\u2019t seen her in four years, a-and we didn\u2019t leave on the best of terms\u2026 and also our parents may or may not hate us for\u2026\u201d Naser stops at that thought and grabs his head with both hands, all the while letting out a groan of pain. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to feel right now! I want to be ecstatic that a family member I was convinced was dead for the last four years is alive. At the same time, I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s been up to or if she even remembers me or if she WANTS to remember me. There\u2019s also the problem that only my brother knows where she is, and we have to go and find her, and then our parents will get involved and who knows how they\u2019ll react a\u2014\u201d\n\n   \u201cDoctor Naser,\u201d Director Joshua snaps in a stern yet comforting voice. \u201cYou are making a mountain out of a molehill here. You have to relax, take a deep breath, and roll with the punches that life\u2019s dealing you.\u201d He stands and walks up to the young doctor, all the while looking deep into his eyes with a wisdom that only decades of life experience can bring. \u201cPart of living is learning how to adapt to all the surprises life brings us.\u201d he puts a hand on the young ptero\u2019s shoulder and gives him a sage grin. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to work hard, adapt where necessary, and never give up on yourself and those you care about, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t achieve.\u201d   \n\n   The elder dino taps Naser on the shoulder a few times before walking past him. Naser follows his boss with his gaze, the archelon's words ringing in his head and helping dispel much of his previous unease.\n\n   \u201cDoctor Naser,\u201d Director Joshua suddenly starts, snapping the young ptero\u2019s attention back to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a rough time with your brother and now with your sister by the sounds of it. So after you complete this morning\u2019s tasks and discharge your sibling, I\u2019m giving you the rest of the week off, barring an extreme emergency, of course.\u201d\n\n   \u201cW-what?\u201d Naser stutters his question, completely dumbfounded by his boss\u2019 words.\n\n   Director Joshua only guffaws at his junior's reaction. \u201cGo help your brother. Reconcile with your sister. Get some actual sleep and stop drinking so much espresso. That stuff\u2019s not good for you young'uns,\u201d the elder dino commands, all the while adjusting his glasses.\n\n   \u201cBu-but\u2014\u201d\n\n   Director Joshua raises a hand, stopping Naser\u2019s words before he can fully form them. \u201cDoctor\u2019s orders,\u201d he says before allowing himself another hearty laugh. \u201cNow, if you excuse me, I have a nice hearty breakfast with the missus waiting for me. See you in a week!\u201d\n\n   Naser can only watch in utter dumbfoundment as his boss leaves the roof the same way he had come.\n\n   Perhaps for the first time in the last day and a half, Naser felt what he needed to do next. His emotions weren\u2019t all settled yet, but he at least knew with which foot he needed to start walking.\n\n   That was far more than he\u2019d known in the last four years. \n\n \n\n   A few hours after his rooftop situation, Naser walks down the hospital hall. As he does, he looks down at the clipboard in his hand. He scans the name printed in the standard type-font Volcaldera General used on all their paperwork: \n\n   \u2018Anon Y. Mous - Discharge approved by Dr. Naser Aaran.\u2019 \n\n   The pterodactyl can hardly still believe where he was going and for what purpose. He hated Anon\u2019s guts a day prior and wanted nothing more than to strangle him and leave him dead in some ditch somewhere. \n\n   Of course, it was a morbid form of thinking, one that a doctor shouldn\u2019t even consider in the first place. \u201cSo stop thinking like that,\u201d Naser snaps at himself during a rare moment when there aren\u2019t other members of his hospital\u2019s staff within earshot. \u201cFocus on the here and now.\u201d\n\n   The here and now\u2026 now that was another can of worms Naser still can\u2019t wrap his head around. Barely one week back in Volcaldera, and he had already found the person that for the last four years had kept the fire of hate burning in his soul. Yet not one day after meeting him, all of that hate had been snuffed out at the revelation that person had brought with them...\n\n   Naser still wanted to hate Anon. A part of him felt like he needed that hate to keep going, much like how a junkie needs their next hit of drugs. Yet, just like an addict, breaking the dependency was the best thing to do. In his case, letting go of the hate had led to him seeing things differently. Now for the first time in what felt like forever, he felt a sense of hope. That absolution could be around the corner. It still didn\u2019t change the fact that he found his situation surreal... like something out of a Twilight Zone episode.\n\n   Naser picks up his pace and reaches Anon\u2019s room. Without so much as a knock, he opens the door and walks in. Thankfully for Naser, Anon\u2019s already dressed in the same attire he was found in, only clean of filth. The only sign left on the human now that showed he had suffered physical harm were the white bandages dotted across his face.  \n\n   On seeing the human wearing his plain black turtleneck, navy blue pants, and black wool beanie, Naser can't help but feel a sense of longing for the old. Somehow, he imagined that Anon would still be wearing the same outfit he had donned in high school, even four years later. Seeing his new wardrobe was a sobering reminder of how long a time four years were. At the same time, he also wondered if Anon\u2019s spartan fashion style resulted from his time in the navy or if it was personal taste.\n\n   Naser walked up to the caveman and fixed him with his most professional gaze. Last he checked, he was still a doctor, even if he had come dangerously close to throwing all that away a day earlier. Whatever other feelings he might have for the human still, he was now his physician first and foremost.\n\n   \u201cWell, Anon, aside from the lacerations to your face, you're fully detoxed and have suffered no permanent brain damage. That means that as your physician, I can officially discharge you\u2026 on the condition that you don\u2019t drink or smoke or do anything stupid, harmful, or stupidly harmful to yourself for at least a month.\u201d\n\n   Naser finishes his word in stunned surprise. He had expected his every word to taste like vile, but now that he was more or less on good terms with Anon, it felt like he was trying to care for an old friend. Granted, the human was an old friend. It so happened that he did something that he found unforgivable. But whatever beef he might still have with the petite caveman no longer mattered. Anon had given him hope of seeing his little sister again. Hope he had all but given up on years ago.\n\n   Despite being given the go-ahead to leave, Anon couldn\u2019t find it in himself to move an inch. Something kept his feet rooted to the ground. It was almost as if some invisible weight still lingered over him. He reaches into his pocket to instinctively search for a cigarette, only to realize that he has none on his person. He can\u2019t help but grumble at his little blunder, his shoulders dropping and his brow furrowing in mild agitation.\n\n   Naser takes notice and raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n   Anon sighs. \u201cI\u2019m so used to smoking away what ails me that not being able to\u2026 fucking sucks.\u201d\n\n   Naser lets out a single chuckle and puts the clipboard under his arm. \u201cCry me a river,\u201d Naser replies with a mocking grin. \u201cI\u2019m surprised we didn\u2019t find lung cancer or some other fucked up shit in you after all those years of smoking and drinking.\u201d\n\n   Anon lets out a grumble, his disposition dropping further. \u201cI\u2019ve only been smoking hard for the last few weeks. Fucking navy doesn\u2019t allow smoking on their ships, especially the warships.\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s eyes broadened. \u201cSo you were stationed on a legit warship? And here I thought you wound up in some dinghy.\u201d\n\n   Anon shakes his head. \u201cI wish. I wound up in an aircraft carrier. I spent most of my days around live munitions and jet fuel.\u201d The human put on an exhausted smile. \u201cYou can imagine what would have happened if I smoked around that?\u201d\n\n   Naser has a few flashes to old WW2 movies he saw when he was younger where ships exploded left and right. It makes him cringe a bit, imagining such fireballs caused by a smoking sailor.\n\n   Putting that image out of his mind, Naser instead turns his thoughts to a question that's been burning him since finding out Anon had joined the navy. \u201cWhat exactly did you do in the navy?\u201d\n\n   Anon fidgets his body around before letting out a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably seen my record by now. Might as well come clean.\u201d He walks up to the sofa chair Stella had been using hours earlier and takes a seat, all the while keeping his eyes square on Naser. \u201cAfter I dropped out of High School, I had no real prospects in life. My dad only paid for the Skin Row apartment for four months extra after I graduated high school. After that, it was either college or the service. Since I dropped out, I naturally chose the service.\u201d\n\n   \u201cWhy the navy, though?\u201d Naser asks.\n\n   \u201cBecause the navy was the only armed branch that was willing to give a high school dropout like me a chance. Also, a lot of the ships want small-stature people. Me being a literal runt of a human was perfect for \u2018em.\u201d Anon bitterly laughs as he stretches his arms upwards. \u201cAlso, the navy got me the fuck out of Volcaldera. I was at boot camp within the week. After surviving that wonderful experience, I was stuffed into a carrier and sent to sail the seas for four years. It would have been five had it not been for my accident on those stairwells.\u201d\n\n   \u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me what you did in the navy,\u201d Naser comments impatiently.\n\n   Anon grimaces and shoots a glare towards Naser. \u201cI\u2019m getting there. I\u2019m getting there!\u201d He let out a snort and continued. \u201cAnyway. Once I was a full-fledged seaman\u2014don\u2019t you dare fucking laugh!\u2014\u201d Anon barks and points a finger towards Naser, who only raises a hand in a sign of peace \u201c\u2014I joined the PACT program so I could get myself some engineering know-how. Aside from that, they taught me a bunch of other stuff you\u2019d expect to learn on a warship: munition loading, electrical know-how, survival training, physical conditioning, and over a hundred ways to clean a ship with only a toothbrush and seawater.\" \n\n   \"That sounds...\" Naser started but found he had no accurate quip regarding that last thing Anon mentioned. \"...Interesting,\" he only said before shaking his head. \n\n   Anon let out another chuckle. \"The one thing I didn\u2019t expect to learn was the glorious art of CQC. Guess they wanted us fit and ready to fight off pirates or some bullshit like that.\u201d\n\n   \u201cCQC?\u201d Naser asks.\n\n   \u201cClose Quarter Combat,\u201d Anon replies with yet another tired sigh. \u201cHow to fight hand to hand and with certain tools like knives. If you\u2019ve seen MMA, it\u2019s kinda like that, only a hell of a lot less flashy and more deadly.\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s eyes swell again. \u201cWait a second then,\u201d he looks at Anon with a bewildered stare. \u201cAre telling me that back when I was\u2026 strangling you, you could\u2019ve\u2014\u201d\n\n   \u201c\u2014Reversed your choke and snapped your neck several dozen ways? Probably,\u201d Anon finishes Naser\u2019s words with a bitter grin on his lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t because\u2026 a part of me knew I deserved that strangling. Plus\u2026\u201d Anon looks at Naser with a soft gaze. \u201cI\u2026 I guess I trusted you enough not to kill me.\u201d\n\n   Naser blinks a few times, almost as if his brain was having a hard time processing the information it had received.\n\n   \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Anon suddenly asks, breaking his train of thought. \u201cWhat has the prodigal son of the Aaran\u2019s been up to these last four years?\u201d\n\n   Naser visibly flinches at Anon\u2019s words, but he does his best to keep a scowl from forming on his face. \u201cI went straight to medical school as soon as I graduated. I didn\u2019t give myself any breaks or anything.\u201d\n\n   Anon raises an eyebrow and lets out a whistle. \u201cDamn, and here I thought you\u2019d propose to Naomi or something. How\u2019s she, by the way?\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s expression darkens. His only reply is to look down to the floor.\n\n   Anon catches the mood right away and shakes his head. \u201cFuck. That bad, huh?\u201d\n\n   \u201cNaomi and I\u2026\u201d Naser starts but stops himself. He takes a deep breath and forces a smirk on his lips. \u201cNaomi and I went our separate ways shortly after graduation.\u201d\n\n   Anon raised an eyebrow in response. \u201cShe dumped you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n   Naser puts a hand on his face and shakes his head. \u201cDamn\u2026 Is it that obvious?\u201d\n\n   Anon shrugs and gives his old friend a warm yet sour smile. \u201cA bit. Though I\u2019m mostly going by the fact that Naomi was a bitch.\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s surprised to hear the words come out of Anon\u2019s mouth. A part of him wants to punch the human for even daring to say such a thing about his ex, but deep down, he knows his old friend\u2014turned one-sided enemy, and now back to a friend\u2014is correct.\n\n   Anon leans back on his chair and lets out a chuckle. \u201cDid you know that Naomi tried to set Fang and me up back in the day?\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s shoulders slump a bit at Anon\u2019s words. Some part of him had always suspected, but he never dared to accept it for fear of what it would mean. But hearing it from Anon all but made it an irrefutable fact, and it stung at his soul.\n\n   \u201cI\u2026 I guess I suspected it\u2026\u201d Naser answers meekly.\n\n   \u201cNaomi thought that if Fang and I dated, your sister would magically get \u2018fixed\u2019 of all her problems or some idiotic bullcrap that only Naomi could think up. Barring that, that our dating would keep Fang from bothering you so much. That bitch Naomi could then have you all to herself to do as she pleased.\u201d Anon sat back up and looked at Naser with sunken, tired eyes. \u201cToo bad she picked me to date your sister. I was probably the worst person she could have chosen for the job..\u201d\n\n   Naser wanted to say something in rebuttal to Anon\u2019s words, but harsh as they were, his words rang true. Naomi had shown her true colors in the end, and everyone fell into her ploy without any means of seeing the truth until it was far too late. Anon may have been responsible for breaking Fang\u2019s heart, but that only happened because Naomi forced them together in the first place. Still, as bad as things got in the end for them, Naser knew that Anon and Fang had shared a connection. They had enjoyed good times and had made each other happy. At least before their apocalyptic break-up. \n\n   While Naser didn\u2019t believe in multiple universes, he hoped to god that there was a reality out there where everything turned out alright and that Anon and Lucy had found some semblance of a happily ever after...\n\n   The room goes quiet for about a full minute. After that minute passes, Naser walks up to the now-empty medical bed and sits down, setting the clipboard to the side as he staring deep into Anon\u2019s eyes.\n\n   \u201cAnon, I\u2019ve already told you that I believe you about Lucy, but I need to know the truth. Did you really see her a week ago?\u201d\n\n   \u201cYes. I really did.\u201d\n\n   \u201cW-where!?\u201d Naser asks in more of a panic.\n\n   \u201cShe was playing in some shitty pizzeria called \u2018Pizza Time\u2019 back in Skin Row.\u201d\n\n   \u201cW-what did she look like? Was she well-fed? Was she thin? D-did she still have all her extremities attached!?\u201d\n\n   At the question, Anon hesitates. He doesn\u2019t want to break Naser\u2019s spirit any more, but something tells him that lying about Fang\u2019s physical state wouldn\u2019t help anyone. \u2018Naser deserves to know the truth too\u2026\u2019 the human reasons as he decides he\u2019s done keeping things from others.\n\n   \u201cFang, she\u2026 she looked thin. Malnourished, even. She had this gaunt look to her like the last four years have worn down her spirit to the point where she\u2019s more of an automaton animated by neurotransmitters than a person...\u201d Anon sighs as the bitter memories of the day he had failed for the second time in his life flood back in. \u201cShe\u2026 she literally looked right through me, as if I wasn\u2019t even there, and I was sitting so close to that stage\u2026\u201d He gives Naser a look full of regret. \u201cI\u2026 know I said she was still alive, but the way she looked\u2026 I would say that only applies to her physically\u2026\u201d\n\n   Naser Stands up and glares daggers at Anon. For a few moments, the fires of hatred again ignite within the ptero\u2019s soul. For the faintest of moments, he considers cursing out Anon for what he did, how his actions led to Fang\u2019s current state of living death\u2026 but that fire dies as quickly as it ignited as the young doctor remembers Anon\u2019s words the last time they met.\n\n   Instead of punching the human as he originally wanted, Naser winds up grabbing anon by the sides of his shirt and forcing him to stand up, so the two are eye to eye with one another. \n\n   \u201cYou saw Lucy looking like that and just walked away!?\u201d Naser shouts at Anon\u2019s face. \u201cWhat is wrong with you!?\u201d\n\n   Anon shifts his eyes to the side, his expression dropping as he silently agrees with Naser\u2019s assessment of him.\n\n   \u201cW-well!\u201d Naser shouts, all the while shaking Anon. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say!?\u201d \n\n   Naser\u2019s brow only furrows when Anon gives him no answer.\n\n   \u201cNo,\u201d Anon whispers in reply.\n\n   Naser lets go of the human and takes a step back, his eyes shimmering as tears begin welling in them.\n\n   \u201cI know\u2026 that what I did was cowardly,\" Anon finally says as he sets his eyes on his friend's teary gaze. \"I don\u2019t need a reminder of that. I\u2019ve had a whole week to think back on how I once again ran away instead of facing my mistakes like a fucking man. But like I told you, I\u2019m done running, and I\u2019m done being a little bitch about it!\u201d Anon puts a hand on Naser\u2019s shoulder and gives him a dead-serious look. \u201cSoon as I\u2019m out of this hospital, I\u2019m going to go find Fang, and I\u2019m going to do what I should've done a week ago!\u201d\n\n   Naser breathed deep and returned Anon\u2019s intense gaze. \u201cY-you better,\u201d he says with some resentment, yet also with hope.\n\n   Anon tightens his grip on Naser\u2019s shoulder, prompting the ptero\u2019s eyes to widen a bit. \u201cYou should come with me,\u201d the human says, a faint smile forming on his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re Fang\u2019s brother too. She\u2014they\u2014deserve to know that you\u2019re still out here caring about their wellbeing, even after being gone for years.\u201d\n\n   \u201cW-what?\u201d Naser asked, stuttering as his brain tried comprehending Anon\u2019s words.\n\n   \u201cCome with me to Pizza Time or wherever else she\u2019s going to be playing next. We\u2019ll meet her together, and together we\u2019ll let her know that there are people who still care!\u201d Anon put his other hand on Naser\u2019s shoulder and brought him close enough that the two were only inches away from bumping noses. \u201cIf you\u2019re there, you two can reconnect and be family again. I mean, it\u2019s what you want, right?\u201d \n\n   Naser takes a step away from Anon and turns away from the human. As he does, his shoulders sag, and his head slumps forward. Not one second later, the young doctor\u2019s body begins to tremble, almost as if someone turned his blood ice-cold.\n\n   \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can do that, Anon\u2026\u201d\n\n   \u201cWhat?\u201d Anon asks in shock.\n\n   Naser turns around, his eyes now sporting tears ready to roll down his cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do that!\u201d he shouts.\n\n   \u201cWhat\u2019d you mean that you can\u2019t do it?\u201d\n\n   Naser shut his eyes and grits his teeth. \u201cI can\u2019t do it because\u2026 because\u2026\u201d he brings up his sleeve and rubs his eyes before fixing Anon with a glare. \u201cBecause I\u2019m also a fucking coward!\u201d\n\n   Anon doesn\u2019t say anything as Naser tries his best to compose himself, all the while the scowl on his face slowly gives way to a frown full of shame. \u201cI also ran away from everything!\u201d he snaps in a rage that isn\u2019t entirely directed at Anon despite his eyes fixing themselves firmly on the human\u2019s eyes. \u201cI chose to separate myself from this place and everyone I grew up with because I couldn\u2019t handle the stress, the pain, the responsibility that I had to\u2014needed to\u2014find Lucy!\u201d He sniffs and again tries to wipe his eyes clear of tears. \u201cI even turned my back on my parents in their time of greatest need\u2026\u201d He clutched his hands tight, all the while scowling more and more furiously. \u201cHow can I possibly face Lucy when I haven\u2019t even grown the spine to face my own mother and father!?\u201d He slams his fists on Anon\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat kind of brother does that? What kind of person deserves to reconcile with a sibling when he can\u2019t even bring himself to reconcile with his parents!?\u201d  \n\n   Anon\u2019s reminded of Fang\u2019s emotional outburst back on the roof of Volcano High all those years ago. Just like he did then, he keeps his mouth shut. Not because he didn\u2019t have anything to say, he had plenty to. Rather, because something told him that Naser, much like Fang had back then, didn\u2019t need anyone patronizing or to have other's ideals forced upon them. \n\n   Naser needed someone to support him in his greatest time of need.\n\n   \u2018He needs someone better than shitty ol\u2019 me, though,\u2019 Anon thinks as he grapples with what to do next. He knows he\u2019s not the ideal person to be giving support to anyone. But given the lack of people qualified for it, he was the nearest person who realistically could. At the same time, he was also dealing with a person who had thrived off hating him for the last four years. Hell, he had tried to kill him. His sudden change of heart notwithstanding, how did one go about supporting such a person?\n\n   \u2018I guess the first thing he needs to do is bury the hatchet with his parents,\u2019 Anon reasoned. Of course, that was also true about him. It was clear that Fang\u2019s disappearance had also affected the Aarans in ways that younger Anon could have never have hoped to comprehend. Yet apologizing to Fang\u2019s parents was a terrifying prospect. So much so that he would have much preferred to save that particular apology for last, after he hopefully got Fang to be on friendly terms with him at the very least. Yet, with Naser now in the picture and the weight of his baggage, saving that particular apology for later had gone from something that he could put off for later to needing to be done ASAP.\n\n   \u2018Fuck,\u2019 Anon thinks as it slowly dawns on him that there\u2019s no getting around what\u2019s to come. \u2018I don\u2019t think I can do this alone, though\u2026\u2019\n\n   At precisely the moment Anon thought that, the door to the room swung wide, almost as if kicked open. Less than a second later, in pops a lime-yellow stegosaur with a big wide grin on her lips and cheerful glow that bordered on the ludicrous. \n\n   \u201cHoi, Anon! I\u2019m back!\u201d Stella shouts with all the subtlety of an atom bomb. The stego is no longer sporting her previous Natsuki-inspired tracksuit, but rather is back to wearing an outfit that seems to be a direct callback to her high school outfit: black jean shorts slightly longer than her old pair, a white shirt more on the slim-fitting side\u2014which help accentuate the curves and muscles that she\u2019d put on thanks to her cardio workouts over the last few years\u2014and a pair of black and white retro sneakers that probably belonged more in the late 80s or early 90s than the present day, all wrapped under her now trademark twin-bunned lime green hairstyle.\n\n   Both Anon and Naser turn to look at Stella with varying expressions. Naser, for his part, welcomes the sudden shift in the room\u2019s mood, thankful that Stella\u2019s sudden appearance brought about some form of levity to the serious conversation he\u2019d finished having with Anon. \n\n   Anon, on the other hand, can only close his eyes and put a hand over the ridge of his nose. \u2018Stella doesn\u2019t have an off switch, does she?\u2019 he asks himself.\n\n   \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think she does,\u201d Naser answers with a warm smile forming on his lips. \n\n   Anon turns to Naser and gives him a quizzical expression.\n\n   \u201cYou still mumble,\u201d Naser replies matter-of-factly to Anon\u2019s non-verbal question.   \n\n   \u201cOf course I do,\u201d Anon tells himself as he shakes his head in frustration.\n\n   \u201cOf course you what?\u201d Stella asks, stepping into the room and closing the door behind her. \u201cDid I interrupt a live-changing dialogue between you two or something? I-I can wait outside.\u201d\n\n   \u201cYou\u2019re already here,\u201d Naser answers as he takes a step away from Anon, all the while doing his best to bury the previous grief he had brought to bear. \u201cMe and Anon\u2026 we were just talking about\u2026 stuff...\u201d Naser takes a deep breath to steady himself before stuffing a hand into his pants pocket, all the while smiling in feigned confidence. \u201cYou know, catching up and whatnot.\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s eyes grow to the size of tea plates. \u201cOh!\u201d she announces as her expression brightens considerably. \u201cThat\u2019s SO good to hear then!\u201d\n\n   \u201cS-Stella,\u201d Anon starts, his full attention finally turning towards the genki dino, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n   Stella raises an eyebrow at the question. \u201cWhat am I doing? I\u2019m here to see you, of course!\u201d\n\n   \u201cI get that much\u2026 but WHY?\u201d Anon asks again, taking a step forward to emphasize his words.\n\n   Stella puts her hands behind her back, the posture once more making her look like she couldn\u2019t be more than a year out of high school. \u201cDo I really need an excuse to check up on someone dear to me?\u201d She asks the human.\n\n   Anon\u2019s only answer is to cross his arms and raise an eyebrow.\n\n   Stella rolls her eyes, puffs her lips, and crosses her arms. \u201cOh fine!\u201d she snaps, turning her gaze towards Naser, her brow furrowing in the process. \u201cI also came here because I heard Naser shouting and was afraid he was trying to strangle you again.\u201d\n\n   Naser rubs the back of his head and gives the anime-loving stego a sheepish grin. \u201cYeah\u2026 that was not my best moment in life\u2026\u201d\n\n   Stella replies to Naser\u2019s words by walking next to Anon and grabbing him by the arm while glaring at the young doctor.\n\n   Naser again sighs and looks away from the two. \u201cI\u2019d really appreciate it if\u2026 if you two would keep the whole... strangulation... situation to yourselves\u2026\u201d\n\n   \u201cOnly if you promise never to do it again!\u201d Stella snaps, her grip on Anon\u2019s arm growing tighter.\n\n   \u201cI-I swear it!\u201d Naser answers with a mixture of fear and shame.\n\n   Stella turns her eyes upwards as she ponders on what to say or do next. \n\n   In the meantime, Anon slips his arm out from Stella\u2019s grip and clears his throat. \u201cAt any rate,\u201d he starts, once more turning to face the ptero. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u2026 about your folks.\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s expression again sours as he\u2019s reminded of his problem. He leans against the nearest wall and ponders on what to do next. So long as he still had the regret of his parents, it would prevent him from facing Lucy. Yet meeting his parents wasn\u2019t a pleasant prospect for him at all. \u2018Especially after I\u2026\u2019\n\n   Naser winces as the memories lash at his being. \u2018No. I can\u2019t face them. Not after I said all those things to them\u2026\u2019\n\n   Stella\u2019s the one to clear her throat this time, causing Anon and Naser to turn their attention to her. As they do, she paces towards the middle of the room to stand facing the two males.\n\n   \u201cThe two of you are at a critical crossroads in your lives,\u201d Stella starts in a voice that Anon recognized as her \u2018mystic\u2019 mode. \u201cAnon,\u201d she says, turning to face the human. \u201cYou know what your destination is, but you don\u2019t know where to begin this journey or if you\u2019ll have the courage to see it through to the end.\u201d The stego turns to face the young doctor. \u201cAnd Naser, you fear the journey\u2019s start because of something you said or did in the past that\u2019s shackling you with fear.\u201d Stella closes her eyes and brings her hands together in what almost looks like a praying motion. \u201cFor the two of you to really heal, you have to take an initial step forward, and that step lies with an apology.\u201d\n\n   Anon and Naser look at each other in confusion. \u201cBut we already buried our respective hatchets,\u201d Naser says matter-of-factly.\n\n   Stella snapped open an eye and looked at Anon and Naser with mild annoyance. \u201cNot an apology to each other, dummies. An apology to the Aarans.\u201d She gives a nod and again crosses her arms behind her back as she opened her eyes and alternated her gaze between human and ptero. \u201cIt\u2019s been four years since the catastrophe with Fang, and since then, they have no doubt been suffering, not just because of their missing daughter, but also because of their wayward son.\u201d She fixes Naser with a serious gaze. \u201cJust like Anon, you left suddenly and without a word. You knew your destination, but you gave no one a roadmap of what roads you would use to get there. Because of that, you might as well have become a ghost. If what I heard is true, you haven\u2019t even kept in contact with your parents in years..\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s head dropped as he looked to the floor.\n\n   \u201cAnd Anon,\u201d Stella says next, her full attention turning to the human. \u201cWhile your journey to Fang is more direct, you\u2019re going to have to eventually confront the Aaran\u2019s about your part in their daughter\u2019s disappearance. Thankfully, you have both the conviction and knowledge now to face them with a head held high!\u201d\n\n   Stella gives the pair a warm smile as she reaches into her pocket and pulls out her trusty tarot deck. \u201cRight now, you are a literal hope bringer, Anon. The Aarans think their daughter is dead, but you know the truth, one they deserve to know.\u201d She shuffles her deck expertly, just like she did earlier with Anon, and draws the top card. She holds it facing towards her as her gaze again shifts between Anon and Naser.\n\n   Anon, swallowing a lump that had formed in his throat, looks Stella in the eye. \u201cWhat card is it?\u201d he asks, baffled that he was going along with something he considered to be trashy superstition days earlier.\n\n   Stella puts on a wide simper as she flips the card around, revealing it to Naser and Anon. \u201cUpright chariot!\u201d she cheers as she walks up to Naser and offers him the card.\n\n   Naser, with a shaky hand, takes the card and inspects the art. It depicts what looks to be a T-rex dino with a crown and regal armor atop an opulently ornate chariot. At the head of the chariot, two regal sphinxes, one white and one black, pull the chariot forward, their faces a mixture of human and dino features.\n\n   \u201cThe chariot card signifies that you have some hard work ahead of you,\u201d Stella says, causing Anon and Naser to pay close attention to her. \u201cIt may be resolved quickly, but the labor you are undertaking will probably tend towards the long and difficult. You will quite possibly experience rough roads, long uphill slopes, dead ends, and painful setbacks. This hard road will instill in you a strength of purpose, the ability to succeed through organization and endurance, and confidence possessed only by those who have done what they thought they could not. Harnessed correctly, few forces can stand against individuals like that\u2026\u201d\n\n   Naser once more looks down at the card in his hand. Not once has he ever believed in such occult practices as tarot cards or psychic readings. As a doctor, he believes in the rational and the physical. There is no room in medicine for the supernatural. Yet, something about Stella\u2019s reading filled him with intrigue and purpose. Even if Stella\u2019s reading was nothing but a bunch of smoke and mirrors bull, her words about finding absolution with his parents remained true. Facing his own past mistake and correcting it was the first step towards bettering himself. \n\n   Otherwise, he would wind up living the rest of his life unable to move on... \n\n   While Naser continued to stare at the chariot card with wide eyes, Stella walked right next to Anon again and gave him a toothy smile. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to worry about anything,\u201d she said, all the while jabbing his arm with her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m going to be keeping you company throughout this journey.\u201d\n\n   Anon blinked about five times before realizing what Stella meant by her words. A bead of sweat formed at the idea of having someone tag along with him, especially if that someone had admitted to having liked him in high school a day prior.\n\n   \u201cUh\u2026 isn\u2019t Rosa going to be pissed that you\u2019re not showing up to work?\u201d Anon asks earnestly.\n\n   \u201cOf course, she\u2019d be mad! But she\u2019s also the one who gave me the mission to look out after you. Just in case you decided to beat yourself up again!\u201d she flashes the human a peace sign and gives him a wink.\n\n   Anon rolls his eyes at Stella\u2019s words. \u2018Course, leave it to Rosa to still care about others, even when they weren\u2019t the best of friends towards her in the first place\u2026\u2019 \n\n   \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t all Rosa\u2019s idea, you know,\u201d Stella suddenly replies, her cheeks growing flushed at her words.\n\n   \u2018Damn. Mumbling,\u201d Anon thinks to himself before the total weight of Stella\u2019s words hits him. \n\n   \u201cWait, wait, wait!\u201d Anon snaps, taking a step away from Stella. \u201cYou WILLINGLY offered yourself to be my tail during this whole fiasco?\u201d\n\n   Stella gives Anon a sympathetic ear-to-ear smile. \u201cCourse! You really think I\u2019m going to miss out on an IRL redemption story to rival the Zuko arc?\u201d\n\n   Anon put on a smile as he shook his head and shrugged. Not like it changed anything about his goals. Plus, it would be nice to have the company of a person that never actively hated him to begin with. Especially now that he was going to be walking right into the den of a very angry, very violent pterodactyl... \n\n   Having come to terms with the fact that he had a permanent party member, Anon turned to Naser next. He walked up to the young doctor and put a hand on his shoulder in a show of camaraderie.\n\n   Naser looked up from the card and onto Anon\u2019s eyes with fear at first. Still, slowly, that fear dissolved as newfound determination began to take its place. The young doctor would be lying if he said that his stomach wasn\u2019t filled with ice at the prospect of facing his parents again, but he wouldn\u2019t be doing it alone. Anon was with him, and together the two could face the storm that was approaching.\n\n   Every journey started with a step. This was the first step. The most critical step... \n\n \n\n   It\u2019s several hours later. The sun had long set, and night had brought with it a frigidity uncharacteristic of that time of year in Volcaldera. Naser, Anon, and Stella stand outside of the Aaron residence, a very different expression on each of their faces: Fear, determination, and enthusiasm, respectively. \n\n   As the pale moonlight shines upon the household Naser and Fang once called home, and there is a certain level of anxiety within the human and pterodactyl\u2019s hearts. The last time the two were at the Aaran residence, their respective outlooks on life were brighter. Now the surrounding darkness felt like an apt reflection of what had become of their individual lives. Only the moonlight served as a beacon for what they needed to accomplish next.\n\n   Anon breathed heavily, his body quaking with warranted regret as he remembered his last visit to the Aaran residence. He remembers the faces of Fang\u2019s parents. He remembers the hopeful and sunny disposition of Mrs. Samantha, her joy of knowing her daughter was going to prom almost overwhelming. He remembers Mr. Ripley\u2019s scrutiny over Anon, and his parting words of warning before the human excused himself to \u2018feed\u2019 Metal Gear RAYmba, a lie that he still couldn\u2019t believe had worked. How right Mr. Ripley had been to distrust Anon with his daughter. Even following the old parental stereotype, Anon had proven the ptero patriarch\u2019s worst fears correct.\n\n   Naser, meanwhile, took just as heavy a breath as Anon as he too began remembering the past. His memories were initially good. He remembered getting along well with his parents. He remembered all the good times he had playing with Lucy when they were young. He remembered those carefree days before the accident. Then, his memories sour as he recalls the accident that left his wing crippled. He recalls the dour mood as he felt Lucy\u2019s anguish over her role in the event. How it started her down a dark path of insecurity and self-loathing. How it shaped her life from that moment on, leading to a spiraling of worsening problems as Lucy became Fang, Fang became non-binary, and Fang stopped thinking for herself, instead clinging on to anything and everything Trish told her to do, shaping his sister into something that by the end he could barely recognize as the once cheerful and energetic pirate princess he had grown up around. From there, the memories became bittersweet. He remembers vowing to make up for his sister's faults, excelling not because he wanted to, but rather because he needed to keep his parent\u2019s wrath away from his sister. He remembers meeting Naomi and thinking that she was the one. He reflects on his high school career, joining the track team and rising to become its captain, and his eventual rise to honor student. And, of course, he remembers prom night. How he had expected to see Anon and Lucy there, only to find out later that they never attended. That they instead had their own private prom, after which everything fell apart\u2026\n\n   Naser glanced sideways towards Anon, his brow furrowing and his hands curling into fists. A part of him rightfully wanted to strangle the human again for it as the fire of righteous indignation ignited in his soul once more. But as the young doctor inspected the eyes of his human companion, he too could see the pain that a past full of torment was assaulting him. He sighed, unfurled his fists, and let go of his anger for what felt like the millionth time that day. Anon may have been the cause of four years of pain for him, but he was also the catalyst for his now experiencing change.\n\n   As the anger faded, another memory came to Naser, one he had tried long and hard to suppress. He had no defenses against its overwhelming assault against his heart. How could he fight against it when every fiber of his being told him he shouldn\u2019t?\n\n   Naser takes a step back from his old home, all the while shaking his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispers as he completely turns away from the Aaran residence. \u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t do this\u2026\u201d\n\n   Both Anon and Stella turn to look at their ptero companion with concern. Being the only person whose heart wasn\u2019t burdened by painful memories, Stella walks back and grabs Naser by the arm. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d the stego asks, light-blue eyes scanning the young doctor\u2019s visage for any possible clue. \n\n   Naser shifts his eyes to meet Stella\u2019s gaze. For one moment, he stares deep into those light-blue pools in the hopes of finding some relief from the thorns gripping his heart. After about five seconds, he shuts his eyes tight and janks his arm away from Stella\u2019s grip before slowly shuffling towards the sidewalk\u2019s nearest curb. At this point, he sits down and buries his head in his hands.\n\n   \u201cN-Naser\u2026 you\u2026 you okay?\u201d Anon asks, unsure as to whether or not he should approach his troubled companion.\n\n   Naser slams a fist on the hard concrete and lets out a groan of pain. \u201cNo,\u201d he hisses through clenched teeth. \u201cI\u2026 I thought I could forge through the memories, but I just fucking can\u2019t!\u201d\n\n   \u201cThey can\u2019t be that bad,\u201d Stella says in her best attempt at cheering the ptero.\n\n   \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Naser snaps as he looks up at the moon. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m so fucking afraid of going back home\u2026\u201d He inhales unevenly as he shuts his eyes. \u201c...I said some really fucked up things\u2026 before I left\u2026\u201d\n\n   Naser allows the memories he had so desperately tried to suppress overcome his being, sending him back to what was perhaps the worst single night of his life\u2026\n\n \n\n   -Four Years Earlier-\n\n   Almost a month has passed since Lucy ran away from home. Dad turned all of Volcaldera upside down in search of her\u2014them\u2014I honestly don\u2019t even fucking know anymore. All I know is that ever since Lucy up and left, everything's gone to shit. \n\n   Graduation is only days away, yet I can\u2019t feel any joy about it. How can I when my sister\u2019s fucking gone missing? Even worse, dad won\u2019t shut up about how this is all my fault. Doesn\u2019t he know that I did everything that I could to keep Lucy on the straight and narrow? It\u2019s not my fault that she went and got herself indoctrinated into that enby bullshit by Trish. Not my fault she ended dating some deadbeat asshole that broke her heart... It\u2019s not my\u2026\n\n   Fuck. Fuck you, Anon. Seriously. FUCK. YOU. You were my friend. You were Lucy\u2019s friend. I thought you could be the one to pull her out of her rut finally. To give her the support she deserved and that I obviously couldn\u2019t provide. I fucking TRUSTED you! Instead, you turned out to be another asshole in a very long line of assholes I seem to be surrounded by...  \n\n   Fuck... even Naomi, the girl I thought would stick by me for the rest of my days, dumped my sorry ass. She didn\u2019t even give me a good reason. She only said that I had changed and that our relationship wasn\u2019t going to work out anymore. That I wasn't good enough for her either and that we were better off seeing others more like each other...\n\n   Well, of course I fucking changed! My sister\u2019s fucking gone missing! Did she expect me to laugh it off like it's nothing? Like this is another one of Lucy\u2019s personality reinventions? Fuck, for all I know, Lucy's probably dead by now. I mean, no one vanishes for close to a month without leaving some trace behind. I mean, for fuck\u2019s sake, dad\u2019s the police commissioner! He moved earth and sky and brought in every possible resource to search for Lucy, and even then, he found no trace of her anywhere! And who does he blame? Me, of course. Only Naser, the perfect son of the Aaran family... \n\n   Well, I\u2019m done getting blamed. I\u2019m done with everyone looking at me like I could have prevented this bullshit. I\u2019m done with Trish yelling at me like I was supposed to know that Anon was bad news. I\u2019m done having to endure Reed\u2019s look of distant disappointment every time our eyes meet. I\u2019m done taking my mother\u2019s silent judgment over my inability to keep my sister from vanishing. I\u2019m done bearing principal spear\u2019s stoic gaze of dissatisfaction.\n\n   I Am. Fucking. Done!\n\n   I slam shut my suitcase with as much force as I can before picking it up. I give my room one last look before turning around and storming out of the door. If I stay there another second, I will wuss out and not go through with it. I honestly can\u2019t think of a more horrible way to torture myself. A part of me wants me to reconsider what I\u2019m doing. I know it\u2019s stupid and reckless and petty, but I\u2019m all out of fucks to give. I head down the stairs as quickly as my legs can carry me. The sooner I get out of this house, the sooner I can move on from all the bullshit.\n\n   \u201cWhere are you going, Naser?\u201d my father\u2019s voice stops me in my tracks. I sigh and turn around. My dad is sitting there on the living room couch, a half-empty glass of something that smells like paint thinner in his hands.\n\n   I glare into my father\u2019s eyes but don\u2019t give him an answer. He should already know by the suitcase in my hand what the fuck I\u2019m doing.\n\n   My father downs the last of his drink and stands up from his seat, walking up to me and using his considerable bulk to try and intimidate me. \u201cAnd just what the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d He asks me like I\u2019m some kind of child.\n\n   \u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d I answer in the most resentful tone that I can muster.\n\n   Dad looks me up and down, almost like he\u2019s sizing me up like I\u2019m some kind of criminal. Who knows, by how he\u2019s been treating me for the last month, I might as well be a criminal in his eyes.\n\n   At that moment, my mother walks into the living room. She takes one look at the suitcase in my hand, and she rushes towards me, grabbing my arm like that\u2019s somehow going to prevent me from storming out the door.\n\n   \u201cW-why?\u201d She sobs out as tears flow from her seemingly permanently squinting eyes. \u201cWhy a-are you leaving us too?\u201d She tugs on my arm as if that\u2019s somehow going to change the mind I made up hours ago.\n\n   I can\u2019t take it anymore. I forcefully snatch my arm away from my mother and fix her with a furious glare. \u201cI\u2019m leaving because I\u2019m tired of being perfect!\u201d I shout, causing my mom to take a step away from me in fear. \u201cI\u2019m tired that no matter how hard I worked or how much I sacrificed, it never once felt like I was doing anything for myself, but instead to please everyone around me!\u201d I snap my eyes towards dad, who I can tell is getting real close to bringing out the golf clubs. Frankly, I don\u2019t give a fuck anymore. \u201cI\u2019m tired of always having to live with the knowledge that I had to excel to keep you from giving Lucy shit over an accident that happened years ago!\u201d I point an accusatory finger at my father, then turn back to look at my mother. \u201cAnd I\u2019m tired of having to be oh so perfect for a girlfriend who up and left me the instant I stopped being the absolute best!\u201d I balled my hand into a fist and grit my teeth so hard I could almost feel the enamel getting worn off. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being what everyone wants me to be\u2026 and I\u2019m not going to take it anymore!\u201d\n\n   Father rushes me with a speed I had never seen before in my life. Before I can fully process his movements, he grabs me by the collar of my shirt and slouches forward so that we\u2019re almost eye to eye.\n\n   \u201cYou\u2019re a real selfish brat right now, Naser,\u201d Dad tells me in a tone that\u2019s dripping with venom. \u201cI suggest you stop with the melodrama and get your head out of your ass before you hurt yourself.\u201d \n\n   I slap my father\u2019s hand away before shoving him away, albeit partially unsuccessfully due to his sheer bulk. Still, he gets the point as he looks at me with a shocked yet absolutely pissed expression.\n\n   \u201cI\u2019m not the one that needs to stop being selfish, dad,\u201d I say with as much vitriol as I can pack into my voice.\n\n   \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean,\u201d my father hisses through clenched teeth.\n\n   \u201cNot once did I ever see or hear you support Lucy\u2019s life choices. You only acted like she was some object that needed supervising. You never really understood her plight, the guilt she carried on her conscience. If you just tried to understand her for what she wanted to be and not what YOU wanted her to be, she wouldn\u2019t have felt the need to run away and possibly get killed!\u201d\n\n   \u201cAnd you think you\u2019re acting any better than your shithead of a sister!\u201d Father roared at me. \u201cYou\u2019re making the same fucking mistake!\u201d\n\n   And there it was. The real feelings dad had towards Lucy. Hearing him call her a \u2018shithead\u2019 almost felt cathartic. It verified all my emotions leading up to this moment. In a way, I almost wanted to thank him. He\u2019d made my decision all the easier for me to take.\n\n   I let out a bitter chuckle and turned away from my father. \u201cThen maybe Fang had the right idea,\u201d I say without so much as caring about what my words did to my father. Or my mother, for that matter. Though in the case of my mother, I did feel a little bit bad. I know she tried her best with us, but in the end, she didn\u2019t do anything to stop Lucy\u2014or rather, Fang\u2014from going down the path she wound up traveling. She shared as much guilt as my father did...\n\n   With those thoughts in my head, I make my way to the door, head held high and determined not to look back no matter what either my mother or father says to me. \n\n   As I grip my hand on the door handle, I hear my father roar, which gives me enough pause to hesitate.\n\n   \u201cNaser! If you walk out that door, then you better never come back to this house. You hear me!\u201d\n\n   I don\u2019t say another word as I turn the door handle and swing the door open. I don\u2019t stop as I shut the door behind me, and I walk down the walkway leading to my house. I do pause for a second to look back at the home I\u2019d probably never again return to. As I do, I hear the sound of shattering glass, followed by the wails of my mother as she no doubt falls on her knees weeping at the loss of her son.\n\n   I only turn right back around and finish making my way towards the Nas-Car. I stuff my suitcase in the trunk and make my way to the driver's seat. A slight sense of bliss fills me as I realize that I\u2019m doing something that won\u2019t help me achieve some kind of perfection for the first time in my life. Of course, that bliss is quickly overtaken by fear of the unknown future. Where would I go now? What will I do? \n\n   Whatever it is, it\u2019s going to be my choice. No one else\u2019s...\n\n \n\n   -Present Day-\n\nNaser let out a groan as he finished telling Anon and Stella something he had kept secret for close to four years. \n\n   Soon as his words are done, he again buries his face in his hands and sighs. \u201cI was so determined to escape from all the responsibilities and pressures of my life\u2026 except that I wound up doing exactly what I would have done anyway had I not had that outburst.\u201d The pterosaur began to laugh bitterly. \u201cI went to medical school like I was going to anyway and became a doctor as I would have anyway. My whole little rebellion accomplished nothing except getting me disowned and turning my family against me!\u201d He let out a single sniff and brought up his head, looking Anon directly in the eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so afraid of speaking to my parents again. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so afraid of meeting Lucy again\u2026\u201d\n\n   Anon, who had been quietly listening up to that point, looks to the floor in stunned silence. In his mind, Naser\u2019s hesitation sprung from his own perceived failures, that he was greatly exaggerating his guilt and working himself up over nothing. But after hearing the real reason for his old friend\u2019s hesitation to come home, he could completely understand the trepidation. \n\n   In some ways, his mistake was almost the same one he made with Fang four years earlier\u2026\n\n   \u2018This\u2026 complicates things,\u2019 Anon thought as he wondered what to do next.\n\n   \u201cComplicates things? Yes. Stops him from reaching his goal, no!\u201d Stella suddenly snapped as she grabbed Naser by the arm and forced him back to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re already here!\u201d she points to the house behind her, all the while looking deep into Naser\u2019s eyes. \u201cJust\u2026 take the plunge and make amends! I\u2019m sure your parents will understand and forgive you!\u201d\n\n   \u201cGod damned mumbling,\u201d Anon whispered as he looked at the scene playing before him. While he understands the exact train of thought that Stella had in mind, he still can\u2019t help but feel like it\u2019s not going to be satisfied in any way. Naser\u2019s mistake isn\u2019t something he can sweep under the rug with his parents. He cut ties with them, and they, in turn, probably cut ties with him. His actions and words led to his familial exile, something that is not so easily reversed. Something told him that Mr. Ripley was the kind of person to hold a very long, very spiteful memory of something like that\u2026\n\n   Naser glares at Stella and snatches his arm back. \u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say!\u201d he shouts, his cheeks turning a shade of red from anger, embarrassment, or both. \u201cYou weren\u2019t there to see their faces that night! How they looked at me like I was committing high treason!\u201d He shuts his eyes and turns away from the lime-yellow stego. \u201cThis\u2026 this was a stupid idea,\u201d he mutters, hanging his head in defeat. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026 wait in the Nas-Car,\u201d he whispers as the ptero staggers back to his car.\n\n   Stella turns back to face Anon, her eyes full of sadness and defeat. She looks to be on the verge of tears.\n\n   Anon feels an Anger bubble in him. In his mind, he wants to march up to Naser, slap some sense into him, and drag him back to his house\u2026 but he knows that he\u2019s projecting what he wants now. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that he, too, was precisely where Naser is now, a man afraid of his past, too broken and numb to even consider fixing his situation despite absolution lying literal feet away. A man so shackled by his fears that he was willing to turn away when all he had to do was reach out and grab that which tormented him so\u2026\n\n   \u2018No,\u2019 Anon whispered. He exhaled deeply and turned to face the Aaran residence. He still needed to apologize for what he did that night at the beach. Even if nothing got fixed that night, Fang\u2019s parents at least deserved to know that their daughter still lived. He was the reason she left them\u2026 making amends was the right thing to do, even if it was painful and potentially even dangerous\u2026\n\n   \u201cA-Anon?\u201d Stella called out the instant she noticed the new fire burning in her friend\u2019s eyes.\n\n   Anon, for his part, gave her a nod and smile before storming up to the Aaran household\u2019s door, at which point he rang the doorbell without a moment\u2019s hesitation.\n\n   Stella\u2019s eyes broadened in awe and horror. \u2018Oh my Jebus! That b-baka actually did it!?\u2019 she thinks, her mind reacting far faster than her body can to the audacity and craziness of Anon\u2019s act.\n\n   It takes less than ten seconds for the sound of heavy footsteps to approach the door. Anon wills his body to stand its ground despite every single one of his brain cells telling him to run away. He knows what he\u2019s exposing himself to. He knows what will happen the instant Mr. Ripley lays eyes on him, but he can\u2019t back out now. If his apology is the last thing he does in his life, it will at least be his best way to go out. \n\n   A just reward for a life full of bad decisions\u2026\n\n   \u201cHow many times do we have to tell you, bastards, we\u2019re not interested in anything you\u2019re sell\u2014\u201d Mr. Ripley roars out the moment he opens the door. The instant he locks eyes with Anon, his eyes fill with the kind of hate only a father who\u2019s forced to look upon the face of his child\u2019s killer can have. His whole body trembles as he clutches his hands shut so tightly that they pierce the palm and draw blood.\n\n   \u201cWhat is it, honey? Mrs. Samantha asks as she finds her way next to her husband, only also to be struck numb by the sight of Anon standing before her. Unlike her husband, though, the petite matriarch's expression is far more challenging to read. There is anger present, yes, but there is also sorrow, almost as if seeing Anon before her was akin to seeing the ghost of a past she had tried so desperately to move away from...\n\n   \u201cA-Anon?\u201d Samantha asks in a quiet, broken voice. Before another word leaves her lips, Anon finds a gigantic bloodstained hand wrapped around his neck, easily lifting him off the ground and holding him at least three feet above the ground. \n\n   Instinctively, Anon tries to grasp the gigantic dino hand constricting his breathing. As his hands fruitlessly try to lessen the terrible grip slowly squeezing the life out of him, he locks eyes with Mr. Ripley\u2019s amber orbs. They are awful, wrathful burning spheres that hold within them such overwhelming anger that Anon finds it amazing the elder ptero hasn\u2019t snapped his neck like he so very easily could.\n\n   \u201cHow fucking dare you show your face in house!\u201d Mr. Ripley roared as he lessened his grip just enough to allow Anon a breath of precious air before again constricting his neck. \u201cHOW DARE YOU COME BACK AFTER YOU TOOK MY DAUGHTER AWAY!\u201d\n\n   Mr. Ripley tightens his grip. Unlike Naser\u2019s chokehold, the human has no hope of reversing the elder ptero\u2019s terrible grip. Anon can only let out a strained gurgle as he feels his hand go numb. It suddenly dawns on him that he's on the verge of dying. That only makes his past regrets seem all the more terrible. With the last of his strength, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a piece of paper. In it, he wrote the exact address of where he had last seen Fang. He had scribbled it down, knowing full well that he might not live to see the following day.\n\n   So long as that information was known, he could at least die with some peace in his mind...\n\n   Samantha rushes forward and grabs her husband\u2019s arm. \u201cSTOP!\u201d she shouts as she desperately grips onto the matriarch\u2019s burly arm. \u201cYou\u2019re killing him!\u201d\n\n   \u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d Ripley answers coldly and distantly. He was done being nice. He was done being idle. For four years, he had let the pain fester in his heart. Now that he had the one responsible in his grasp, he would not waste his opportunity to achieve some form of absolution. Even if it meant damming his soul to hell...\n\n   Stella looks around her in a panic. She knows well she has no chance of stopping someone as big and robust as Mr. Ripley, but she's not going to stand by as she watches the life of someone precious to her get snuffed out. \u2018Even if I made no difference. Even if I get hurt in the process, I\u2019m not letting Anon die!\u2019 She thinks as she musters all of her strength and wills her legs to move.\n\n   But before she can spring forth to action, a blur of brown and orange rush past her. Before her mind can finish processing what her eyes had seen, she hears the voice of Naser, letting out a roar of fury. The stego turns her attention to the scene in time to see the young doctor attempt to tackle his father. \n\n   While Naser\u2019s form isn\u2019t nearly large enough to leave a dent on Ripley, the force of his sprint, combined with the element of surprise with which it occurred, causes the patriarch to lose his wind temporarily. More importantly, the blow is enough to force him to loosen his grip on Anon\u2019s neck, all the while pushing him further into the house's foyer.  \n\n   Anon Falls on the ground choking and gagging in a desperate attempt to bring oxygen back into his lungs. The previous strength Stella had been putting into rushing and tackling the elder ptero she puts towards hurrying to Anon's side. Wasting not a second, she picks up the human and helps him sit against a nearby wall, all the while checking his neck for any wound that would prevent him from adequately absorbing oxygen.\n\n   Meanwhile, Ripley lets out a roar of rage as he readies his fist to smash down on whoever dared interrupt his attempt at obtaining justice. Before he can make contact, the assailant jumps back and fixes him with a glare full of mixed emotions ranging from rage, regret, fear, and finally to\u2026 happiness? \n\n   Ripley manages enough breaths in his lung to cool some of his rage. In that moment of sudden clarity, he recognizes the face of the ptero now glaring back at him and standing guard over the body of the human he\u2019d been so joyously strangling seconds ago.\n\n   Ripley\u2019s expression flashes with mixed emotions at the sight of the son he thought he\u2019d never see again. Anger at his daring to show his face in his house again. Joy at seeing him again despite their previous fallout. Relief at seeing him not only alive but also healthy and strong. Finally, back to anger, not just as the fact that he had come back after what he did four years earlier, but that he was protecting the one who had caused all their pain and misery in the first place. He couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around that last part, and it filled him with such bitterness that it was starting to make him see red.\n\n   Ripley opens his mouth to shout at his son. He\u2019s cut off when Samantha rushes forward and wraps Naser in a tight embrace, her arms and wings forming a protective cocoon over her child as she allows herself to weep. \u201cMy son!\u201d she says through the sobs. \u201cM-my N-Naser\u2019s back home!\u201d Her grip over her son grows tighter as her tears begin to stain Naser\u2019s trademark arboreal jacket. \u201cI-is it really y-you!?\u201d\n\n   Naser, for his part, returns his mother\u2019s embrace. \u201cYes,\u201d he whispers, trying his best not to break into sobs of his own. \u201cIt\u2019s really me. I-I\u2019m back\u2026\u201d \n\n   Naser broke off from his mother\u2019s embrace and turned to meet his father as much as he hated to. He again fixes the elder ptero with a glare as he takes a step forward so that the two are standing within arm\u2019s reach of each other.\n\n   Ripley narrows his eyes and puffs out his chest in a display of intimidation. It doesn\u2019t work quite as he intended, as Naser only intensifies the glare in his eyes. As elder and junior ptero continue their stand-off, the very air grows heavy as the dinos seemingly prepare to enter into a no-holds-barred brawl.\n\n   \u201cSTOP IT!\u201d Samantha shouts at the top of her lungs, jumping between her son and husband, all the while putting her hands up and spreading her wings as wide as they can go. \u201cStop this nonsense, NOW!\u201d\n\n   Samantha, the usually laid back and relaxed housewife of the Aaran household, snaps her regularly closed eyes wide open and sets her visage into a deep and terrible scowl, one she brings down upon both her husband and child. Almost as soon as that terrible gaze falls upon them, the two pteros lose whatever swagger they were building and shrink back in fear.\n\n   \u201cNow, you two listen to me!\u201d Samantha starts, her voice cold and barely holding back the rage bubbling in her chest. \u201cI have been waiting for the day that our family returns to some semblance of togetherness for four years. FOUR YEARS!\u201d she snaps, all the while shifting her gaze back and forth between her warring son and husband. \u201cNow that our boy has returned home, we will try to be a HAPPY family!\u201d The petite ptero matriarch snaps her glare directly at Ripley. She takes a step forward, all the while jabbing a finger into the ptero patriarch\u2019s chest. \u201cAnd I will NOT have you ruin this with your stupid machismo!\u201d She then snaps her glare back to Naser, who can't help but take a step back out of fear. \u201cOr you with your rebelliousness!\u201d she hisses through clenched teeth. \u201cThe two of you are going to make up this instant, or so help me I\u2019m going to smack the two of you around until you do!\u201d\n\n   Ripley\u2019s brow fills with dozens of beads of sweat. He uncomfortably shifts his gaze around the foyer, looking at everything and anything that wasn\u2019t his son or wife. \n\n   Finally, after the piercing and hot glare of his wife breaks through the last of his rage-created defenses, Ripley clears his throat and takes a step towards Naser. With a heavy sigh, he softens his gaze and raises his hands. \u201cNaser\u2026 m-my boy\u2026 I\u2026 m-missed you,\u201d he says in a voice that almost comes off as bashful.\n\n   Despite his previous rage, Naser is surprised to hear his father sound so vulnerable. Vulnerability was already a concept he was convinced his father had never learned or actively ripped out of his brain, so to see it happen before his eyes left him with a feeling that he can barely describe. Gradually though, the feeling supplants whatever negativity he might have harbored towards his dad, to the point that the reason he had once feuded with him became less and less critical. With a final sigh to dispel any negative emotion from himself, Naser looks at his father\u2019s eyes, the corners of his lips rising ever so slightly in the process. \u201cI\u2026 I missed you too, dad\u2026\u201d  \n\n   Samantha claps her hands together and once more shuts her eyes as a smile returns to her lips. \u201cSee, was that so hard?\u201d she asks in a sweet yet vaguely threatening voice. She quickly rushes to the front door and shuts it, ensuring that whatever other shouting happened, it would stay inside the Aaran residence.\n\n   Both Naser and Ripley let out a nervous chuckle before sighing in relief.\n\n   Crisis averted for the time being.\n\n   Naser looks back to Anon. Despite the human\u2019s best efforts, he was still struggling to breathe, even with Stella helping him sit upright.\n\n   Wasting not one second, Naser rushes towards his friend and inspects his neck. He lets out a hiss as he realizes that while there was no external damage, the force of his father\u2019s grip very nearly crushed the windpipe. There would be definite bruising and soreness, maybe even another visit to the hospital if it were bad enough...\n\n   Naser looks at Stella. \u201cHelp me get him up,\u201d he tells the still shocked stego. She follows the order without question. \u201cHold him up and steady,\u201d he tells her as he lets go of Anon\u2019s arm and turns back to face his father, all the while his brow furrows and his eyes sharpen. \n\n   \u201cThat was way out of line, dad!\u201d\n\n   Ripley shoots Anon a glare before setting his sight back on Naser. \u201cWhy are you defending that piece of scum? You know well what he did to this family.\u201d\n\n   Naser hesitates for a second. The dying amber of his hate threatens to set his soul alight once again, but he snuffs them out by telling himself that he was past that point in his life. \u2018Besides\u2026\u2019 he thinks before taking a deep breath of air and steeling himself for his words to come. \u2018He\u2019s doing something I was too cowardly to do for so many years\u2026\u2019\n\n   \u201cDad\u2026 I know what Anon did. Believe me; I have lived with that knowledge for the last four years too.\u201d\n\n   Ripley crosses his arms. \u201cIf you know, then why ar\u2014\u201d\n\n   \u201cDESPITE that,\u201d Naser snaps, cutting his father\u2019s words off and causing the elder ptero\u2019s eyes to go broad with surprise. \u201cAnon\u2019s the reason I\u2019m here tonight. If it wasn\u2019t for his\u2026 lack of self-preservation\u2026 I would have kept on living without once thinking about making amends with you and mom...\u201d  \n\n   Naser\u2019s words shake Ripley to his core. He shoots another glare towards Anon, who, for his part in all of this, continues to stand there supported by a woman he was sure he\u2019d never seen before, holding on to his neck and still attempting to breathe. How could that human be both responsible for his daughter\u2019s vanishing and the return of his son?\n\n   \u201cDad,\u201d Naser says as he takes another step forward. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 that I also ran from this family four years ago. It was the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d He shut his eyes and sighs wearily. \u201cI was so convinced that running from all of this would lead me to a better life... when the reality was that it led me to repeat so many of the same mistakes. Worse yet, it turned me into something I wasn\u2019t!\u201d The young doctor takes another step forward and once again stops only an arm\u2019s length away from his father. \u201cI stopped socializing for fear of losing my friends and loved ones like I did with Lucy and Naomi. I tossed myself into my schoolwork and did nothing else in a desperate attempt to prove that I was still perfect when that perfection was what was killing me. I pushed my body and mind to the brink daily so that I could focus on getting that damn degree when that only caused me physical and emotional anguish... and for what? Only to return home an almost broken man desperate to one day find his sister and make the one responsible for her vanishing pay\u2026\u201d Naser puts his head on his father\u2019s chest and lets out a mournful sob. \u201cC-can you find it in your heart to forgive a stupid, idiot boy for all of his mistakes?!\u201d The ptero cries out, unable to keep his composure any longer. \n\n   To say that Ripley is stunned by his son\u2019s words is an understatement. Within the ptero patriarch, a fierce battle rages between his mind and his heart. His mind told him that he couldn\u2019t let go, that he couldn\u2019t forgive. One didn\u2019t just forget four years with a finger snap. His son had made a grave mistake, and he deserved to be punished as gravely for it. If he didn\u2019t, could he call himself a lawman at all?\n\n   Ripley\u2019s heart, however, sang a very different tune. It told him that punishment wouldn\u2019t magically turn back the hands of the clock. His child had returned to him and was within arm\u2019s reach, begging for forgiveness for a crime that wasn\u2019t even all his in the first place\u2026\n\n   It was that final recognition that stung the hardest for Ripley. In all his stubbornness, he first gave up on Lucy and put all of the world\u2019s weight on Naser\u2019s shoulders. When Lucy ran away, he blamed Naser for failing to be a good brother, neglecting to realize that it had been Naser and only Naser who had ever truly cared for Lucy. If there was anyone who had failed Lucy in her most significant time of need, it was neither Naser nor Anon as he had believed for so long. \n\n   The chain of failure had started with him\u2026\n\n   Tears welled in Ripley\u2019s eyes as he embraced his son for the first time in four years. \u201cSon,\u201d he starts, his voice barely holding together as it threatens to burst into sobbing. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry too. I should've never put so much pressure on your shoulders. I Shouldn\u2019t have ever given up on Lucy as I did. I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Ripley increases the tightness of his embrace on his son, who in return also embraces his father all the harder. \n\n   The hug between father and son lasts almost a full minute. By the time Naser breaks it, his eyes are puffy and red, though the smile on his lips speaks another story, one of joy and peace after so many years of regrets and sorrows. He turns to face his mother, an apology already formed in the tip of his tongue, when she merely rushes forward and hugs him again like there was no tomorrow.\n\n   \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026 my sweet little Naser. I f-forgive you!\u201d Samantha managed to say between sobs of joy. \n\n   Ripley moves forward and also hugs his son and wife, wrapping the two in a protective cocoon with both his arms and wings.\n\n   While by no means a complete family yet, in that fleeting moment, the Aaran\u2019s felt like in the old days, before the pressures of life and disappointments about the future battered and tore at their dreams.\n\n   For one moment, Naser, Ripley, and Samantha dared to believe they had found a small piece of peace once again\u2026 \n\n   Despite his best efforts to keep his presence as diminished as possible, Anon lets out a string of painful coughs, which nearly causes him to double over as the pain racks at his throat. The only thing that keeps him standing is Stella\u2019s diligent grip. \n\n   Ripley lets go of his family and walks up to both Anon and Stella. His previous expression of bliss vanishes the instant he locks eyes with the human. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t understand you... You\u2019re the reason that Lucy ran away... yet you\u2019re also the reason my son came back\u2026\u201d Ripley grimaces as he again moves to grab the dainty caveman. \n\n   Before Ripley\u2019s hand can get anywhere near Anon, Stella slaps it away, which causes the ptero to stop in his tracks and flinch in surprise. The stego then begins dragging the human away from Ripley and towards the house\u2019s main entrance.\n\n   Ripley turns to face his wife with a flabbergasted expression on his face. The diminutive ptero shakes her head in reply before pointing to her husband and making a strangling motion with her hands.\n\n   It takes about two seconds before Ripley\u2019s eyes widen as the realization hits him like one of his golf clubs to the head.\n\n   Meanwhile, Stella is making some headway dragging Anon, who for his part is doing his best to struggle against the stego\u2019s grasp. \u201cLet\u2026 go\u2026 of me,\u201d he hisses at his dino companion.\n\n   \u201cIt\u2019s okay Anon, I\u2019ll get you out of here!\u201d Stella boldly declares as she tries her best to lift the human over her shoulder. Of course, the moment she manages to get his feet off the ground, Anon\u2019s weight, combined with her awkward footing, causes the stego to collapse backward. She hits the ground pretty hard, leaving her partially addled. \n\n   Anon, meanwhile, is flung backward at least five feet. He winds up striking his head against a nearby wall, causing him to see more than a few stars.\n\n   Seconds later, Anon feels a strong hand lift him off the floor and stand him straight. It takes the human a few seconds for his vision to fully return, by which time he realizes far too late that the one who picked him off the floor had been none other than Ripley.\n\n   Swallowing very painfully, Anon looks up to meet Ripley\u2019s eyes. Instantly, he feels the very warmth leave his body. At the same time, he also feels a strange sense of ease. \u2018Sooner or later, I was gonna get killed,\u2019 he thinks as he mentally prepares for Naser\u2019s father to grab his neck once again, this time finishing what he had started minutes earlier.\n\n   But before Ripley could have his shot at strangling him, he needed to get the guilt off his chest.\n\n   \u201cI\u2026 I understand if you never forgive me\u2026\u201d Anon whispered in a strained, raspy voice. \u201cI know... I have... no right... to apologize for... what I did to your daughter... but\u2026\u201d Wasting not one single second, the young man bows his head before Ripley. \u201cI\u2019m truly\u2026. truly sorry... for my actions... that night...!\u201d \n\n   Ripley lets out a sneer as he drags Anon forward. He even slouches forward enough so that he\u2019s face to face with the human. \n\n   \u201cI\u2019ll never forgive you for helping to kill my daughter,\u201d Ripley hisses, his words colder than the coldest glacier on earth. \n\n   Anon takes the patriarch\u2019s words and shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong\u2026 about... Fa\u2014L-Lucy,\u201d Anon manages to say despite his ravaged voice doing everything it can to fail him.\n\n   Ripley\u2019s eyes snap wide, and he grits his teeth in absolute fury. \u201cWhat did you say, punk!?\u201d he growls, his face coming dangerously close to Anon\u2019s.\n\n   \u201cFang\u2019s... alive\u2026!\u201d Anon barely manages to rasp, his voice giving into a cacophony of coughs seconds after he managed to speak those crucial words to Ripley.\n\n   Upon hearing Anon\u2019s words, the ptero patriarch locks eyes with Anon and grabs him by the shoulder, albeit a bit more gently this time. \u201cW-what did you say?\u201d He asks the human in a flabbergasted tone. \n\n   \u201cFang\u2019s\u2026 alive\u2026\u201d Anon repeats, all the while trying to stop his heart from beating faster than an anime fan who somehow managed to score himself a date for prom night with the head cheerleader. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know... what she\u2019s been doing... for the last four years... but I saw her playing a shitty gig... a little over a week ago at a pizzeria in... Skin Row\u2026\u201d\n\n   \u201cO-one week ago!\u201d Ripley shouts in a mixture of pain and rage.\n\n   Anon flinches at the ptero\u2019s raised voice. He glances to the side and notices how Samantha and Naser are helping Stella back to her feet. She looks a little worse for wear but overall seemed to be unharmed. Anon let out a sigh of relief, though he wasn\u2019t sure why since Stella had caused him to fall earlier with her \u2018rescue\u2019 attempt. Still, he couldn\u2019t fault her for trying.\n\n   With that particular burden off his shoulders, and his newfound determination pushing him to say what needed to be said, Anon once more narrated his life up until he met with Naser. He told it all, from his return to Volcadera after four years in the navy, to his running across Fang by complete chance, to his regret for not speaking to her when he had a chance, to the subsequent week and its mocking dreams of a better life, to his drinking and smoking and self-harm and eventual hospitalization. \n\n   On hearing his friend end his tale, Naser leaves Stella\u2019s side and stands beside the human, also looking his father in the eye. With a deep sigh to steel his nerves, he picks up right where Anon left off. He, too, tells it all and tells it truly, including the moment when he tried to strangle Anon before his realization hit like a train full of bricks. \n\n   Anon takes a step forward and approaches Ripley with a determined look in his eyes. He\u2019s aware of the danger he\u2019s putting himself in by just being that close to the still furious elder ptero. Still, a part of him isn\u2019t afraid anymore. Much like with Naser before, he couldn't afford to run, not if he could fix all of the mistakes in his life.\n\n   \u201cMr. Ripley,\u201d Anon starts, his voice still raspy and weak but also filled with newfound courage. \u201cI may\u2026 have made many mistakes\u2026 in my life\u2026 but I\u2019m done\u2026 running and hiding\u2026 from them...\u201d He fixes the ptero with a grin. Weak at first, but growing with confidence with every passing second. \u201cI will\u2026 set things... right with Fang\u2026 and I will\u2026 bring her back home\u2026 even if it\u2019s\u2026 the last thing I do\u2026 because\u2026 this is my second\u2026 chance\u2026 and I am not\u2026 wasting it\u2026!\u201d\n\n   Ripley\u2019s face is a mixture of strong emotions. Anger, confusion, regret, despair, happiness, and perhaps strongest of all, hope. He can only look at the human with confoundment, his previous words about how he couldn\u2019t understand the human buzzing in his mind. A part of him wanted the simplicity that came with hating the human. Yet, from hearing his tale and feeling the regret in his voice and seeing the shame in his eyes, the elder ptero found any reason to despise Anon fading by the second. After all, how could he hate someone who had already suffered so much and had come out stronger for it? How could he hate someone so determined to right all his wrongs?\n\n   Ripley bitterly chuckles to himself. Much as the idea seemed alien to him in this world, perhaps in some other place and time, Anon would have made a good husband to Lucy...\n\n   Samantha walks up to Anon without saying a word. Anon, for his part, is startled by the sudden appearance of the petite ptero, but he tells himself that whatever she had to say to him, he more than deserved. He locks his eyes with the matriarch\u2019s closed eyes. Even so, he can still feel her gaze pierce right through him, exposing his every weakness to her perception as if she had x-ray vision.\n\n   The matriarch of the Aaron household breathes deep, and without a single moment of hesitation, slaps Anon across the face, causing the human to stagger sideways a bit, as the impact of the slap is both so sudden and so powerful. \u2018God, it feels like I just got punched by a martial arts champ!\u2019 Anon manages to cobble together in his brain as he instinctively rubs his cheek, which feels like it\u2019s swelling with every passing second.\n\n   \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 for breaking the heart of my little pirate princess\u2026\u201d Samantha says coldly. Anon readjusts his posture and nods, accepting the blow as well-earned. He readied himself for another when he sees Samantha\u2019s arms twitch. He closes his eyes and prepares himself for the pain that's to come.\n\n   But what came next wasn\u2019t something the human expected.\n\n   Samantha lets out a sob and lunges forward, wrapping her arms around Anon, locking him in a tight embrace that made his muscles ache from the surprising amount of force the petite housewife could generate.\n\n   Anon does not return the embrace. He does not feel like he deserves to...\n\n   \u201cThank you for bringing my son back to me,\u201d Samantha sobs into Anon's shoulder, which suddenly becomes sodden with tears as the ptero lets herself weep freely. Less than ten seconds later, Fang\u2019s mother breaks the embrace and makes her way next to her husband, who finally appears to be composed enough to speak again.\n\n   \u201cAnon I\u2026\u201d Ripley begins, his voice coarse and uneven, almost as if he was struggling to maintain his usual gravely demeanor. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Ripley shuts his eyes and lets out a loud groan before he again fixes Anon with a glare. Only, this glare isn\u2019t one of hatred or anger or resentment. Instead, it's filled with something Anon never thought he\u2019d see from Fang\u2019s father\u2026\n\n   \u201cDammit, kid, you\u2019ve given me the one thing I never thought I\u2019d have ever again\u2026\u201d He snarls and points a finger at the human. \u201cI swear in the name of Raptor Jesus, if you are fucking lying to us about our daughter, I\u2019m going to mount your head on my wall, damn be whatever jail time I have to face!\u201d\n\n   Anon again painfully swallows as he nods.\n\n   The elder ptero walks up to the human and grabs him by the shoulders. At first, Anon believes he\u2019s about to get strangled again, but that fear\u2019s put to rest when Ripley, much to the human\u2019s shock, brings him in for a hug of his own. \n\n   As if the embrace wasn\u2019t already surprising enough, he hears the ptero patriarch break down into silent, dignified sobs, all the while his grip on the human grows tighter and tighter.\n\n   \u201cThank you for giving this old man hope again,\u201d Ripley whispered through barely contained sobs. \u201cThank you\u2026\u201d\n\n   Anon brings up an uneasy hand and pats Ripley in the back. As he does, his determination grows ever more potent than before, supplanting whatever doubts he might have had in the past about his next course of action.\n\n   It was time to set things right with Fang...","encoded":false},"A Casual Meeting.txt":{"path":["Multiple","A Casual Meeting.txt"],"text":"Title: A Casual Meeting\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Spears and Ripley\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n3:10 AM, at a sleepy 24\/7 rest stop off of a major interstate. The air inside is frigid cold despite the lukewarm early dawn summer air outside, a welcome respite for the weary family of tourists that sat at one of the windowside tables as their children stared out into the night and chewed on their wholly inappropriate breakfast of dry cheesy pork sausage rolls that had been turning in the warmer since last evening. The television blasted out a rerun of a story on VNN as the smell of cheap coffee battled it out with the harsh, sterile scent of the blue chemical that thankfully mostly covered up the stench of the neglected bathrooms.\n\nPrincipal Spears yawned and stretched his neck, sighing in relief as he felt the aching of driving at such early hours ease up after a few quiet pops. He stared at the half-dead coffee machine that was slowly dripping its burnt caffeine goodness into the first of two cheap styrofoam cups. At least it provided him an excuse to relax a little before he would rejoin his sleeping wife in the car.\n\nA set of heavy, shambling footsteps pulled his attention away from his morning coffee.\n\n\u201cAh! Sheriff Ripley, good morning. I\u2019m surprised to see you all the way out here.\u201d\n\u201cMornin\u2019 Principal... Spears...\u201d\n\u201cHaving an early start? Or maybe a late night?\u201d\n\u201cLate night. The boys in the next precinct over were planning a massive midnight drug bust on a den right on the border and they requested our help. Sent over six squad cars and a chopper. Shoulda\u2019 sent the whole damn force in hindsight.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like quite the operation.\u201d\n\u201cIt was, Raptor Jesus, it was. Spent the entire night rounding up a bunch of dealers hopped up on their own goods through the woods. Ever seen a dino hopped up on Blue Sparkle or BigPig or whatever they\u2019re callin\u2019 it nowadays?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t say I have?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy stuff. I swear one of them turned into a skinnie from how he was swinging from the trees\u2026 Oh uh, sorry \u2018bout that Principal...\u201d\n\u201cNo worries. I\u2019m glad I never had to deal with that at Volcano High. The worst case I\u2019ve witnessed was a student accidentally bringing his marijuanna. Although I do suspect one of my students was on something a little stronger. Carfentanyl, perhaps. I never did catch them but from how the smell seems to have disappeared I suspect the student in question has graduated.\u201d\n\u201cHeh. Carf. I wish I was dealing with Carfers. If that\u2019s the worst at your place then you\u2019ve ran that school well.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Sheriff. Ah. It looks like it\u2019s full. I\u2019ve got another cup to fill for my wife, would you like to go first?\u201d\n\u201cNah\u2026 Nah, thanks but you go ahead, I might just stare at the doughnuts til you\u2019re done\u2026 I ain\u2019t got anywhere to go but home anyhow... From the getup I\u2019m guessin\u2019 you\u2019re on a little summer break road trip?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. My wife and I are visiting her family in Wyoming.\u201d\n\u201cWyoming, huh. Gonna catch an early flight?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately no. My wife is terrified of planes.\u201d\n\u201cOh hell, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re driving all the way over there!?\u201d\n\u201cWe are. We flew the last time we visited but she couldn\u2019t handle it. In any case it won\u2019t be just a drive. We do plan on visiting a few places in between. Mostly the usual tourist attractions but my wife swears that there is a restaurant that we absolutely have to stop at on the way.\u201d\n\u201cSounds fun. How\u2019s your wife, by the way?\u201d\n\u201cVery well, thank you for asking. She made sure we had her favorite Korean war drama for the trip. The Burning Flower of Incheon and the Enraged Dragon of Water, all fifty-two episodes.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, you into that sorta stuff?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately no. It\u2019s interesting enough to be entertaining, however my tastes lie slightly more to the east.\u201d\n\u201cYou bring any of your own stuff?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I can\u2019t be distracted while driving and my wife can\u2019t stand most of what I like anyways.\u201d\n\u201cMan\u2019s gotta make sacrifices for the wife, eh?\u201d\n\u201cAs all husbands must. There we are, I\u2019m sorry it took so long.\u201d\n\u201cEgh\u2026 Don\u2019t worry about it. This whole place is falling apart.\u201d\n\u201c...\u201d\n\u201c...damn, no hazelnut creamer.\u201d\n\u201cHazelnut? I mean no offence but I always assumed police officers liked their coffee straight black.\u201d\n\u201cMost don\u2019t but they still get it like that. Rookies, the lot of \u2018em. Think they gotta act macho in front of the boss. Nuts to that, I want my doughnut to be the healthy option.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I assume the doughnut will be similarly sugared?\u201d\n\u201cHaha! You got that right! Plain? Dunked in coffee? No thanks. Powdered sugar, sprinkles, filled with as much lemon creme without it burstin\u2019. I see enough rough garbage out there, no need to eat it too. Just don\u2019t tell my wife. She always gets on my case about how I need to watch my sugar intake.\u201d\n\u201cOverconsumption of sugar is unhealthy, that much is true.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know. But it\u2019s the sugar or I take my wife with me to work and I can\u2019t take my wife with me to work.\u201d\n\u201cHow sweet.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell her that either, she\u2019s never gonna forget it.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you should. It would sweeten the marriage a little bit.\u201d\n\u201cHa! Ya know, maybe I will. Our anniversary\u2019s coming up next week. \u2018My Dearest Samantha, Your Sugar To My Coffee.\u2019 Hah, that\u2019s a good one! I\u2019m getting that one on a ring!\u201d\n\u201cOn a ring?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s into that sort of corny, sappy romantic garbage. Hell, it might actually work.\u201d\n\u201cWell in any case, Congratulations on your marriage, Sheriff.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, buddy. You gettin\u2019 a doughnut too?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I will. We do have sandwiches in the car but I do want a hot breakfast...\u201d\n\u201cHot, eh? You gotta get the hashbrowns then. It\u2019s the one thing this place does great. I dunno if it\u2019s the oil they use or what but that kid back there knows what the hell he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\u201cWell now I\u2019m going to have to, if it\u2019s good enough for you to recommend it.\"\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re gonna want to get at least two per person.\u201d\n\u201cTwo?\u201d\n\u201cYep, one to eat hot and the second to eat after it\u2019s cooled off first. It\u2019s crazy but I swear it tastes even better cold.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sometimes I get a half-dozen if I know I\u2019m going to be out for a while. Ooh, \u2018nother thing to keep from my wife. Too much salt, she says.\u201d\n\u201cHusband\u2019s honor.\u201d\n\u201cFrom how you\u2019ve run that school I feel I can take that to the bank.\u201d\n\u201cThank you very much again, Sheriff. I\u2019m honored.\u201d\n\u201cHey now, both my kids have a good future. Any principal that makes that possible is good in my book! Tell ya what, your coffee and hash browns are on me today!\u201d\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s no need to go that far out of your way for me!\u201d\n\u201cNuts, let\u2019s just call it thanks for all you\u2019ve done! Need anything else?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ve got everything I wanted.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure? No snacks? No drinks or- Ooh, sorry.

The savory smell of the salt water, the whistling winds flowing by everyone's ears, the cawing of the seagulls, and the perfect air brought him a wonderful feeling of content that he unfortunately hasn't felt in a while. With everything in mind though, he wouldn't trade this for the world. He had the girl, he had the ones who would always watch his back, and he had the bright future ahead of him now.\n\nEveryone's decked out in their own special outfits, too. Trish is in an all-black swimsuit with an eye-catching lei flourishing with a heavy variety of colors, Reed's in a simple white tank top with black swim trunks and shades glowing with a vaporwave-esque color palette, Fang's in a one-of-a-kind VVURM DRAMA top with fire in the background along with a swimsuit of her own underneath. Anon's in a jacket like Naser's with grey and red swim trunks.\n\nReed takes another inhale with his boof, smiling as he does so before glancing to Anon.\n\n\u201cHey, man\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here with us.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve changed us, man.

Trish notices this, and she can barely contain her excitement by the look on her face. Her tail is wagging incredibly fast, too.\n\nDoes she ship this or something?\n\n\u201cGuys\u2026\u201d\n\nAnon and Reed let each other go with a happy sigh as Anon continues.\n\n\u201cThis has truly been a wonderful adventure. You\u2019ve all given my life meaning. Before you all came along\u2026 I had no idea where I was headed. Now, I have a great future of me and the best group of friends that any person could ask for.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade you all for the world.\u201d\n\nA moment of happy silence follows. Everyone is touched by Anon\u2019s words, and it shows.\n\n\u201cStupid skinnie\u2026\u201d\n\nA curious Anon looks at Trish, waiting for her response.\n\n\u201cUgh\u2026 I can\u2019t believe I used to hate you. I tried pushing you away, and\u2026 I wasn\u2019t seeing what I could have missed.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve grown on me, you idiot\u2026\u201d\n\nTrish wipes away a tear with a closed hand and sniffles. Anon starts to feel witty as he responds himself.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, trigga? Couldn\u2019t get enough of me?\u201d\n\nShe quickly jabs Anon in the gut, forcing a laugh out of everyone.\n\n\u201cOW!\u201d\n\u201cYou deserve that, prick.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I probably did.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, can\u2019t believe I used to call you that\u2026\u201d\n\nAnon turns his head to Fang, with a true smile on his face.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even be here if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d\n\u201cI love you, Fang.\u201d\n\nAnon makes his way to Fang and embraces her with his head on her shoulder. Fang lets out a small chuckle as she practically cradles Anon with her arms and enveloping him with her wings.\n\n\u201cLove you too, dork\u2026\u201d\n\nThe feeling of Fang\u2019s embrace combined with the texture of the wings surrounding Anon makes the world around him melt into nothing. It was almost as if he had prematurely entered heaven. It was at this moment that Anon knew that everything would be okay.\n\nAnother long silence follows as everyone takes in the world around them. Nothing could possibly ruin what they had right in front of them. Time seems to slow down as senses enhance and envelop the moment. After what felt like a welcome eternity, Anon and Fang let go of their embrace as he speaks up once more.\n\n\u201cWith whatever I may be doing in the future, I don\u2019t want to do it without you all.\u201d\n\u201cI had been thinking about joining the Navy for a while, but it seems impossible because you wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, even now I\u2019m not sure on what I want to do.\u201d\n\nEveryone else seems to look at each other as if they have been given a cue. Reed bumps Anon with his elbow to grab his attention, and notions Trish to head to the car.\n\n\u201cTrouble with career ideas, bro? You don\u2019t need to stress on it, man.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought about a few ideas.\u201d\n\nA nudging from behind steals Anon\u2019s attention from Reed. He looks to see Trish holding a-\n\nGuitar case?!\n\nTrish doesn\u2019t get the chance to talk before Anon grabs the case and quickly unlocks the hatches. He opens it up to reveal a stunning, brand new red electric guitar. Etched onto it was the VVURM DRAMA logo along with everyone\u2019s names written and faces doodled. This wasn\u2019t just some thrift-shop instrument, it was a brand new design with serious work put into it.\n\nAnon could only stare as Trish chuckles happily, finally getting to speak.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 we know that you\u2019ve been having some trouble looking for something to do when you get out of high school and all that\u2026\u201d\n\nAnon digs through the case more to find a VVURM DRAMA hoodie similar to Fang\u2019s top, also made just for him. A look in the compartment shows a heart-shaped pick with \u201cA+F\u201d scratched onto it. It looks to have been made by Fang herself. He continues to examine everything from the case, barely able to contain his racing thoughts. Out of every possible event that could have happened, this probably was the least expected. Trish lets out another chuckle at his reaction.\n\n\u201cHehe\u2026 and we were thinking of some solutions for you, and after some real careful consideration, we all wanted to ask you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnon, would you like to join our band?\"","encoded":false,"Title":"A Look Beyond The Shore","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed and

I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so upset, Anon.\u201d\n\nAnon and Naser push through the lunch line, several people shooting uncomfortable glances towards the track captain. Anon tries his best to grit his teeth, once again having to explain things to Naser.\n\n\u201cLook, Naser, just because a stereotype exists for a reason doesn\u2019t make it okay to say! You calling me a \u2018cave-dweller\u2019 just because my ancestors lived in a cave doesn\u2019t make it right, bro.\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh, I\u2019ll never understand you people.\u201d The one-winged racist grabs a tray for himself and Anon, slowly shuffling through the line of assembled student. \u201cFirst, we\u2019ve all got to sit through \u2018Skinne history month\u2019, then-\u201c\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s HUMAN history month, Naser.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever. Then, after you\u2019ve got a whole month for yourselves, you decide that we can\u2019t bring up the past anymore. I mean, what\u2019s up with that?\u201d Naser grabbed Anon a slice of pizza; actually, the last slice of pizza. He may be racist, but he looks out for his friends, at least.\n\n\u201cNaser, try to see it from my perspective. Would you want everyone going around spreading harmful stereotypes about you, no matter how innocent? Ignorance isn\u2019t an excuse for that kind of stuff, man.\u201d The two of them had reached the end of the lunch line, the unobservant staffer behind the register barely looking up from their magazine. \n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m not like, calling you a \u2018spear-chucker\u2019 or anything, it\u2019s just some banter man, lighten\u2019 up. Nah, I got this man.\u201d Naser handed the cashier a stack of bills, waving away Anon\u2019s attempt to pay for himself. Anon gripped the sides of his plastic lunch tray harder. Somehow, Naser\u2019s combination of seemingly casual racism was made all the worse by his insistent good deeds. Sure, Anon was thankful, but did Naser have to act like he did? \u201cBesides, it\u2019s a good thing! You people invented tools, brought us fire, loads of cool stuff!\u201d \n\nThe unlikely pair took a seat in the crowded lunchroom. Anon could only glare at Naser as he continued his diatribe around mouthfuls of his chicken parm. \u201cSo what if I bring up some of that stuff every once and a while? I don\u2019t mean anything of it!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it Naser, you not meaning anything doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t mean something to me!\u201d Anon gestured angrily at his companion with his pizza, flicking specks of grease across the table.\n\nSwallowing, Naser looked Anon straight in the eye. \u201cOkay, I didn\u2019t understand any of that stuff,\u201d he intoned, causing Anon to crash his head into the table in exasperation. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry if I offended you man, I\u2019ll like, buy you a Christmas present to make up for it, I promise.\u201d Naser reached over to give Anon what was probably meant to be a consoling pat on the shoulder. To Anon, it was just condescending. \n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t Naomi get on you for this, Naser? You\u2019d think she would want you to watch what you say.\u201d Anon settled back to his meal, attempting to discover the root of Naser\u2019s offensive sentiments.\n\n\u201cNah, she doesn\u2019t care. Fuck, she says wayyyy worse things when we\u2019re alone. Man, you should\u2019ve heard her this one time, Naser continued between bouts of laughter. \u201cShe said, \u2018if they\u2019re so smart, why didn\u2019t they evolve some thicker skin!\u201d Naser slapped the table, nearly doubling-over with laughter. \u201cEvolve! Skin! Classic\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, Naser, it doesn\u2019t make me feel good when you say those things! It really doesn\u2019t make me want to be your friend, either. Naser, Jesus man I\u2019m serious! I\u2019m being serious over here, and you\u2019re laughing!\u201d Naser\u2019s shoulders still quaked at his evolution joke, and no matter how hard he tried to somber up under Anon\u2019s angry glare, he couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. \n\n\u201cPfft hahahaha! Okay, okay, I\u2019m good, sorry Anon. Whew, just hits you sometimes, ya\u2019know?\u201d Naser finally calmed down, wiping a tear from his eye as he returned to his food. For a moment, the two of them ate in silence, each man intent on the food in front of them.\n\n\u201cDamn, this chicken is already cold.\u201d Naser gave his chicken parm another questing poke with his spork.\n\n\u201cServes you right, for what you said.\u201d Anon replied, tearing another bite of his pizza off.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Anon, you mind building me a fire to warm this up? I\u2019m kidding, I\u2019m kidding!\u201d Naser had to reach out to grab Anon\u2019s sleeve to prevent him from storming off, laughing all the while as he pulled his human friend back to the table. \u201cLook, no more human jokes, I promise, okay?\u201d Anon stood there, glowering back at Naser\u2019s innocent face for a moment before huffily sitting back down.\n\n\u201cFine. But no more human jokes, or cracks about fire, or tools, or any of that shit!\u201d Naser held up his hands, palms outward in the universal sign of surrender. Their truce was temporary, however, as Naser just couldn\u2019t help himself. \n\n\u201cSo, monkey jokes are still on?\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Anon slammed his hands on the table, sending their lunch trays bouncing as Naser erupted into laughter. \u201cGo ahead, make your funny little racist jokes. That\u2019s cool. You wanna know why, Naser?\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ve evolved past them?\u201d More laughter from the dino, more scowling from the human.\n\n\u201cBecause I have something you\u2019ll never have, something that your sister seems very interested in.\u201d Anon\u2019s emphasis on \u2018sister\u2019 made Naser shut up quickly. Leaning over the table, Anon got real close to his would-be-friend, letting the silence drag on for a moment. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. You wanna know what Fang likes about me?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy HOT. MONKEY. DICK! That\u2019s right, I\u2019ve been FUCKING your sister in a way you scalie SHITS could never do!\u201d Anon was shouting at this point, all eyes in the lunch room on him. \u201cYou wanna know what girls like, Naser? A nice smooth human cock! In fact, I\u2019m gonna go find Fang and FUCK her with it right now!\u201d With that, Anon stormed off from the table, kicking the lunchroom doors open with a clatter.\n\nNaser just sat there, silently matching the stares from the other students. One by one they turned back, eager to move on from the embarrassing scene. No one was close enough to hear Naser whisper, however.  \n\n\u201cAt last, the family bloodline is secured.\u201d","encoded":false,"Title":"Anon And Naser - Casual Racism","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Naser and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Anon, Fang, Reed, Trish \u2013 Dinoland.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Anon, Fang, Reed, Trish \u2013 Dinoland.txt"],"text":"Title: Anon, Fang, Reed, Trish \u2013 Dinoland\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Trish, Reed and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nThe afternoon waned, the incessant ticking of the clock slowly driving me insane.

Sitting here on this shitty basement couch, subtly dropping hints that no one understands!\n\nHeaving another heavy sigh, I idly flip through the pages I have saved on my phone: Dinoland pricing, the best route to get there, cheap motels we could stay at. So much for my grand plan of inviting the gang over to hang out in my basement, just to make a dramatic announcement that this summer, we\u2019re finally taking that road trip we always wanted to take. At least, the road trip I always wanted to take\u2026\n\nGlancing over at Anon, I can\u2019t help but feel the familiar butterflies in my stomach once more. Somehow that stupid dweeb had captured my heart, and now every time I sneak a peak of him, it feels like\u2026 Well, like I\u2019m looking at the person I want to be with. God, why does he have to be so hot?!\n\n\u201cUghhh, you guys are so lame!\u201d My exaggerated groan and full-body flop onto the floor does little to distract Anon and Reed from the screen. Fuckin\u2019 boys. At least Trish glanced up from her nails, her face creasing in irritation. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we dooooooooo something? Instead of just sitting in the dark?\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u2019cool in here, Fang. Besides, man, this place is chill.\u201d Thank you Reed, for your input. We could leave you in the freezer at Dino-Moe\u2019s and you\u2019d be alright as long as you had your Xrox.\n\n\u201cYeah, Fang, it\u2019s too hot to do anything outside.\u201d Trish blew on her nails, now a brilliant share of golden yellow, complete with glitter. \u201cI guess we could go to the beach again, but, like, I JUST did my nails. See? Aren\u2019t they cute?!\u201d Trish holds her completed work out to me, smiling. I manage to bite off the growl rising in my throat and give her a non-committal noise instead. I know she didn\u2019t mean to on purpose, but sometimes the way Trish flaunted just how pretty she was made me fucking pissed.\n\n\u201cThanks a lot you fucks, real great help here. Anon, can you back me up, dweeb?\u201d He was my last desperate lifeline. If I could get him on board with the idea, the others would have no other choice but to tag along.\n\nAnon stayed silent for a moment, his lips moving slightly. We all waited, glancing at him, accustomed to the way that stupid dweeb always thought out his words before saying anything. Sometimes, when he mumbled, it was like a precursor to the real thing, a warm-up act of stupidity before the real dipshit band took the stage.\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose it wouldn\u2019t be too bad to get out there.\u201d The uncomfortable edge in his voice made me smile. Anon never took off his jacket, despite the fact that it was like, a million degrees outside right now. Summer was not kind to dweebs like him. \u201cSure, Fang, let\u2019s do something!\u201d\n\n\u201cYesssssssssss!\u201d I couldn\u2019t help myself from double-fist punching the sky, laughing as I nearly took out the stand lamp that sat next to the couch.\n\n\u201cDid you have something in mind, Fang?\u201d Reed manage to pull himself away from the screen at last, immediately searching for what he called his \u2018signature dish\u2019. We all know it\u2019s carfe, Reed.\n\n\u201cNo beach! And I ain\u2019t climbing the bluff again, not with these nails, nuh-uh.\u201d We get it Trish, your nails look great. Bitch.\n\nAnon crossed the room, sitting next to me on the floor. I quickly pulled my phone to my chest, hiding the screen from him. \u201cYeah Fang, what have you been planning?\u201d I could tell he suspected something, the way he was grinning. The butterflies in my stomach started to beat faster.\n\nDamnit Anon, you and your stupid grin!\n\n\u201cUmmm, well\u2026\u201d I could feel my face blushing under their stares. Suddenly, the idea of a day in Dinoland sounded kinda\u2019 lame, even to me. I mean, we just graduated high school! We should be out getting shit-faced on beer and shit, not going to an amusement park for little kids. I could feel myself start to spiral, palms sweaty as I hide my face. Would they even like the idea?  \n\n\u201cHey, babe, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Anon placed a comforting hand on my knee. \u201cWhatever you wanna do, I\u2019m down for it.\u201d This time, his smile was warm and reassuring, the same one that had comforted me through so much these past few months.\n\nDamnit Anon!\n\nTaking a deep breath, I pull my phone away from my chest, thumbing the password in. \u201cOkay, this is gonna sound totally lame, but, I was think we could, maybe, go to\u2026 Dinoland?\u201d The shocked expression on their faces made me stammer out my next bit like a frazzled little kid. \u201cI mean, ironically, right? Like, who would wanna go to such a lame place? Hahaha!\u201d \n\nReed stroked his chin, his eyes already matching the color of his skin. \u201cIt could be kinda\u2019 fun to sneak into one of those mascot costumes.\u201d \n\nTrish blew an errant strand of curls out of her face, clearly nonplussed at my idea. \u201cYeah, maybe if we go just to see how lame it is.\u201d \n\nAnon just smiled, reaching out for my hand. For a second we just sat there, holding each other, before he chimed in. \u201cI think that\u2019s a great idea, Fang. An ironic Dinoland road trip!\u201d \n\nI gave Anon a smile, feeling my face begin to redden again. I knew he knew that I didn\u2019t want to go there ironically at all, but I didn\u2019t care. All that mattered to me is that we were going together.

And he needed to find something to him calm down. Now this had not been his first choice, but as he pulled the Nascar up to Reed\u2019s van Naser knew he would need this for the coming days. Getting out of his car, Naser strolled up and knocked on the van\u2019s side shakily. The large door slid open and a pink raptor peeked his head out. \u201cYo Naser! You accepted my invite. Nice.\u201d Reed said waving Naser inside. Naser climbed on in and crouched to the side of Reed who closed the door and turned to him. \n\n     \u201cLook bro I know how hard it\u2019s been for ya, so I\u2019m glad you came to have a nice few puffs with me. It\u2019ll calm ya right down bro, no long-term addiction guaranteed. And if you need to offload some shit on a bro I\u2019ll be right here. Taking a trip with ya.\u201d \n\n      Naser was still hesitant. He told himself this was a one-time thing and he would never sink this low again. If anything, the thought of his father\u2019s retribution held him to that. They both took a seat at the back of the van. Reed wasted no time in taking out a bong, bringing his lighter up under it, and inhaling the first vapes. Then he lazily passed it to Naser who hesitated a few seconds before remembering all he had been through with handling Naomi and his sister the last few years and he finally took the boof. Inhaling it like the newbie he was and coughing hard until he learned to pace himself.\n\n      The world became blurry and Naser gave a droopy smile. He now understood that Reed was living the good life. No nagging control freak of a girlfriend, never letting him do anything she didn\u2019t expressively approve of. Even after high school she controlled everything down to their sex life, not letting him have release until she felt it was right! What a bitch! In Naser\u2019s now drug addled state his mind was free from his usual inhibitions and a need to release all his stress would no longer be stopped by a now nonexistent self-control.     \n \n     Naser slowly unbuckled his pants and dragged them and his undergarments down to his knees with his thumbs. Letting his gene inherited thick, spear like, black shaft, grow to full erection. Reed, who was on cloud nine, registered the phallic sight in blurry detail. Quickly snapping him back to earth as Naser began working his hands up and down his dino pecker, drool running down from the bottom of the man\u2019s beak. Reed now understood that this was a far more serious bro problem than he had first suspected. A full five alarm emergency of a bro in need! \n\n       Sliding around to Naser\u2019s front view, Reed looked him dead in the eyes and asked \u201cDude. Mind if a bro helped you out?\u201d Naser\u2019s face seemed to return to lucidity for a quick moment and his face reddened. Though after moment\u2019s contemplation, he sheepishly nodded. Reed\u2019s caring eyes drifted down to Naser\u2019s throbbing member. \u201cYea don\u2019t you worry bro I\u2019ll take that pent up stress for ya.\u201d After uttering those final words Reed kneeled down and gently slid his body back to the point that his snout was at Naser\u2019s groin and his upper body in-between his legs. \n\n       Reed took things calmly, wrapping his arms around Naser\u2019s thighs and planting his hands on each of his buttocks. Finally, Reed opened his mouth and lowered it around Naser\u2019s impressive member. His tongue started off pressing down on the top of the now sweaty saft and then easing down the side before circling the entire dick. Swiftly Slickening the dick in its repetitive course while Reed\u2019s jaws closed slowly and he began to bob his head up and down. Getting closer to the base of Naser\u2019s dick each time. A passionate sound erupted from Naser\u2019s mouth, A low deep moaning that ended in a sigh. Tears building from the edges of his eyes. \n\n       Reed dutifully went on for a few more minutes like this. And though some precum was tasted, Reed could not bring Naser to his climax. The man must have been hard trained by Naomi; Reed concluded. Something more had to be done. Lifting up his head, Reed stood up and turned. Naser looked at Reed pleadingly, worried that he had stopped. Though his eyes went wide when he saw Reed bend over and slip his pants down over his tail and then dropped them to the floor entirely. The pink raptor twink then sensually raised his tail high. Showing his shapely, soft, though still form keeping ass. Reed\u2019s head looked back over his shoulder and his jaws parted to let out a ring of smoke. Which Naser saw as a heart in his inebriated state. \n\n         Naser was now sweating bullets and tore off his jacket in a vain attempt to cool down. As he did this, Reed lowered himself quite carefully down onto Naser\u2019s rock hard shaft. Reed\u2019s ass cheeks hugged his pole comfortably on its trip to Reed\u2019s exit. Given how wet the shaft now was it was a tight but quick pop of an insertion. Not wanting to treat Naser the same as Naomi had. Reed began to quickly pump up and down on Naser\u2019s bone. Soft ass slapped against Naser\u2019s groin as Reed\u2019s long, fluffy tail swayed up and down in sync with the bouncing.\n\n       \u201cReed\u2026. I\u201d Naser said in-between huffs and puffs. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2019 sweat it bro, just giving you what you need\u201d Reed said through strained grunts. Reed felt a powerful tensing in the shaft that was now deep inside him and brought his ass down fully one final time. Naser let out a strong gasp as a wave of pure bliss and heat smothered him and he at last came hard. Load after load shot deep into Reed quivering ass, seemingly never ending. Causing his tail to curl up around Naser\u2019s body. The cum entering Reed felt thick and hot, but cooling fast. The two bros sat connected like so for a time. Riding both the afterglow of the intercourse and the drugs. \n\n        At last Reed found the strength to dislodge himself from Naser and stood up. And Naser pulled his pants back up after cleaning off any residual cum that hadn\u2019t stayed inside his bro. He then stood up, collected his jacket and opened up the Van door. Giving one look back at Reed, Naser tried to get out a sentence. \u201cReed\u2026. look about this\u2026\u201d \n\n       \u201cDon\u2019t harp on it dude, A bro\u2019s gotta do what a bro\u2019s gotta do.\u201d Interrupted Reed, doing his classic Finger bang towards Naser. The shaken Naser gave a curt nod and let a little smile show as he walked back to his Nascar. Now knowing that drugs might not be his only new addiction to worry about.

He had mixed signals about that house. It contained the love of his life and potentially the end of his life, at the end of a golf club. At least he wouldn\u2019t be alone, because this was a sleepover! Childish sounding as it may be. It was also necessary. Recently a human gang war had broken out on skin row and Anon doubted the safety of his crappy apartment.\n\n    With him walked the pink smokestack known commonly as Reed. Apparently, his place had burned down due to no fault of his own, which Anon had serious doubts on. Both refuges carried only the essentials. Sleeping bags, PJs, and dental care. Though Anon suspected Reed had something extra in his backpack. A bold move considering Naser\u2019s dad resided at their destination. Hopefully they would not all die from Reed\u2019s mistakes.\n \n    Ten minutes later and the two were walking up to the front porch. Anon was going to let Reed knock but realized he had made an error as Reed just swayed in one spot, seemingly in another world. So, he stepped up and took the risk, tapping away on the door. A low groan emanated from a dazed Reed, causing Anon to look back as he continued to absent mindlessly knock. Right after he did the door opened and Anon failed to stop himself in time as his hand knocked onto a snoot. The one that belonged to Fang\u2019s dad. \n\n      Looking back with a face of pants shitting fear. Anon quickly retreated from the Angry Father. Fang\u2019s old man raised an accusatory finger at the boys. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my boy\u2019s generosity I\u2026.\u201d He was interrupted by his less murderous wife slipping in front of him. \u201cOh my! What fine young gentlemen, so kind of my Naser to invite you over this evening! Come in come in, I\u2019ve made snacks.\u201d With that she turned and dragged her husband inside with her. \n\n     Reed shrugged at the momentarily petrified Anon and went inside. Anon hesitantly following. There Anon saw Naser, Fang\u2019s mom, and Dad sitting in the living room. With Reed already moving to take a load off. Still feeling the need for self-preservation Anon sat in the chair with the most distance from Naser\u2019s Dad. Surprisingly Fang was not present. Anon made to quietly ask Naser, who was sitting nearby, but Naser knew that question was coming and whispered \u201cGirl problems\u201d And that was the end of that inquiry.\n\n       \u201cOkay boys it\u2019s already late so have your snacks, head up to Naser\u2019s room, and set up your shit there. And I\u2019m a light sleeper so no funny business!\u201d Said Naser\u2019s Dad, scanning the three for any signs of weakness. He seemed satisfied enough with the fearful looks he got. At least he thought that Reed was giving off that look, hard to tell. That boy wasn\u2019t right. He then got up and left the group to go polish his golf club collection. While Fang\u2019s mom said her good nights and went off to find a quit place to read.\n\n        This left the boys on their own as they finished the cookies Fang\u2019s mom had left out. \u201cSo, bro\u2019s I got this sweat new shit I\u2019ve been meaning to\u2026\u201d Reed started, reaching towards his bag. \u201cReed for the love of Raptor Jesus please.\u201d Naser implored. Anon went pale and started muttering things. Reed pulled his hands up and smiled. \u201cJust messing with ya bros. It\u2019s my Xrox in there.\u201d \n\n       \u201cReed I don\u2019t have a TV in my room.\u201d Naser replied. Reed looked disappointed but took a quick puff of something he took from his pocket and went back to a dazed state. Naser sighed and lead the two up to his room. His bedroom was just big enough for Reed and anon to roll out their sleeping bags a reasonable distance away from each other. Reed took the side closest to Naser\u2019s bed and Anon the side of the wall. After that they took turns heading off to the bathroom to get changed. Anon\u2019s PJs were plain green while Naser\u2019s was somehow the same pattern he had on his jacket. And Reeds was pink with a pattern of small joint smoking T-rex\u2019s covering the entirety of it. \n\n         Naser took a glance at Reed and seemed nervous, well a different kind of nervous. Though Anon was to socially inept to pick up on anything. \u201cYo bro you\u2019re looking stressed, if you need any help\u2026\u201d Reed began.\n       \u201cNo Reed I\u2019m fine, now we need to get some sleep. It\u2019s gonna be hard enough to achieve as soon as Fang starts going off on her guitar.\u201d Naser interrupted. Anon didn\u2019t feel the need to get involved. He had to get up early to run some errands anyway. Naser clicked the lights off and everyone got under their covers. Reed almost instantly started snoring so it took a bit for Anon to achieve slumber but the muffled sound of fangs guitar a few rooms down finally helped him sleep. \n\n       Only for him to wake up a few hours later into the night to see Naser tossing and turning in his bed. Clearly having a rough time of things. Reed was up to, and slowly crawling up the side of the bed! Anon\u2019s eyes went wide, followed by him quietly muttering to himself and seemingly coming to a decision to remain silent, closing his eyes only halfway. Reed continued his climb until his body was held up by his arms directly over Naser\u2019s own. Naser stopped turning and laid straight, his eyes snapping open. Amazingly, he didn\u2019t immediately scream in horror and thrash around. Instead, he sighed and looked into Reeds now gentle eyes and spoke. \u201cReed\u2026 we can\u2019t do this again and not with Anon right over there.\u201d\n\n       \u201cBro you need this tonight. A bro can tell.\u201d Reed said, looking down at Naser\u2019s groin where a stiff tent had been pitched. \u201cDammit fine\u2026bro but you got to start helping me with my stress in more discreet places then my house.\u201d Naser relented. Reed nodded apologetically and backed on down to his bro\u2019s crotch. Where he slowly pulled down Naser\u2019s pants, letting his long rod spring out. He then reached into his bag beside the bed and brought out a bottle of lube. Covering his hands in the stuff before setting to work methodically pumping Naser\u2019s member. Naser let out a few sporadic gasps and groans. Bringing a wry smile to Reed\u2019s face. \n\n     \u201cTime to be a real bro.\u201d Reed said sensually. Now that Naser\u2019s dick was lubed as can be, Reed took things further. Pulling his owns jams down and swaying his tail hypnotically. He put his arms around behind Naser\u2019s shoulders and used them as grips as he positioned his smooth, light pink, rear over Naser\u2019s crotch before lowering himself down. Naser\u2019s face was a mix of embarrassed and aroused as he looked into Reed\u2019s face. Reed returned the look with a droozy smile and rapidly bouncing eyebrows. The rut started out with Reed doing most of the work, coming up and down on his bro\u2019s dick as pre started to dribble from the tip of his own.\n\n      Then something awakened in Naser, an expression conveying intense lust overcame his face and his hips started bucking. Thrusting hard like a jack hammer into Reed. It was now Reed\u2019s turned to gasp and let out a shaky moan. Intense muttering was faintly heard from the corner of the room before a new weight was felt on the bed and hands reached around either side of Reed and grabbed his dick. \u201cYou need a bro for yourself Reed.\u201d He heard Anon say while the human\u2019s hands started jerking him off. \n\n      It did not take long at this pace for Reed and Naser to reach their climaxes. Reed came first. He groaned deeply as his load shot forwards into Naser\u2019s face. Naser tried to close his mouth but a little of Reed\u2019s seed got in first before he swallowed and came. Pumping Reed full of pent up spooge. Reed\u2019s ass cheeks clenched and he happily took all of his bro\u2019s burden. Everyone clenched their respective cheeks harder when the light to Naser\u2019s room turned on. The trio\u2019s heads swiveled around to see Fang\u2019s Dad standing in the doorway. The big man had a thousand-yard stare in his eyes and he took one long chug of his beer can, staring Naser in the eyes for a moment before flicking the light off and slamming the door shut in front of him. \n\n        Everyone\u2019s face was beet red and they slowly dislodged from each other. Doing a quick clean up in silence and going back to bed. There was no more movement from Naser. The next morning Reed was already gone before Anon woke up. Naser only gave him a look as if to convey the importance of never saying what had happened here. Anon concluded that he and Reed would no longer be sleeping in Naser\u2019s room and made quick work of gathering his things. On his way out he had one more encounter with Fang\u2019s father. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t have to worry about you and Fang after all. But stay away from Naser or this Club will be going up your ass no lube!\u201d He yelled as Anon bolted out the door. A confused Fang looking out the window of her room at her escaping boyfriend.

I'm starting to think Fang wasn't joking when she said I needed to butter him up with a couple of cheap romance novels if I wanted to get anywhere. My fruitless attempts of bargaining with Carl already eating up several precious minutes that could be spent hanging with my ptero girlfriend. I pick up the pace and head straight for the cafeteria. As I open the cafeteria doors I'm greeted by a veritable cacophony of sounds and smells. Luckily finding where Fang and company are sitting isn't hard. The monochromatic ptero acts like a beacon in a sea of clown vomit. The Fang gang are busy eating their lunch as I approach their table. I put my backpack on the table and take a seat next to Fang. As I rummage between school supplies for the food I packed away at home, the others notice my presence. Fang is the first to speak up.\n\"So, how did it go?\"\n\"I got nowhere, it was like talking to a brick wall.\"\n\"You went empty-handed, didn't you?\"\n\"I still think you're fucking with me.\"\nReed finishes sipping with carfe concoction and chimes in.\n\"Nah bro, the Carlmeister doesn't do anything for nothing. Everyone knows that\"\nThe pink raptor pulls out his phone and begins entering his comically long password.\n\"Don't worry, I'll hook you up with a link to the spreadsheet of what students have already gotten him. It's what friends are for.\"\nTrish looks up from her meal, the purple triggers face is unusually pale.\n\"The last thing you want to do is waste money on something Carldelewski already has. Believe me, it doesn't end well.\"\n\nI honestly couldn't believe what I was hearing. But if spending a couple of bucks on some trashy romance novels will help me bump up my grades, I might as well try. Finally finding my meager lunch, I place a couple of small sandwiches and a can on the table. Before I can even begin with final assembly, Fang has already snatched the can out from under my nose. \n\"What the hell is this Anon, are you honestly gonna put whipped cream on your sandwich? Is this some weird human thing I should know about?\"\nI try to respond, but with Fang giving me a particularly sultry look while shaking the can, my mouth refuses to cooperate. Instead, I'm struggling to not think about licking whipped cream off of Fangs' tummy. I manage to resist the urge, but just barely. I mentally become present just in time to see Fang press down on the plastic, spraying the contents of the can into her mouth. It takes less than a second, but her smug expression is replaced with that of shock. Unfortunately, Fang was so convinced there was whipped cream in the can, that her mind had already queued up swallowing. Shock gives way to regret, Fangs' amber eyes mist over with tears as her brain begins processing the foulness her taste buds are experiencing. She slams down the can and begins coughing and choking. \n\"What the fuck was that Anon!? I thought we said no more pranks!\"\nDesperate to get the taste out of her mouth she starts drinking anything she can get her hands on. Reed is still spaced out, unperturbed by Fangs' extreme reaction. Trish on the other hand is furious. \n\"What the fuck is wrong with you, you dumb ape? What's in that can?\"\nI know canned cheese is an acquired taste reserved for poor schmucks like me, but still, it can't be that bad. \n\"It's just cheez whiz, I don't know what the big deal is.\"\nThe purple triceratops suspiciously eyes the can before picking it up\n\"Let me give it a try. Maybe it's just horrible for omnivores\"\nTrish sprays a tiny amount of the canned cheese onto her finger and puts it into her mouth. Reacting even faster than Fang, Trish instantly has both hands over her mouth and starts running towards the nearest restroom. \n\nFang has somewhat recovered from what is apparently dino repellent and starts staring angrily at the overturned can on the table.\n\"That shit is evil. Whoever made it should be executed for crimes against all life.\"\nReed snaps out from whatever daydream he was having and picks up the can.\n\"Can I try bro?\"\n\"Sure, just don't blame me if it makes you sick.\"\nThe stoner sticks out his tongue and sprays a little bit of the contents of the can onto it. This time there is no retching, coughing, or barely restrained puking. Instead, Reed opens his mouth and empties the entire can into it. He chomps down, a look of pure delight on his face. Fang looks at the bands' drummer in horror, unable to understand why anyone would willingly eat so much of that horrible goop. \n\"Heh, sorry man, guess I got a bit carried away. That's some good shit though. Got any more?\"\n\"No,\" I sigh, \"Glad at least someone liked it though.\"\nWe finish lunch period in relative silence. Fang is still traumatized, small whimpers escaping her snoot every so often as she relives the ordeal. Reed went back to daydreaming, although with a slight smile this time. I do my best to cope with my dry lunch, sipping water between every bite to help it go down. Trish never returned, so Fang picks up her bag as we go to our separate classes.\n\nThe last period ends and students begin pouring out of the building. As I go down the long stairs of the main entrance, I spot all three members of Vvurm Drama chatting near the sidewalk. The girls are busy talking about some girly stuff, but Fang does brush me with one of her wings to acknowledge my presence. Reed on the other hand can't wait to talk to me. \n\"Anon, I've been thinking about that canned cheese all day. Think you can hook a brother up?\"\n\"Can't you just go and buy it yourself? It's just sprayed cheese.\"\n\"Come on man, don't be like that. I'll make it worth your while.\"\nReed opens up his wallet and pulls out a 50 dollar bill. He quickly shoves it into my hands like we're doing something illegal. \n\"I'll be expecting you to deliver tomorrow.\"\nWithout waiting for my reply Reed just gives the rest of the gang a wave and heads to his car. I do the same and head for the bus stop. Reed's a weird dude, but if getting him a couple of cans of cheez whiz will make him happy, then I don't see why not. \n\nThe next day I don't even bother talking to Mr. Carldelewski. I'm still waiting for the books I ordered online to arrive before I try my luck again. Fang texted me to not bother looking for the band in the cafeteria and instead come to the auditorium. Thank god, I'm already getting some weird looks. My backpack is about to burst and the clinking of metal is not helping at all. The loud creak of the auditorium door signals my arrival and Fang waves me over the moment she sees me. I barely take my seat next to her when Reed rushes over.\n\"Did you get the goods?\"\nI open my backpack and start handing him several cans at a time. In the end, Reed is holding 13 cans of cheez whiz and looks like he just won the lottery.\n\"That's all they had in the store.\" I start taking out my wallet to give him back the change.\n\"Nah bro, the rest is for your troubles.\" He quickly stashes the cans in his backpack. All except for one, which he sprays on top of a cup filled with carfe. Fangs' shudders entire body shudders and she becomes somehow even paler. Trish on the other hand has to look away before her stomach can refund her lunch.\n \nI nudge Fang in the arm to get her attention. \n\"I got something for you too, a peace offering so we don't restart the prank war.\"\nI give her a small box, still warm to the touch. Fang is cautious at first until she picks up the smell of the contents inside the box. She then immediately tears apart the box and starts devouring the dino nuggets inside. \n\"Fine, peace,\" she gulps down another nugget, \"But only because your offering pleases me.\"\n\"But wait, there's more!\"\nI pull out another can, this one clearly labeled as whipped cream. Fang puts down her almost empty nugget box and takes the can. Not entirely convinced I'm not just pranking her again, she gives the can a quick shake before spraying it onto my nose. Satisfied that I'm not tricking her, she licks it off of my nose with her long tongue. I'm completely frozen in place, which only amuses the ptero even more. Trish can't take the lovey-dovey shit anymore and decides to make her annoyance known. \n\"Get a room you two!\"\nHer words snap me out of my mindlock.\n\"Quit whining, I got something for you too!\"\nI pull out the last foodstuff from my backpack which is now practically empty. I toss the head of lettuce towards Trish who just barely manages to catch it. \n\"You might want to wash it first.\" My advice goes unheeded and Trish begins munching on the salad leaves. At least it's organic. With both the bandmates busy eating, Fang leans towards me.\n\"You know Anon, it's not such a bad idea. My parents won't be home for a few hours after school.\" Her voice takes on a husky tone. \"Maybe I could give you another guitar lesson.\" Fang giggles when she sees my face turn bright red. She pulls me close to make sure only I can hear her next words.\n\"You might want to buy more whipped cream on the way though.\"","encoded":false,"Title":"Culinary Enrichment","Status":"Completed","Characters":"Fang, Reed, Trish and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Author":"Anonymous","Summary":"Anon brings lunch to school, to the horror of most of his friends"},"Date Night Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Date Night Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: Date Night\nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Fang, Samantha, Ripley and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: Capri\n\n\nDate Night part 1\n\n\"I'm almost ready, so be here in about uh... half an hour.\"\n\"Alright, see ya then Sweet Tooth.\"\n\"Oh shut up you c-\" she trails off for a bit before the call ends. Even after all this time, that nickname hasn't lost its effect; you could practically feel her blushed cheeks through the phone, a reward worth the immediate cringe that overtakes you whenever you say it. More importantly, she said she'd be ready in half an hour, so that's about an hour of shitposting before you need to leave. Having gone on plenty of dates with Fang taught you the hard way how much time she needs to get ready, and her dad made sure you'd be able to feel every uncomfortable second of it. On the bright side, you know a lot more about golf now, to the point where you can actually hold a conversation with him, should you need to distract him from bashing your head in with his club for whatever reason.\n\nThe bus ride was short, your thoughts still on those posts you made on that Slovenian Femboy Meetup forum. It really doesn't take much to rile them up, you think to yourself, choking back a laugh and probably looking like a retard to the other passengers. Stepping out, you're greeted by the now familiar sight of Fang's street. You begin to wonder what you'll be doing this evening. She usually makes the plans, since she's lived here all her life and knows all the cool hangout spots. You can't complain though, there haven't been too many misses, and in your book any time spent with Fang is a good time. A minute or two later you're knocking on the door, on time you hope. The door is opened by Sam, Fang's mom, and she gestures you to come in.\n\"Oh, good evening Anon! How are you sweetie?\"\n\"Quite alright. It's been a splendid day today after all.\" I put on the best suburban posh display I could muster. I don't think I could ever pull it off naturally but she doesn't seem to mind.\n\"Indeed, good to hear! I trust you're here for Fang? She ought to be ready any minute now.\". Damn, still to early, I guess I have no choice but to..\n\"Ripley's in the living room if you want to chat. If you need anything I'll be in the kitchen.\"\n\"Alright, thank you.\" I respond trying to hide my dejection.\nOh boy, here we go. You're a train operator now, on the flimsiest rails in the world. Time to do your best to avoid a train-wreck. You nervously make your way to the living room, where you find Ripley, sitting in his armchair, absent-mindedly flipping through channels, still in his police uniform. He turns his gaze to you, then gestures towards the couch. You follow his lead and sit down, desperately trying to appear as relaxed as possible.\n\"Hey, Anon\" he says in the same indecipherable tone he always uses. At this point you can't help but think he's using it only to fuck with you.\n\"Hello sir, how are you.\" you're sweating bullets already, and your voice almost cracked. This is terrible. You need to get out of here as fast as possible. Where's Fang? How much longer 'til she's done?\n\"How many times have I told you boy, you can call me Ripley\" he laughs as he shifts in his seat. \"I'm doing just fine, came from work about a half hour ago.\"\n\"Anything exciting?\" grasping at straws to keep that dreadful silence I know all too well from creeping in.\n\"Nothing much, just paperwork, although I suppose that's a good thing, eh\" he chuckles. \"Say, you're pretty well dressed, you guys going anywhere fancy?\" You're taken aback by the sudden compliment, although it's true that shirts aren't in your usual repertoire, and this IS the nicest pair of jeans you have.\n\"I don't know where we're going actually\" you answer after composing yourself. \"She usually tells me where we're supposed to be going beforehand, but this time she was very cryptic about it.\"\n\"Sounds like she's got a surprise cooking\" he states, very matter-of-factly, before turning his attention back to the TV.\nA few minutes pass in silence, as he goes from channel to channel, trying to find anything even half-interesting. Suddenly, his face contorts with an unreadable cocktail of emotions. Looking to see what's got him so agitated, you see a replay of yesterday's PDGA golf tournament final. \"Oh.\" the sound of realization escapes from your mouth before you can catch it, and Ripley looks at you quizzically. \" 'ave you watched the match yesterday?\". You have, along with the rest of the tournament. Being informed on your girlfriend's dad's favorite sport is important for your well-being; everybody knows that. More urgently, he seems to be expecting you to comment on the outcome of the game. Your next sentence could make or break you.\n\"Yeah I've seen it. Cynodont Woods really fucked up those last few shots huh.\"\n\"Right? Even you could've putted some of those! And he still won. Bah!\" he scoffs.\n\nauthor note: look up golf shitposting on \/sp\/\n\nA few more minutes pass, as Ripley comments on various plays in the match, as well as ranting about different aspects of golf in general. You struggle to catch all of it, but he seems to be enjoying himself, so the occasional nod and 'I see' is all you need to satisfy him. Soon enough you hear someone coming down the stairs, and into the living-room struts Fang. You look at her and your jaw immediately drops. All of this waiting was worth it, you think. She's wearing white shirt with a black vest on top, tucked into a mesmerizing pleated dress, which, combined with the distinctly elegant leather boots she's wearing, accentuate the curves of her legs. To top it all off she's wearing the pendant you gave her way back, which gives you a heart boner like you've never had before. You stare in disbelief, having been reminded just how lucky of a guy you really are.\n\"You gonna gawk all night or can we go?\" Fang chuckles as she drags you up from the couch and towards the door. As you get your bearings you see the patriarch adopt a stern look as he furrows his brow.\n\"I trust you know the drill already.\"\nYou don't hesitate to respond. \"Yessir. Home by 10pm, either she gets here safe and happy or I go home in a body bag.\". You quickly stand at attention and do a soldier's salute, which prompts Fang to roll her eyes, and her dad to smile.\n\"Hah! Atta boy! Have fun you two!\" he howls before turning back to the TV.\n\"Come on Sweet Tooth, let's go\". A flash of annoyance and embarrassment on Fangs face signal that I've hit my target yet again. It really never gets old.\n\"Pftt. Shut up.\" she exits the house through the door you've opened like the true gentleman you are, and you follow suit.

I'm slowly dragged into consciousness, grumbling in annoyance as I squirm away from the light, burying myself deeper into the covers. Alas, it seems there's no escape, every spot I find harshly illuminated within moments. I roll away from that accursed window, shuffling closer to that familiar weight on the other side of the bed. I can feel the gentle rise of her chest as I drape my arm around her, burying my face in the soft downy feathers of her wings. The soothing sound of her breathing and the chirping of the birds outside are all I need to doze off again, content to sleep the morning away. \nEventually Fang stirs slightly in my arms, the rhythm of her breaths hitching for a moment. Her legs stretch under the covers as she yawns, her snout snapping shut as she wiggles against me. With a deep contented sigh she leans back into my chest, taking my hand in hers and gently stroking my fingers.\n\n\"Mornin' dweeb...\" She sleepily yawns again, using her favorite little private pet-name.\n\n\"Mhrrgh...\" I grumble into her wings, her shoulders shaking as Fang chuckles. She continues stroking my hand, her tail squirming as it tries to happily wag beneath the covers. The two of us lay there, gently dozing on and off as the morning sun rises, filling the bedroom with golden light. Warm air blows in from the window, carrying the sound of the neighborhood slowly beginning to wake up. Somewhere in the distance a windchime blows in the breeze, a gentle melody of metallic tones just barely audible on the wind.\n\nThe cool evening air we enjoyed the night before is slowly pushed out by the bright morning sun, the room gradually growing warmer. Reluctantly, Fang and I separate, shrugging off the thickest of the covers as we gradually wake up. Fang takes the opportunity to roll over and face me, her sleepy amber eyes shining under her tangled bangs. She just smiles at me, no words necessary to convey the feeling of completeness she knows we both share right now. Unable to help myself, I lean over and plant a kiss on the top of her snout. Fang laughs and tries to squirm away from my affections, playfully planting a hand on my chest. \"Hey, c'mon. Let me shower first, I'm a mess.\"\n\n\"You're beautiful.\" I retort, tickling her sides as I pepper her face with kisses. Fang eventually pushes herself free, planting a retaliatory kiss on my forehead as we settle down. Our fingers interlock under the sheets as we stare into each other's eyes, unwilling to get up just quite yet. Fang snuggles back into her pillow, her eyelids drooping as she decides to catch just a bit more sleep. I stay with her, content to watch the slow rise and fall of her shoulders, memorizing the peaceful look on her face as she nods off. I pretend not to notice the soft footsteps on the carpet coming from the hallway, until a little weight jump onto the mattress behind me. Fang jolts awake as tiny hands are planted on my shoulder, rocking me back and worth from behind.\n\n\"Daaaaaaad, get up!\" A lovely little voice whines from behind me, my chest swelling every time I hear it.  A second pair of amber eyes looks down at me from above, her face silhouetted in a halo of shortly cropped silver hair. She pouts adorably, her indignant expression undercut somewhat by the fluffy pink pajamas she's wearing. She shakes my shoulder again, apparently not convinced I'm quite awake yet.\n\n\"C'mon Dad, it's ten in the morning! You promised to make pancakes today!\" She pleads, her argument infallible. With an exaggerated groan I roll over, planting my face down into the pillow as Fang laughs at me. Our daughter is undeterred, getting down on all fours to get close to my face. Little does she know, she's fallen right into my trap. My arm springs out like a snake, wrapping around her waist and pulling her close as she squeals in surprise. There's no escape for her as I mercilessly blow raspberries against her neck, her legs kicking against the covers as she laughs in delight. Just when she thinks I've relented, my fingers snake their way into her armpit, her laughter redoubling as I exploit her weakness. I easily hold her tight as she struggles, letting her almost worm free just to pull her back into my grasp. Eventually I let her squirm free, her giggling like music to my ears as she calms down.\n\n\"Dad, c'mon! It's pancake time!\" She repeats, trying to pull the pillow out from under my head. I playfully stay rooted, another pair of hands pushing against my back as Fang betrays me. \n\n\"C'mon 'Dad', get going. I'm hungry too.\" Fang snickers, our daughter pulling against my arm with all her might. With a great exaggerated groan I rise up, wiping the crust from my eyes as the light of my life excitedly scrambles off the mattress. I grab my sweatpants from the floor and pull them on as she waits impatiently by the door, clutching her favorite stuffed orca as she bounces from foot to foot.\n\n\"Alright sweet-pea, I'm coming.\" I yawn, following her as she rushes toward the kitchen. We pass several framed photos in the hall, all showing treasured memories of the past few years. The reunion at Volcano High, the wedding, Fang smiling against the sunset, and finally the daughter we made together, swaddled in her mother's arms. \"Do you want to help me make them?\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" She beams, giving me the same enthusiastic answer as ever, \"With chocolate chips!\" Looking down at her, I know that everything was worth it, that everything is going to be alright. No matter what happens, I will never regret the path I took to get here.\n\n\"Well of course.\" I smile, all my worries long since forgotten as I watch her run, \"You can't have pancakes without chocolate chips.\"","encoded":false,"Title":"Early Morning Shenanigans","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Amber and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Ending

Damn Anon! Why did his house have to have that most disgusting of human characteristics, dandruff?\n\nAt first, it had been fun, playing in the dandruff with Reed. Anon wasn\u2019t there, instead asleep in his room. He hadn\u2019t necessarily invited them over, so-to-speak, but as the sky began disgorging its bounty of white, Trish and Reed decided they might as well spend some time playing while waiting for him to wake up. It was Reed\u2019s idea to masquerade as Dirty Dino first, and Trish couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to put him into place. She was damned if she was going to be Pinhead again! Unfortunately, their roughhousing had attracted the attention of Anon; who, still half-asleep, had stormed out of his room and beat the living shit out of the both of them, burying them in a shallow grave of white. So, Trish had decided to get the fuck out of there, and forget what Fang or Anon would think!\n\nPanting, the VVURM DRAMA duo finally manage to reach the entrance, the massive steel door Anon had fitted to protect himself from Skin Row crazies looming above them (well, above Trish). Shouldering her friend out of the way, Trish heaved at the peculiar wheel-shaped handle, her muscles straining as she twisted with all her might. \n\n\u201cUrgh\u2026Fuck!\u201d Gritting her teeth, Trish doubled-down on her attempts to open their way to freedom, Reed standing silently behind her. The handle was covered in some unfamiliar excretions, no doubt some disgusting skinny residue that Anon had failed to clean off. Suddenly, Trish\u2019s hands slipped, her momentum sending her fists smacking straight into Reed\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cOw!\u201d Reed exclaimed, a good second or two after Trish had made contact. Trish wasn\u2019t sure if he was just saying ow to spare her feelings (she knew she wasn\u2019t as strong as she looked), or if he was just too stoned to care.\n\n\u201cSorry Reed, but the door is locked!\u201d Trish pointed at the door handle, where a semi-transparent mucus had covered the lock completely. They were trapped!\n\n\u201cLet me have a try.\u201d Brows furrowing, Reed strolled with the upmost confidence past his diminutive friend, chest puffed out and shoulders squared. Pausing in front of the door, Reed spat dramatically on both his palms. Trish could feel a flutter of excitement in her chest: Reed was stronger than he looked, and with the amount of carfe current coursing through his powerful, thick veins, there was no way he could fail! Squaring up with the door, Reed throw his arms back, his sinuous biceps flexing as he prepared his own attempt at opening the door. This was going to work! This was-\n\n\u201cOpen sesame!\u201d Reed shouted, at the same time thrusting his hands forward dramatically. Trish stared, open-mouthed, her expression flying from rage to sadness and back to rage in the span of a microsecond. The door remained resolutely shut. Shrugging, Reed walked back to Trish, the purple Trigger\u2019s face incandescent with rage.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve done all I can do.\u201d ","encoded":false,"Title":"Escape From The

Fuck \u2018em all - fuckin\u2019 skinnies!\u201d The lamp swung over the table as the little purple triceratops swung her bottle of 33 around, gesturing across the bar. \u201cFuck are you looking at?\u201d - this to a bartender side-eyeing her. Anon sighed and put his hand over his hand over his face as she thrust herself out of her chair then fell sprawling onto her well-padded front and started to sob.\n\n\u201cGive me a hand with \u2018Goras, Reed?\u201d The two of them dragged the semi-conscious shortstack out the door and into the grimy lantern-lit street. While Reed sat on the gutter next to an incoherent Trish, Anon ducked back into the bar, spotting a familiar ptero crest. He circled around in front of her; back before the start of their tour he would have surprised her with a hug from behind, but these days she\u2019d probably stick her ka-bar through him.\n\nAs she spotted him those amber eyes lit up, and her brows raised in question. \u201c\u2018Goras and Reed are out the front,\u201d explained Anon, and Fang sighed and headed for the door. \u201cWhy do you call her \u2018Goras when she gets like this?\u201d she said. \u201cShort for Pythagoras,\u201d said Anon, \u201con account of all her triggernometry.\u201d Fang let out an involuntary burst of laughter, threw her hands in the air, and dug an elbow into his ribs as she walked past him and out into the alley. \u201cAt least I can get her some uppers in the morning,\u201d Reed muttered, stilling the shaking in his hands with a pull from a hip flask.\n\n~~~~\n\nLeave done, back on base, and one diminished and sunken-eyed trigga crew chief in tow, the four hurried towards their MedEvac Huey. Fang and Anon hoisted themselves into the cockpit while Reed and Trish swung up behind them into the cabin.\n\nFang began running through the preflight checklist as Anon reached out to switches and circuit breakers all over the cockpit. \u201cOverhead switches - circuit breakers - in! External lights - anti collision - on! Cargo reel, wipers, heating - off!\u201d The sound of dexedrine popping out of a blister strip came from the cabin, as Reed popped some government-issue amphetamines into his hand and passed them wordlessly to Trish. Anon started the MedEvac Huey\u2019s turbine as a nearby gunship\u2019s rotor began spinning, both engines screaming higher and louder. Fang\u2019s snoot brushed up against his cheek and lay there for a silent few seconds as he raised a free hand to lightly tap it, then she turned back to the checklist and began to speak.\n\n\u201cAlright, VVURM DRAMA!\u201d A pink fuzzy forearm thrust into the cockpit holding a wad of gauze, forefinger and thumb making a fingergun. \u201cRecapping that briefing! We\u2019re heading 180 klicks north out of Saigon to a gully; squad of marines have come under fire and taken casualties.\u201d The Hueys began rising together and pivoted north. \u201cThe dweebs over there in the Hanasaki are escorting us in and providing cover.\u201d\n\nMoving low and fast, the stick familiar under Anon\u2019s hands, his ship flew out of Saigon and out of the safe zone. Ahead and to the left behind an M60, a red-orange shape fidgeted, telling beads of a rosary too far away and too small to see. A green head sat barely visible in the cockpit.\n","encoded":false,"Title":"Fortunate Snoot","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Stella, Reed, Trish, Rosa and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Anonymous"},"Fortunate Snoot Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Fortunate Snoot Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Fortunate Snoot - part 2\n------------------------\n\n  The two helis crested a ridge and swung down low and fast over the jungle towards two billowing plumes of smoke. The UHF radio crackled: \u201ccontact on the tree line, one fifty feet north of the white smoke. Friendlies by the red. Repeat, contact north of white, friendlies by red.\u201d\n\n  Fang hit the transmit button. \u201cStella, strafe that treeline when we\u2019re in range, one fifty north of white smoke. Ground troops, get ready for dustoff.\u201d Then over the crew headsets, \u201cAnon, take us in on the red smoke. Reed, Trish, we\u2019re expecting two casualties hit by shrapnel, one more took multiple rounds to the stomach.\u201d \n\n  A brief pause; then rockets, 7.62mm rounds, and wholly inaudible Latin screeching whooshed, zipped, and reverberated towards a treeline that had been abandoned for at least five minutes. Anon guided his chopper down beside the wounded soldiers, face characteristically blank but hands white on the joystick. A lean and fuzzy pink body jumped the last ten feet with first aid kit in hand, then sprinted towards two curled up figures, while purple hands prepared a stretcher.\n\n  The next few minutes Reed and Trish were a blur of motion. A pallid and comatose archeopteryx with extensive stomach wounds was rapidly triaged and her wounds bandaged, then bundled into a stretcher; a caveman with nasty shrapnel wounds to his right side was dosed with morphine, the squad\u2019s medic having used all their issued supply, then slid onto their second stretcher; a weeping stego with gouges across her face and a fractured wrist was gently led to the cabin by Reed. Calm as only a part-time medic and full-time junkie with steady and regular access to Chinese carfentanyl could be, the ex-drummer dabbed Mercurachrome antiseptic onto the wounds of his patient and nodded as she wailed. \n  \u201cI hit the tripwire... I kicked it... he was right beside me and I kicked it\u201d.\n\n  Trish hopped back into the heli and grabbed her M16, eyes scanning the treeline as the stretchers were loaded.\n  Fang nudged Anon in the side. \u201cTake us up.\u201c\n  Rosa fired one last desultory M60 burst at the empty jungle as the gunship broke off, following Anon as he flew the medevac heli back to Tan Son Nhut.\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  Nurses and orderlies descended on the heli, lifting the stretchers out with professional ease. Reed wandered off after them. Trish, caught between the jitters of Dexedrine and a splitting headache, defaulted to her usual personality of \u201ccontrol freak\u201d and descended on a gaggle of mechanics like a tiny purple eagle attacking a litter of defenceless enlisted kittens. \n\n  Anon and Fang stepped through the postflight checklist, then strode off over the scorching airbase tarmac to the mess hall. Anon poured two cups of military-quality coffee, while Fang retrieved her guitar and began tuning it, plucking quietly at each string.\n  Anon looked over at her. \u201cDo you realise you stick your tongue out like a constipated snake when you play?\u201d\n  Fang flicked a guitar pick at him. He completely failed to catch it, and it bounced off his forehead onto the table, where she retrieved it with a smug glance.\n\n  Taking a long gulp and grimacing, Fang abandoned her coffee, and began to play. It was a nameless improvised tune in a major key, but she played it soft and slow, dragging out rests and borrowing chords from the minor. Anon rested his head on his arms as she poured her heart and soul out for just the two of them, tired notes cascading through the empty mess hall.","encoded":false},"Fortunate Snoot Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Fortunate Snoot Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"Fortunate Snoot - part 3\n------------------------\n\n  Fang, Anon, Trish, and Reed stood to attention, along with all the 57th Medical Detachment stationed at Tan Son Nhut and their escort gunship crews. Major Charles L Skelly addressed them. Bone-thin and gaunt, the caveman\u2019s return to lead the detachment was jokingly rumored to be as much voodoo as medical science.\n  \u201cThe following crews will step forward when named and gather their belongings when dismissed. Heli commanders, report for a briefing at 1000 hours; the rest of you, prepare for a flight to Soc Trang. VVURM DRAMA, Hanasaki. Walkup, Over Yonder. Doctordoctor, Foetal Position...\u201d He walked down the line naming pairs of names, five medevac and five gunship crews.\n\n  Dismissed, the lot of them headed off towards the barracks. Trish booted a rat away from her feet with a grimace. \n  \u201cHarsh, man\u201d said Reed, and yawned.\n  \u201cSomething keep you up?\u201d said Fang innocently.\n  \u201cNo idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n  \u201cSomething green and into tarot readings?\u201d\n  \u201cA true bro keeps one eye out for future brodowns\u201d intoned Reed, blushing slightly.\n  Fang cackled and swung open the barracks door.\n\n  Behind them, Anon eyed Trish as her emotional compass swung from shocked, to devastated, to aroused, back to shocked, and settled into an even sourer look than usual.\n  \u201cStop checking out Trish\u2019s fat ass and give me a hand with my kit, Anon\u201d snipped Fang.\n  \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n  Anon quickly packed Fang\u2019s uniforms into her duffel bag as she hauled them onto the double bed, then switched over to pulling out his own uniform as she packed. Across the barracks, Reed and Trish worked independently and a good deal slower on their single beds. Fang reverently strapped her guitar case closed, then lay on the bed for a moment with her eyes closed. \n  \u201cUUUGGGhhhhhhhhh, time for this briefing.\u201d She pushed off the bed and walked out the door.\n  Anon walked over to Reed and the two of them quickly finished stuffing his lightly creased uniforms away, an unobtrusive plastic-wrapped package nestled under layers of protective khaki fabric. One pink fist-bump, and Reed sauntered out the door in search of somewhere to take a nap.\n\n  Anon turned finally to Trish. She wordlessly handed him clothing and knickknacks and he packed it away. She yanked the zipper shut, and the two of them began carting duffel bags outside as she finally opened her mouth.\n  \u201cYou must think I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d\n  Anon, having long since learnt his lesson, stayed quiet.\n  \u201cAll these years and he still just walks out like that. If you or Fang were packing, he\u2019d be there in a flash.\u201d She looked down. \n  Anon risked an \u201cmmmm.\u201d\n  \u201cI\u2019m Trish, I\u2019m the hardass, I\u2019m the crew chief, I\u2019m the business manager, I\u2019m the one who sorts shit out. Trish never needs help.\u201d She chokes. \u201cTrish never hesitates. Trish never waits around for her year-long crush to make a move until he fucks the airbase weeb.\u201d\n\n  She threw her arms around Anon, who was diligently keeping his mouth shut with an expression of dawning horror. \u201cI let him go, Anon. The one thing in life I didn\u2019t fight for, didn\u2019t bloody my knuckles to get, the one time I trusted someone else and waited, and he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s gone.\u201d \n\n  She broke down sobbing and Anon gently maneuvered her down to sit on the edge of the bed, his arm around her. He hoverhanded for a second, until compelled to rub her shoulder by the mental image of Principal Spears roaring at him.\n  \u201c\u00a1No te puedo creer!\u201d shouted Rosa, walking past outside the barracks door. Trish looked up at the lime-green stego walking beside her, eyes full of hate.","encoded":false},"Fortunate Snoot Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Fortunate Snoot Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"Fortunate Snoot\n part 4 (rev1)\n---------------\n\n  Ten Hueys thundered through the clear blue sky in a rough V pattern, like a flock of belligerent turbine-powered geese. Half had red crosses, the others bristled with rocket pods and 7.62mm miniguns. A caveboy with no discernable face and a pterodactyl girl whose snoot protruded about a foot in front of her sat in a cockpit near the middle of the formation. A pink fluffy medic in aviators and a puffy-eyed purple triceratops sat behind them in the cabin. \n\n  Fang held a commercial radio up to her mic. It was switched to the North Vietnamese Army propaganda station Radio Hanoi, and three of the four were uncontrollably giggling at the broadcast.\n\n  \u201c-mislead by your leaders! They have sadly misinformed you of the true facts of why you are here! To be exploded, bayoneted, torn into pieces for a lie, do you want this? The moment you land here, American servicedinos, the clock is ticking for you; we do not want you here, and you will die here. American servicecavemen, do you think the same capitalist imperialist dinos who laugh at you and call you \u2018skinny\u2019, do you think they care about you? Your cause-\u201d\n\n  Reed\u2019s lazy drawl crackled over the headset, \u201cHey, they\u2019re not wrong, this capitalist is building a Raptor-Jesus-damned carfe empire out here.\u201d\n  Anon hit the mic. \u201cSomeone keeps colonising the dino nuggies from our MRE stash, wonder who that could be?\u201d\n  \u201cJust let your commanding officer worry about that, I\u2019ll keep a close eye on those\u201d Fang chimed in.\n  \u201cMore like a close snoot on them.\u201d\n  Fang laughed and moved the radio back in position.\n\n  \u201c-when you sit alone at night in your stifling barracks surrounded by a countryful of men and women who hate you and have the true revolutionary fervour to remove you, when the bullet pierces you, will it have been worth it? Your time is up, GI Joe. Tick, tock.\u201d\n  \u201cTick, tock,\u201d echoed Fang and Anon, in the manner of a devout churchgoer saying amen, then burst into laughter again.\n  \u201cMan, she never gets old,\u201d said Reed.\n\n  A recording of a truly awful Vietnamese soprano began playing, voice rising into an unearthly screech. Fang winced and switched over to the US-run Armed Forces Vietnam Network, which at least had decent taste in music. The UH-1 flew on through a warm blue sky over a brilliant green jungle.\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  As they arrived at Soc Trang, the fact it was a great deal more spartan than Tan Son Nhut really hit home. The larger air base in Saigon had a mess hall, air conditioning, and even a bar. Soc Trang had a bunch of ramshackle huts with sandbags along all the walls, some still with shrapnel lodged in them or sporting burn marks.\n\n  They stood to attention yet again and listened to yet another primer on what they were doing here. The group were now stationed much closer to the front. They would be able to support an increasingly strung out and scattered \u201cfrontline,\u201d insofar as the current clusterfuck of a war even had one. They were replacing a group who\u2019d been stationed there for a month straight. They were to give nothing less than 110%. They were to uphold the finest traditions of the airforce. They were representing their country. So on, and so on, and so on.\n\n  After a boring half an hour in the hot sun they were dismissed, and left to settle into their lodgings. Trish flopped her bag down and left to go establish dominance amongst her fellow crew chiefs and specialist technicians, Fang was dragged away to another briefing, and Reed and Anon were left alone.\n\n  \u201cHey man, got a couple of \u2018business contacts\u2019 to reach out to,\u201d said Reed. \u201cWant to come with?\u201d\n  \u201cWhat are you getting me into, Reed?\u201d muttered Anon, before saying \u201cno problem!\u201d in a much louder and clearer voice.\n  \u201cFirst one is a corporal assigned to perimeter guard duty here. We\u2019ll go say hi, see if he can get his hands on some dope or whatever. Slowly build up the relationship with a couple of minor deals.\u201d He passed a small rectangle to Anon.\n  \u201c...Reed Import\/Export business cards? Seriously? And in crayon?\u201d\n  \u201cYeah man, marketing is the cornerstone of commerce,\u201d explained Reed.\n  \u201cThe pink bicep holding an AK is a nice touch.\u201d\n  \u201cThank you, Anon!\u201d\n  \u201cSo\u2019s the yellow and black ancap flag.\u201d\n  \u201cI knew you\u2019d appreciate true art, bro.\u201d\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  Fang walked back from the briefing; a totally pointless one, since her crew wouldn\u2019t be flying until tomorrow. Coming up through the gap between two of the dilapidated barracks, she saw a silhouette push itself off the wall in front of her.\n\n  \u201cA big shot police commissioner\u2019s daughter, all the way out here?\u201d a white-scaled orange-crested Dilophosaurus sneered. \u201cWhat, daddy didn\u2019t buy your way out? Or did you actually volunteer to be here?\u201d\n  \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d asked Fang, feeling more confused than angry.\n  \u201cYou\u2019re Ripley Aaron\u2019s kid, right? Volcano High, shitty emo-rock band, rebellious species-mixing boyfriend?\u201d The Dilophosaurus grabbed her shoulder roughly. \u201cThat old asshole is the one in charge of rounding up draft dodgers for Caldera Bay. You\u2019re gonna find that neither he nor you are real popular here.\u201d He pushed past her roughly and rammed her into the side of the hut, face screwed up with disgust, then sauntered off.\n  Fang looked down at her muddy arm, the shock of the unexpected confrontation giving way to the pumping adrenaline of fight-or-flight. \u201cFuck you too, asshole!\u201d she screamed at his back, and picked up a dirty discarded bottle from the ground to hurl. It exploded into shards on a beam behind him.\n\n  Then more quietly as she leant against the wall and waited for the jitters to subside. \u201cDad?\u201d she whispered.\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  Trish clambered up onto Rosa\u2019s heli. She reached down to grab the socket wrench from Rosa.\n  \u201cThanks for offering to help swap out the rotor assembly, mi amiga. I\u2019m good at the heavy lifting, but these bolts\u2026 al diablo con esos.\u201d Rosa crossed herself after the minor blasphemy.\n  \u201cHey, a woman who promises me a tail-rotor driveshaft with two thousand flight hours left gets whatever she wants,\u201d Trish replied. Both dinos smiled the warm but predatory smile of two mothers providing for a pair of enormous metal babies.\n\n  They attached the first rotor blade to a hand crane, beginning the first hour of the many they\u2019d spend swapping out the rotor assembly.\n  Trish gossiped as she removed bolts. \u201cSooooo... I overheard some of the rotor specialists say that rustbucket Doctordoctor would be out for at least a week after they found a ding on her rotor yoke - inventory doesn\u2019t have a spare. Might be worth checking out, see if we can arrange some early Christmas presents from the rubes.\u201d\n  \u201cEsos tontos. They would give up their mothers for a six pack of beer. That\u2019s where your new driveshaft comes from.\u201d\n  Trish gasped. \u201cA six pack?\u201d She shook her head in derision. \u201cLike taking candy from a baby.\u201d\n\n  They worked on into the night. Trish sank herself into the gossiping, banter, and hard work. She could almost forget Rosa was on the same crew as Stella.\n","encoded":false},"Fortunate Snoot Chapter 5.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Fortunate Snoot Chapter 5.txt"],"text":"Fortunate Snoot\n part 5 (rev1)\n---------------\n\n  They'd been on base at Soc Trang for three days, mostly flying routine medical transport missions, and it was finally mail call day. The entire mess hall seethed with impatience.\n\n  Fang\u2019s tail tapped a nervous staccato rhythm against her seat. She alternated between talking to Stella, endlessly tuning her guitar, and scratching at her wings. Trish was practically vibrating as she tried to read a workshop manual, occasionally standing up and walking around aimlessly. Anon and Reed arm wrestled the marine assigned to be door gunner of Stella and Rosa\u2019s gunship, a bulky t-rex with ludicrously tiny forearms and biceps. Every single dino and human in the mess hall glanced at the door whenever it opened.\n\n  To understand the importance of mail call, you had to know just how little news from home troops could get while deployed. To make a radio call you had to either suck up to the operators of a very illegal pirate HAM radio station and beg for some precious minutes, or have the good luck to be stationed on a base with a legitimate MARS radio and the patience to queue for it. Telephones were practically non-existent outside civilian telegraph offices in the bigger cities. This made mail the sole reliable lifeline of communication with those back home, and mail call was the all-important handing out of those letters. The base was hours or maybe minutes away from receiving the only news they\u2019d get all month.\n\n  After 20 long minutes, Rosa burst in the door carrying a bulky sack of mail, followed by an officer. Every head in the mess turned to stare. \u201cAn-on! Help mi with las correspondencia.\u201d The two of them spread bundles of letters and parcels over the table, and the officer began calling names.\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  Back in the barracks with their mail, the gang sat down and began opening it.\n\n  Trish squealed. \u201cMom sent cookies!\u201d She rapidly tore into her package and put one in her mouth, chomping away happily. \u201cOa\u2019mea\u2019 n\u2019 raishin,\u201d she said with a full mouth.\n\n  In response to the idea of oatmeal and raisin, Fang mimed gagging, but without looking up from her letter. She finished reading through it, then said \u201cDad says he\u2019s got nobody to practice his golf swing with, now Anon\u2019s gone. Moe\u2019s hired Jerry again. Volcano High finally fixed the hole Spears kicked in that roof fence. Mr Ringo joined the navy. What did you get, Anon?\u201d\n\n  Anon groaned and held up the one letter he\u2019d received. It said \u201cOutstanding Unpaid Balance\u201d in big red letters, followed by a forest of fine print.\n\n  Reed was struggling with a large package. He finally ripped the tape off, revealing a box with \u201cPatented Walton Belt Vibrator\u201d written on it. The contraption advertised \u201cyears of pleasure and fitness.\u201d\n\n  Fang\u2019s eyes went wide, and she gasped \u201cNo fucking way, Reed! What is THAT?\u201d\n\n  Reed winked at her and shook the box. It clinked as glassware hit glassware. \u201cFitness is important.\u201d\n\n  \u201cOh, it\u2019s just another degenerate \u2018business shipment\u2019 of yours in a dumb box. Go ahead.\u201d\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  One of the peculiarities of dino military tradition was maintaining unisex barracks; another was allowing unmarried couples to share a bed outside estrus season. Anon and Fang lay in companionable silence, Anon reading a book on record cutting, Fang still going over her letters from home. \n\n  Moe, Samantha, golf, Jerry, school, Nasser had apparently enlisted as a surgeon\u2026 not a word about his work. Had that dilophosaurus been right about him? Even if he was catching draft during dodgers, was her dad in the wrong? She'd been drafted herself, after all. She'd called the war colonialist French meddling, but she'd still gone through flight school and officer training. She hadn't dodged anything.\n\n  \"Do you ever look around at base, and wonder how many of them really want to be here?\" she said suddenly. \n\n  Anon put his book down then turned to her with raised eyebrows. \n\n  Fang went on, \"You're the only enlisted man in our crew, and you're only here because your dad threatened to send you back to Brazil or disinherit you. Reed, Trish, me, we're all from the draft.\" \n\n  \"Never really thought about our crew in particular,\" said Anon, \"but you're right in general. Most people here hate the draft, even the ones who support the war.\"\n\n  Fang was silent for a while. \"Remember when you told me there were too many useless people in the world?\" \n  \"Hmmmm?\" \n  \"What if all those generals and senators and\u2026 and police commissioners, what if they think we're the useless people? What if this whole war is just thinning the herd to them?\"\n\n  \"You're not useless. We're not useless. When we get back home, your first album is going to go platinum, and I'm going to be the one who recorded it for you.\" Anon kissed her on the cheek.\n\n  She turned away for a moment, then sighed and snuggled down into the crook of his arm. She put her dad's letter aside and wrapped her arms around Anon.\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  It was past midnight when the siren went off. The crew jogged out onto the tarmac. They all knew the drill by now; Fang and Anon in the cockpit going through the preflight checklist, Reed in the back sorting through the medical supplies, Trish checking her and Reed\u2019s harnesses and loading a magazine into her rifle. She\u2019d chamber a round when they got close.\n\n  To the left, Stella, another pilot, Rosa, and the arm-wrestling t-rex from the mess got into their own heli.\n\n  Fang listened intently to the radio, then said \u201cTake us south-west, Anon. I\u2019ll have the exact coordinates soon. There\u2019s an M113 personnel carrier that\u2019s rolled over on the road out of C\u00e0 Mau. A mechanised infantry platoon are out there trying to right it, and they've come under fire from Vietcong in a night raid and taken casualties.\u201d\n\n  The heli flew south into the night. Soon, they could see tracers and fire in the distance. Two jets roared past them towards the fight, then roared back in the other direction minutes later.\n\n  \"Gonna be a hot landing zone, ladies and gentlemen and enbies and attack helicopters,\" said Fang over UHF radio and their headsets.\n\n  \"Thank you for giving attack helicopters the recognition they deserve,\" replied Stella primly, but her heart wasn't in it.\n\n  They all knew what a hot LZ meant. They'd be taking constant fire, potentially from more than one side, while trying to extract wounded troops.

Semi-NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Haremanon\n\n\nSnoot Game - how Fang's mom figured it out\n\n>Summer 2040, Volcadera Bluff\n>It was a hot day, perfect for dinos and bearable for humans.\n>Perfect for a family meeting in the Volcadera Park, grills included.\n\n>\"I've always wondered about Trish, dear.\"\n>Fang froze.\n>\"Rea, I understood. If the biological father of her child didn't want to be part of her family, then it was his problem, not hers. Why, you even helped her move into your house. I'm still proud of you for that.\"\n>\"T-thanks, mom\", she whispered barely audible.\n>\"But Trish!\" Her mom clicked her tongue. \"I didn't understand her. She was not the sort to accept something like that, not with you, not with anyone she cherishes, especially not her own children.\"\n>\"Why, it was almost as if this man never existed to her. Very strange.\"\n>Suddenly, Lucy wanted to be at the other side of the field, where Anon, Dad, and Uncle Rex were bunched around a giant grill. She so did not want to have this conversation now.\n>\"I'm sorry, dear. I might overstep my boundaries\", she continued. \"But... for the sake of clarity. I must ask you this. I ask for forgiveness in advance. But please answer me honestly.\"\n>\"Did Anon force this onto you?\"\n>So, this was it. Nearly twenty years of marital up and downs, challenges and joys of parenthood, lies and deception, and now it was all coming to the surface. It was almost freeing, in a way.\n>For a terrible moment Fang considered to continue lying, considered spinning a yarn, but she loved her mother too much for this. Almost as much as she loved her own children and Anon, blood and water.\n>\"No. He did not cheat on me, mom.\"\n>It clearly wasn't enough, as Mom's raised eyebrow expressed.\n>\"It... God, it started around the time Anon came back.\"\n>\"I remember. You were in such a tizzy, back then, especially when he asked for your hand in marriage.\"\n>\"Yeah. But, err, we... we actually met again a bit sooner. When we were still in university.\"\n>\"Oh?\"\n>\"I don't remember who started it. Not Anon, I know that for sure. He'd never cheat on me. You know that, mom.\"\n>\"Ah, I do. It was yet another strange clue, one that didn't quite fit the situation at hand.\"\n>Fang's wing flickered nervously.\n>\"It was weird, yeah. I cared about Trish and Rea lots back then, already. There were moments that, umm... We were closer than before.\"\n>Mom looked not quite scandalized.\n>\"We didn't do anything like that.\" She hesitated. \u201cYet.\u201d\n>\"But I guess there was a reason why a lot of girls hit on us during the final years.\"\n>\"And then Anon came back, and things got, err, off the rails.\"\n>\"Rea and him were always close, but she wouldn't have done anything with him unless I were ok with it, and Trish was...\"\n>\"Rather deep in denial over her attraction to humans, still?\"\n>Well, err, yes, but no. She just...\"\n>Fang tried to find the right words.\n>\"They didn't piss her off at all?\"\n>\"Anon was pretty much the only one to get a rise out of her like that.\"\n>\"And we did live in a community, so they had to hear us...\", Fang trailed off.\n>\"Oh, these poor girls\", her mom finished dryly.\n>Much to Fang's relief, in that moment a new arrival interrupted their talk, with Trish running over and tackling her firstborn son.\n>The tall triceraptos weathered her without trouble and embraced her with laughter as his father and family-members approached to greet him.\n>Fang took the opening.\n>\"Well, I have to go now! Wouldn't do of me not to greet my nephew and all that!\"\n>\"Sit.\"\n>She obeyed. When Mom had that tone, there was no arguing.\n>\u201dSo, Anon didn\u2019t initiate this. Was it Trish?\u201d\n>\u201dRea, actually\u201d, she replied. \u201cWent and asked me if she could sleep with Anon, just this once.\u201d\n>\u201d\u2026 well, at least she tried to be honest about it.\u201d\n>\u201dI did want to say no at first.\u201d As she continued, she got more and more emotional, her feathers spreading out wide.\n>\u201dBut\u2026 I was happy somehow. If she had just gone ahead and tried, I wouldn\u2019t have forgiven her, but she asked and\u2026 I understand if you don\u2019t agree with me, but back then she was so scared. That I\u2026 That I would yell at her and throw her out for even thinking about it. She was one of my best friends already. I\u2019d never done that to her. Not when\u2026\u201d \n>\u201dAnd you agreed?\u201d Fang simply nodded, her feathers slowly settling down again.\n>\u201dIt was hard convincing him. I used to think he was an exception, but\u2026 men do stay loyal to their mates, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n>\u201dDarling, these people you thought of are the loud exception. Trust me in this. You have nothing to worry about with your husband.\u201d\n>\u201dRight. It was supposed to be a one-time thing. Was. But, err, we didn\u2019t really stop.\u201d\n>\u201dI can tell.\u201d","encoded":false,"Title":"How Fang's Mom Figured it Out.","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Samantha, Ripley, Reeda, Trish,

I'll show him. I don't need his stupid monkey cock. What I need now is strong dino dick. Fellow Dinos are more faithful than those stupid barbaric fire starters, and probably more hung too. \n\nI reach for my phone, claws making clicking noises against its screen as I furiously text my best friend Trish. She's resourceful, she can cook me up. My fucking shitty knuckle dragger \"boyfriend\" is going to be so jealous.\n\nA couple of hour laters, after my dumb retarded family finally leaves, there's a knock on my door. I practically rip the door off its hinges as I open it, inviting three extremely handsome triceratops inside. Wasting little time, I rip off my pants, exposing my gender neutral slit to them as I bend myself over my awful dad's chair. \n\nThe strapping, handsome, and better than human dinos waste little time either, removing their own clothing as well. One straddles me from the back, while the other two motion for me to jerk off their dicks, which I gladly do.\n\nWhile giving the two giant slabs of dino-dick the respect they deserve, the one grinding me from behind finally penetrates my enbie hole, causing me to scream out a moan as my tongue hangs out of my mouth. My insides are perfectly filled with triceratops penis, which my STUPID UNFAITHFUL SKINNIE BOYFRIEND could never hope to achieve.\n\nWe all basically cum at the same time being equals, and I bask in the afterglow. There's another knock on the door, and I don't even bother cleaning myself up or putting pants on to answer it. My parents will see just how strong and independent I am.\n\nI'm surprised however, to see that it's my bestie, leading my NO GOOD BOYFRIEND behind on a leash--\n\n\"Heeey. You've been pounding away at your laptop for a while now. You know lunch is almost over, right?\"\n\nReed's voice calls out to me, and I slam my laptop closed in a panic. He raises a questioning brow at me.\n\n\"Whatcha doing anyway? I don't remember any assignments from class.\"\n\nShit. He can't know. Quickly Trish, think of something. You're smart and cool, you can do it.\n\n\"Uh...Venue stuff.\" Nailed it. I mentally fist pump at my flawless lie, and Reed just shrugs and returns to drinking from his thermos.\n\nThank god.

His clothes were rumbled, hastily grabbed from an unpacked box; a box that contained nothing of Lucy\u2019s. None of them had, their contents flung out in a desperate search for something, anything, that proved Lucy had moved into that apartment with Anon. Even her side of the bed was cold, the sheets undisturbed. Pulling his coat tighter against the fall air, Anon shivered involuntarily, a shiver that had nothing to do with the temperature.\nFrantically, Anon ran through the events as he knew them. Lucy hadn\u2019t been there when he woke up, no trace of her to be found in their apartment. Ripley didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, claimed to not have spoken to Lucy in years. Could this be some sort of elaborate prank, some means of getting back at him for hiding a jack-in-the-box in one of the boxes Lucy was packing the day before?\n\u201cNo, this is too cruel, even for her\u2026\u201d Anon shook his head, not noticing the stares that followed in the wake of his muttering. The apartment Lucy and he shared was in an older but still well-traveled part of town, a place where two young lovers could afford to start their lives together. A passing mother pulled her young daughter closer to her as Anon brushed past, unseeing, uncaring of anything or anyone that wasn\u2019t Lucy. Anon could feel himself spiraling out of control now, feel his world slipping away. He needed some advice, someone to set his mind straight, and he knew just where to find it. \nTish\u2019s apartment wasn\u2019t too far away from the small one-bedroom he and Lucy shared. Truth be told, it was Trish who had found the place for them, her and Rosa proving to be a huge help in getting their life started. Trish was Lucy\u2019s friend, her best friend. Lucy had probably just\u2026stopped by, on her way to get some breakfast, just like she said they would do. Grimacing, Anon remembered the plans he and Lucy had made as they laid in one another\u2019s arms last night, plans that seemed to be vanishing like midmorning fog.\nThe building that Trish lived in was an old brick building, on a block that was a historically Triceratops neighborhood. Anon had nearly cried when he read her name on the list of tenants, reaching out to it like a drowning man would reach for a life preserved. Thumbing the button, Anon waited: The buzzer for Trish\u2019s apartment pierced the stillness of the morning, the shrill bell echoing loudly in the small stoop that served as entrance to her building. \n\u201cCome on, pick up Trish\u2026\u201d Even Anon could hear the panic on his voice.\n\u201c\u2026Hello?\u201d The voice on the other line was groggy, dripping with annoyance. Trish was never a morning person.\nAnon pressed himself as close as he could to the small intercom, struggling to keep his voice steady. \u201cTrish, thank Raptor Jesus you\u2019re up! This is Anon, is Lucy with you, I can\u2019t find her anywhere!\u201d She had to know where Lucy was, she had to!\n\u201cWait, Anon? Like from high-school, that Anon?\u201d Hot malice radiated from Trish\u2019s voice, muffled only slightly by the dodgy intercom. \u201cThe Anon that broke Fang\u2019s fucking heart all those years back?! How fucking DARE you come asking about her now! You fucking skinny piece of SHIT, do you know what you did to her?! FUCK. YOU.\u201d \n\u201cTrish, wait, please! I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but if I did anything to Lucy, please I can fix it, just tell me where she is!\u201d\nAnon could almost picture Trish on the other side of the intercom, a familiar look of hatred and rage blossoming across her face. Thinking back to those high-school days, Trish had looked at Anon like that a lot.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking unbelievable, you know that Anon?! You waited this fucking long to try and apologize, like it MATTERS now?! And what\u2019s with this \u201cLucy\u201d shit, anyways?!\u201d Trish\u2019s disgust for that name is evident even through the tinny reception of the ancient intercom. \u201cFANG is happy now, playing HER music, and you can just go fuck off back to your cave, you little spear-chucking piece of SHIT!\u201d A loud thump punctuates Trish\u2019s final words, as if she had struck the intercom with her fist before ending the call. \nAnon could only stand there, staring blankly at Trish\u2019s name on the list. Nothing she said made any sense! She talked like Anon had hurt Lucy in the past, back in high-school, but Anon had no idea what she was talking about, they had loved each other in high-school. And what was that about, about \u201cFang\u201d, like it was her real name, or something? Lucy used to go by that, sure, but she hadn\u2019t used that name in years. The only thing that Trish had said that made any sense, was that Lucy was playing music; but what did she mean by \u201cher\u201d music? What was that trigga talking about?!\nMovement from across the street caught Anon\u2019s eye as he turned away from the intercom, two hulking Triceratops moving towards him, scowls on their face. Gulping, Anon chastised himself for not watching his mumbling, especially here. Turning his back on the two probably wasn\u2019t a good idea, but Anon had to get out of there, fast, and no one could sprint backwards. \n\n\u201cAt least I\u2019ve got a lead now,\u201d Anon said as he took off running, the two men calling out after him. ","encoded":false},"What If Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Multiple","What If Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Chapter 2\r\n\r\nRemembering what Trish had said about Lucy playing her music, Anon spent the rest of the morning scouring every slightly dodgy record store, every second-hand guitar seller; any place where the old Lucy would\u2019ve been drawn to. It was the early afternoon by the time Anon paused in a familiar park, his heart sinking. The park had changed in the five years since he was gone: The playground had gotten replaced, and a few semi-permanent vendors were lining the paths and walkways, attempting to secure some weekend sales. The morning mist had burned off, leaving in its wake a bright and crisp Fall day. Families were out taking walks through the park, letting their children play in the piles of fallen leaves ahead of them. Every sight of a happy couple made Anon cringe a little more; there had been no sign of Lucy in any of the stores he visited, and no one there had seen anyone matching her description. \r\nSighing, Anon sat back on one of the park benches, scrubbing his hands across his face. He had since stopped wishing to wake up, pleading that this was just a bad dream, that he would blink his eyes and find himself back in bed, Lucy snoring gently next to him. Running from this situation wasn\u2019t going to get him anywhere; if he was going to find Lucy, he couldn\u2019t stop looking for her here, wallowing in self-pity! With one final scrub to wipe away the initial building of tears, Anon got to his feet, already looking up more music stores on his phone. \r\nA loud gurgling from his stomach reminded him that he hadn\u2019t eaten anything all day. He had been to consumed in his search to stop for food, but now that he had given himself a momentary respite, his body was paying him back in spades. Scowling, Anon tracked his eyes across the park, looking for a food vendor, any vendor, where he could get a quick bite before setting off again. A somewhat run-down cart sat on the edge of the path a few feet away, a faded red and yellow umbrella tilted against the afternoon sun shielding the purveyor from Anon\u2019s view. That one would do nicely, Anon decided, speed-walking over to it. A quick bite to eat, something he could take while he walked, and then it was back to his search. \r\nStepping around the umbrella, Anon\u2019s mind went blank, all thoughts of food escaping his mind. Like some sort of memory given life, the cart\u2019s vendor was the same orange woman with the ridiculous hat whom he had talked to before heading to Lucy\u2019s house, all those years ago! Age hadn\u2019t done any favors to the woman or her cart; the painted sign on the side of the cart had faded, been re-painted, and then faded again, the cartoon hot-dog barely legible on the side. The woman herself bore a few more wrinkles, and her overly large chef\u2019s hat sported a few more stains on it than Anon remembered. Her eyes were as quick as ever though, flashing quickly in the sun as she weighed Anon up as a potentially customer.\r\n\u201cHi there! Looking for some grub? We\u2019ve got chili dogs today, and I don\u2019t mind saying that you could use one, son!\u201d The woman was already dipping a ladle into a tureen on the back of the cart, steam roiling as she opened the metal lid. \u201cYou must really be hungry, friend, that mouth\u2019s hanging open so far I could practically drive my cart through it!\u201d Anon forced his mouth closed, mind racing. It was tenuous at best, but any link to his past might be the secret to finding out where Lucy had gone. Plus, that chili did look good.\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll take one. Listen, you may not remember me, but I used to live here, a few years back. You helped me once, gave me some advice about a \u2013\u201c\r\n\u201cAbout a girl, right? Yeah, we don\u2019t get a lot of humans here, outside of Skin Row, so I remember you. You were dating that Ptero girl, right?\u201d The vendor continued prepping the chili dog, smiling at Anon\u2019s curt nod. \u201cShame about what happened between the two of you. It\u2019s a small town, and word spreads pretty quickly, especially when you\u2019re friends with Moe.\u201d The vendor paused, ladle hovering over the surface of a glistening hot-dog. \u201cMoe didn\u2019t catch up with you, did he? He was pretty mad about what happened, what\u2026what you said to her.\u201d\r\nAnon grit his teeth, the vendor\u2019s question stabbing into his heart like a knife. \u201cA-actually, we, uh, worked things out. Have you seen her lately? We were supposed to meet up, but she hasn\u2019t answered her phone.\u201d He knew the lied was weak, and moved to disguise it, holding up his phone in an attempt to defend his tale. The vendor\u2019s eyes narrowed as she spooned the chili along the length of the hot-dog.\r\n\u201cBoy, I\u2019ve seen better lies from drunks so plastered they couldn\u2019t tell I was serving \u2018em the mustard bottle. What\u2019s really going on?\u201d The orange woman leaned her palms on the cart, and despite her diminutive frame seemed to loom over Anon, her eyes narrowing. \r\nAnon knew it was no use continuing to lie, but the thought of telling the truth, that his life with Lucy had just\u2026 vanished, sent chills down his spine. \u201cLook, have you seen her lately? I really need to find out where she went. It\u2019s important\u2026\u201d Anon could feel the tears welling up once more. \r\nThe vendor studied his face for a moment, eyes scanning his face for any semblance of falsehood. Something passed across her face, some sort of\u2026understanding of the situation. Sighing, the woman stood back, wrapping the chili dog up before handing it over. \r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where she is now, but I\u2019ve seen her at DeVito\u2019s, the pub down past Skin Row? Saw her there a few nights ago, when I was trying to work the night crowd.\u201d The vendor\u2019s hand shot out, snagging Anon\u2019s jacket as he spun to leave. \u201cHey, listen! That neighborhood is real bad, kid, so be careful. You could get hurt there \u2013 hey! What about my money?!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnon couldn\u2019t care about the minor theft he had just committed. He had found where Lucy could be, and he didn\u2019t dare waste another second without her.\r\n","encoded":false},"What If Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Multiple","What If Chapter

If Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Multiple","What If Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"Chapter 4\r\n\r\nIt was at least an hour before Anon could peel himself off the floor, the smell of what he had done finally becoming too much for even his numbed senses. A roll of paper towels and some cleaning spray from the move took care of the mess on the floor, Anon moping up his sick with stiff, robotic movements. He felt worse than numb; he felt dead, like a part of him had been murdered back at the pub. Lucy\u2019s words ran over and over in his head, a echoing symphony of \u201cpiece of shit\u201d and \u201cwho means NOTHING to me\u201d playing on repeat in his head, punctuated with images of her hand lashing out at him. Again and again and again\u2026\r\nAnon snapped out of his trace, shaking his head a little, realizing he had been scrubbing the same patch of hardwood for minutes now. Back in the kitchen, the soiled paper towels discarded, Anon stood staring at the wall, searching his thoughts for what to do. Something had happened to Lucy, something awful, and she seemed to have forgotten him. Truthfully, she seemed like an entirely different Lucy, so different from the one with whom he had rekindled their relationship a month ago. Could there be anything Anon could do to rekindle that love, to reignite the spark of \u201cthem\u201d in her? Anon\u2019s face still stung from the slap she had given him earlier. Was there anything of the Lucy he knew in that woman?\r\n\u201cNo. Wherever she is, Lucy is Lucy, and I love her,\u201d Anon said to himself, out loud. \u201cNo matter what it takes, I\u2019m going to win her back.\u201d His stomach growled in agreement, reminding Anon that he hadn\u2019t kept anything down that day. Smiling, Anon moved to the bathroom to clean himself up, remembering that there was a convenience store half a block down. \u201cFood first, win her back later,\u201d He said, catching his reflection in the mirror before nodding. Nothing was going to keep him from the woman he loved, not even the woman herself.\r\nA freshly-cleaned Anon stepped out of his apartment building, his new shirt free of any vomit-stains. Despite everything that had occurred, Anon felt\u2026 confident. Maybe it was his little pep-talk he gave himself in the kitchen beforehand, or maybe it was the semblance of a plan that was forming in his head, but Anon no longer felt lost, betrayed by what had occurred. Whomever Lucy was now, whatever had happened, Anon would set it right. The streets were quiet this time of night, only a handful of others walking home in the cold autumn night, but Anon met each gaze with a smile and a nod, hoping that any confidence he projected outward would help sustain the confidence he felt within himself. \r\nIt took only a few minutes to reach the convenience store, a small Din-o-Mart situated on the corner of the block. The large neon sign displayed a smiling cartoon dinosaur eating snack by the handful, illuminating the huddled figure of a pan-handler crouched near the door of the mart. He and Lucy had grabbed some dino-nuggies here the night before, eating them out of the bag, laughing at the mess. Anon smiled at the memory as he walked to the door, trying not to make eye contact with the dirty pink raptor sitting next to an overladen shopping cart.\r\n\u201cLike, spare some change, dude?\u201d A voice from the past riveted Anon to the spot. It couldn\u2019t be, could it? He always claimed to be the richest raptor in the world\u2026 Turning his head to face the man, Anon\u2019s eyes widened in shock. Crouched low on his heels was Reed, filthy hand held out expectantly, bloodshot eyes gazing up at Anon.\r\n\u201cReed? Shit, man, is that you?\u201d Anon crouched next to the man, his nose wrinkling. \u201cWhat happened, man? Lucy and I just saw you the other day, you said you had a gig lined up!\u201d Reed\u2019s glassy eyes stared back at Anon as the question hung in the air, his obviously fried brain attempting to put the signals together. \r\n\u201cDude, is that Anon? Broooo, I haven\u2019t seen you since high-school! Gimme a hug, my man!\u201d Despite his drugged-out stupor (or perhaps because of it), Reed\u2019s old personality shone through as he and Anon stood up, embracing one another. \u201cMan, it\u2019s been, like, what, five years bro? How you been?!\u201d Reed\u2019s smile was infectious, and despite all that happened Anon found himself happy to have meet a familiar face, albeit in a strange location.\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Reed. Lucy\u2019s\u2026 We had some\u2026 Look, when was the last time you\u2019ve seen Lucy?\u201d Anon unconsciously wiped his hands on his jacket, attempting to clean the filth from Reed\u2019s back off of them. Something from Trish\u2019s diatribe earlier today tickled Anon\u2019s mind as he smiled at Reed. Trish had described Lucy as someone totally different, and he chalked it up to just another trig-out, but if Reed could confirm his suspicions\u2026 \u201cShe\u2019s not been herself lately and I just wanted to know if you\u2019ve talked to her.\u201d\r\n\u201cLucy\u2026 Lucy\u2026\u201d Anon waited patient for Reed\u2019s drug-addled brain to make the connection, hoping he wouldn\u2019t have to prompt him too much during the conversation. \u201cOh, you mean Fang! Man I haven\u2019t seen her in a looooong time, bro. Ever since she, like, killed the band, we kinda went separate ways. Me, I\u2019ve been investing in some various ventures, doing a little \u201chedge-fund\u201d management, if you catch my drift\u2026\u201d Reed winked one bloodshot eye, the pupils of his other one intermittently dilating and expanding seemingly at random. Anon wondered what he was on now, if it was safe. \u201cAnyways, bro, real shame what happened between you and Fang. I heard about it from, like, Trish, right? Suuuper hard, bro, what you said to them. You gotta\u2019 put others first, sometimes, ya\u2019 dig?\u201d Reed attempted to clap Anon on the shoulder, missing by a few inches to the left and stumbling slightly. \r\n\u201cLook, Reed, I don\u2019t know what Trish told you in the past, but Lu\u2026 Fang and I are cool now, okay? In fact, I was hoping you could help me out, I want to surprise her at work tomorrow night, but I can\u2019t remember where she plays, do you know?\u201d Anon hoped his voice didn\u2019t sound too desperate. It was a long shot, asking someone in Reed\u2019s condition for help, but Reed often saw things others didn\u2019t see. Anon smiled again, thinking of all the times Reed had helped him out in his relationship with Fang. No, damnit, she was Lucy. Lucy!\r\n\u201cNah, not Lucy, man, Fang. Like I said, I haven\u2019t seen them in a while, but, like, I know I\u2019ve heard their song a few times at this pizza place down the street, Clawfino\u2019s? Ya\u2019 know, that one and you and they wrote in high-school? That song\u2019s like, super deep man\u2026\u201d Reed wavered slightly, as if all of the sudden his legs were straining to support his weight. \u201cHey, bro, do you think you could, catch me? It hella\u2019 hurts when I fall, dude.\u201d\r\n\u201cWah\u2026 Reed, you okay man? Reed!\u201d Reed had become even more unstable, swaying back and forth like a drunk attempting to walk the line, before collapsing heavily to the side. Anon barely managed to catch Reed in time, slowing his descent enough that Anon didn\u2019t think Reed\u2019s head was too injured by the concrete. Raising one eyelid and then another, Anon could see Reed\u2019s pupils were almost entirely gone, just a small pinprick of black showing in his purple eyes. A small amount of foam had startled to collect in the corner of Reed\u2019s mouth.\r\n\u201cShit, Reed, can you hear me?! REED! Fuck, call an ambulance, quick!\u201d The manager of the Din-o-Mart had come to see what the commotion was, no doubt ready to banish the homeless vagrant from her store\u2019s entrance. At Anon\u2019s instance the woman began dialing 9-1-1, the begrudging look in her eyes telling that she didn\u2019t really care what happened to Reed, so long as he didn\u2019t die outside her store. \r\nAnon continued to cradle Reed in his arms, feeling his friend\u2019s body begin to spasm slightly. Calling out his name once more, Anon could hear the wail of the siren approaching, thankful that the hospital wasn\u2019t too far away. \r\n\u201cReed, they\u2019re almost here bro, hang in there! Reed? REED!\u201d Reed had gone suddenly limp, the spasms halting almost as soon as they had begun. It didn\u2019t seem like Reed was breathing anymore. \u201cDamnit, Reed, NO! I\u2019m not going to lose you too, bro, hang in there, please!\u201d As Anon attempted to shake his longtime friend back into consciousness, he could feel just how emaciated Reed was beneath those baggy rags, could feel the scabs that festooned Reed\u2019s hands and arms as he held him close, tears welling up once more. \r\nThe ambulance had pulled up to the curb, the EMT\u2019s quickly prying Reed out of Anon\u2019s arms, attempting to resuscitate him on the sidewalk. They said they had to get Reed to the hospital, and fast, and before they could protest Anon had jumped into the ambulance with them. \r\n\r\nHe had already almost lost someone he cared about today. Reed wasn\u2019t going to be the second.\r\n","encoded":false},"What If Chapter 5.txt":{"path":["Multiple","What If Chapter

After washing his face, he managed to snag a few minutes away from work, enough to drive Anon back to the neighborhood near Clawfino\u2019s, making sure Anon promised to keep in touch before speeding off in the NasCar 2.0, a slick black mid-engine sports car. Checking his watch, Anon figured he still had a few hours until Lucy\u2019s show would end, having decided that making a scene during her set wasn\u2019t the best idea. Still, plenty of time to finally get some food in his stomach.\r\nAs Anon toured around the neighborhood near Lucy\u2019s venue, finishing the last few bites of the sandwich he picked up from a market some blocks away, he wondered what he would say to Lucy. Sure, he and Naser had hashed out what in general to say, as well as what to avoid, but it was the specifics that weighed on Anon\u2019s mind. Would Lucy even give him the time to say his piece, or would she react like she did earlier today at DeVito\u2019s? Anon needed something to break the ice with her, some sort of peace offering, but what? Dusting the last bit of crumbs from his lapels, Anon spied a flower store further down the block. Flowers had never been Lucy\u2019s coup of tea, but people seemed to do this sort of thing in the movies all the time. At any rate, it would give Lucy something to make fun of, besides himself. \r\nNearing the small store, Anon could see through the window that they were getting ready to close, the two women running the shop cleaning up their emptied-out display shelves. Glancing around, Anon found the name of the store: \u201cRosa\u2019s Rosas\u201d. She probably thought that was funny, even. Smiling, Anon pushed open the front door, not quite sure what to expect.\r\n\u201cExcuse me, se\u00f1or, but we are closing now. If you would like to come\u2026back\u2026tomorrow\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s words trailed off as she turned to greet her newest customer. Contrary to Reed, the years had treated Rosa well, her femininity only getting more refined with age. A long white apron covered her floral-print dress, not unlike the one she had often worn in high-school, and a matching white bandana kept her long curls away from her face. Her eyes held the same kindness that Anon remembered, although they were currently wide with shock.\r\n\u201cHey, Rosa, it\u2019s uh, been a while.\u201d Anon\u2019s attempt at small talk fell upon deaf ears as Rosa continued to stare at him, her mouth silently working. \u201cI was hoping you could, um, help me with something? Rosa? Hello?\u201d The moment stretched on, Rosa still unable to do anything but gape at him like a fish. Finally, just as Anon was getting ready to say his awkward goodbyes, Rosa erupted, shouting as she fled into the store\u2019s back room.\r\n\u201cSTELLA! VEN R\u00c1PIDO! IT\u2019S AN-ON!\u201d Muffled conversation spilled from the back room behind the store\u2019s counter, an unintelligible stream of Spanish totally beyond Anon\u2019s little vocabulary. Shortly thereafter, Rosa returned, dragging behind her longtime partner in crime. The stego girl was much as Anon remembered, sporting a cringey anime top over ragged jeans, her white apron of mess of plant stains. Mostly is was her hair that changed: Gone were the twin buns that Stella sported in high-school, replaced by an elaborate plait pulled over one shoulder. Like Rosa, her blue eyes stared widely at Anon, herself unable to do more than gawk as Rosa ran over to wrap Anon in a big hug.\r\n\u201cHey Rosa, it\u2019s good to see you t- OW!\u201d Rosa had broken the hug quickly, moving instead to smack Anon upside the head, her eyes flashing.\r\n\u201c\u00a1Pendejo! Do you know what you did, An-on! You broke that poor girl\u2019s heart! And you come back now?\u201d Rosa punctuated each sentence with another smack, her arms having lost none of their strength as Anon held his hands up to protect himself. Finally, she pulled Anon into another hug, whispering under her breath. \u201cDios lo perdone\u2026\u201d Anon let the events play out as they were, unable to bring himself to speak in his defense. Whatever he had done in this life, it seemed everyone knew about it. \r\n\u201cLet him go Rosa, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s been through a lot to come back here.\u201d Stella had moved closer in the meantime, wrapping Anon in a hug of her own as Rosa stepped back, wiping an errant tear from one eye. \u201cAnon, I\u2019m so sorry for what happened between you and Fang. I guess my readings back then weren\u2019t very accurate\u2026\u201d A brief flash of sadness darkened Stella\u2019s features as she took a step back, her comments about her tarot readings prompting Rosa to fish her familiar rosary beads out from her pocket. \u201cStill, you must\u2019ve done something these past years! Oh, did you watch this new anime series that came out? It\u2019s called Space-\u201c\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think An-on came by to talk about that, Stella dear. Come, Anon, sentarse. You must tell us everything!\u201d Rosa pulled Anon gently by the arm towards the counter where two tall stools sat on either side, her and Stella taking their seats with practiced ease. Anon lowered himself gingerly onto the hard stool. This wasn\u2019t at all what he expected when he considered seeing Rosa and Stella again. He figured out from Naser that the news of the other Anon\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s breakup was well known throughout the school by the end, but from Naser\u2019s hurried explanation as he sped through traffic, it seemed that whatever this other Anon had done, it was truly awful. Rosa and Stella weren\u2019t close with Lucy by any means, but for them to be so understanding\u2026\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I can explain, really, except I\u2019ve come back for Lucy, to apologize for anything I said to her, maybe even everything I said\u2026\u201d Fidgeting with a stray leaf still resting on the counter, Anon\u2019s eyes fell from the gaze of the two women. He hadn\u2019t even done whatever the other Anon had done, and he still felt guilty about it! \u201cBut that\u2019s all in the past now. I want to make it up to her, I want her to be happy again, and I think I can do that.\u201d\r\n\u201cAhh, el amor encuentra un camino\u2026\u201d Rosa blew her nose heavily on a handkerchief pulled from her pocket, and at the same time Stella\u2019s face lit up. \r\n\u201cAh, I knew this was going to happen! A few days ago, I did another reading, and it was\u2026weird, somehow. I dunno, but the cards were all mixed up. It was like I was doing a reading for someone who wasn\u2019t even there!\u201d Stella\u2019s hands slowly crept up, her elbows held tightly to her sides, assuming the same position she had always adopted whenever she was excited. \u201cRosa doesn\u2019t want to believe in what I see, but it must be true!\u201d\r\n\u201cAhh, I do not want to believe it because it is black magic, Stella! An-on must follow his heart, not some cartas paganas!\u201d Stella deflated somewhat at Rosa\u2019s chastisement, but her face still held that familiar beaming look in it. Reaching across the counter, Rosa took Anon\u2019s hand, squeezing it hard around the rosary. \u201cYou have to go to her, An-on. Go to Fang and tell her how you feel!\u201d\r\nSmiling, Anon squeezed back briefly, glancing between the two old friends. \u201cThat\u2019s actually why I was here. I thought, maybe, if I brought some flowers, or something, she might\u2026 I mean, I know Lucy was never one for flowers, but\u2026\u201d Anon\u2019s words trailed off as Rosa and Stella beamed at him. \u201cWhat? What did I say?\u201d \r\nWordlessly, Rosa turned to the workbench behind her, where assorted flowers and cuttings littered the steel work surface. Carefully, she selected one long-stemmed flower, the red blossom looking somewhat familiar to Anon. Holding it out to him, Rosa smiled, tears shimmering in her eyes. \r\n\u201cMiddlemist Red Camelias, An-on. You show her this, and she will understand.\u201d Stella blew her nose loudly, reduced to a blubbering mess on the other side of the counter. \r\nAnon accepted the flower carefully, twirling it between his fingers slowly as he moved towards the door. \u201cRosa, Stella, I can\u2019t thank you both enough for this. I don\u2019t know how to\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cOh, just go, you pendejo! Before you make Stella cry more!\u201d Stella was indeed weeping now, her face a mixture of emotions too complex for Anon to decipher at first glance. With a final wave back to the two women, Anon pushed himself back into the cold night, the shop bell ringing merrily as he exited. He could see thick clouds starting to form overhead, intent on making good on the weather forecast\u2019s promise of rain. Hold his flower close to his body with both hands, Anon set off on the final leg of his journey: Clawfino\u2019s. \r\n\r\nHe hoped Lucy would understand.

The wind didn\u2019t have very far to go in this small space as it rattled empty take-out containers, swirling around discarded clothes as it circled the small room.

The wind swirled around the still-unpacked room, past boxes left haphazardly throughout the small one-bedroom apartment, rustling the fresh bouquet of flowers with a large \u201cCongratulations!\u201d balloon still tied to the vase. Deeper still it flew, into the bedroom, freshly christened by the young couple of Lucy and Anon. Only Anon felt it, though; Lucy had long since fallen asleep, exhausted from the move out of her parents house and from\u2026 other things. Anon\u2019s bare chest prickled with goosebumps for a moment as he lay there, hands folded behind his head, smiling up at the celling. One month since he and Lucy got back together, one month since his return to Volcaldera after his long stay away from the love of his life. As his eyes drifted shut, Anon listened to the breeze whistle softly through the apartment he shared with Lucy, utterly content at the new life he was about to start.\n\nThe wind blew in from the open window, bringing a new beginning; but it was not the beginning anyone could have imagined.\n\nAnon rubbed the sleep from his eyes, sitting up in his new bed, the shadows of unpacked boxes lingering in the morning gloom. Yawning sleepily, he made his way to the bathroom, the tap sputtering slightly as he washed his face, preparing to face the first day of the rest of his life. Still unused to the new surroundings, Anon cast his gaze around for his toothbrush before realizing it was still packed away. Lucy had been very insistent that they pick up where they left off, and that did not include unpacking right then. \u201cMy parents bought us this bed, Anon. We should break it in, just to make sure it\u2019s a good one\u2026\u201d Smiling, Anon wiped his face on his sleeve: A part of him was surprised that bed was still in one piece! His eyes adjusted to the morning gloom, Anon stared into the mirror\u2019s reflection, angling to get a glance at the woman who had so effortlessly captured his heart.\nLucy wasn\u2019t there.\nFrowning, Anon turned, quickly stepping into the bedroom, the empty room mocking his previously contentment. Something was strange about the room, and not just for the lack of Lucy. The stacks of unpacked boxes seemed\u2026 smaller, the bedframe different. Anon shivered against the breeze that blew in from the opened window down the hall, his panic growing.\n\u201cLucy? Lucy, where are you?\u201d Anon cried out, crossing the room quickly to peek into the closet. Nothing. Calling out again, his footsteps quickened on the hardwood of the hallway, his gaze frantically checking the second bathroom, the kitchen, the living space. Nothing. No balloon, no flowers, no Lucy. It was as if she had just\u2026 vanished, taking with her all aspects of their shared life. Anon could feel his heartbeat ringing in his ears as he rushed back to the bedroom, numb fingers fumbling through his pants pocket for his phone. \n\u201cJ-just out getting coffee, probably\u2026\u201d Anon had never gotten over his mumbling, the frequency always increased in times of stress. Checking his phone, the wrongness of the morning continued. Someone had deleted Lucy\u2019s number from his speed-dial, changed his background from a smiling selfie he had taken with Lucy on the pier to some esoteric landscape shot. The phone quaked in his hands as he punched in a familiar number, one he had memorized since returning: Lucy\u2019s number.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry, the number you are trying to reach is no longer in service. If you would like to-\u201c Anon cut off the robotic voice with a touch of his thumb. His chest felt like it was going to burst, his breathing ragged. Anon quickly tapped up a new phone call, struggling to remember the number of Lucy\u2019s parents\u2019 house.\nOne ring, followed by a second. \nA third seemed to stretch out into infinity.\n\u201cHello? This had better be good buddy, it\u2019s seven in the damn morning!\u201d The rough voice of Ripley crackled through the phone, and for the first time Anon felt relief at hearing the voice of Lucy\u2019s father.\n\u201cRipley, it\u2019s Anon. Look, Lucy\u2019s not a home, did she say anything to you, say she was going anywh-\u201c\nBefore Anon can finish, Ripley cuts him off, nearly yelling at this point. \u201cAnon? Who the fuck is that? Who\u2019s calling?!\u201d A gnawing pit of fear feasts on Anon\u2019s stomach as he takes another deep breathe to calm himself down.\n\u201cAnon, sir, Lucy\u2019s boyfriend? Y-you helped us move in together yesterday.\u201d Anon can\u2019t help but keep the stammer from his voice. Ripley was a strong man, in both mind and body, there\u2019s no way Alzheimer\u2019s could have caught him this fast. Working some moisture into his mouth, Anon continued his desperate plea to the ptero-patriarch on the phone. \u201cI woke up this morning, and she was just\u2026gone, and I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d\n\u201cLucy\u2019s boyfriend? You little shit, how dare you bring her name up to me! I haven\u2019t spoken to Lucy, to Fang in years! Why the fuck would I care if you moved in with that good-for-nothing shit, I ought to run a trace on you and beat the shit outta you, you little \u2013\u201c\nAnon cuts the call off, the phone slipping from his hands. He and Lucy had lunch with her parents just yesterday, and Lucy had lived in their house before deciding on moving into a new apartment with her boyfriend, Anon. Anon, the one currently standing alone, in an empty home, with no sign of the love of his life to be found.\n\nSomething had gone very, very wrong.","encoded":false,"Title":"What

know, Anon decides to join his new High School's sports clubs after its president, the beautiful and outgoing Nasera, convinces him to. Unfortunately for Anon, he's not exactly the fittest human around. Hilarity ensues as he tries to do his best to not only fit into his new role, all the while his feelings for the club's president grow by the day."},"Altered Paths - Nasera Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Naser And Nasera","Altered Paths - Nasera Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Chapter 2: Early Birds\n\nOh? Are you back for more of this story? How interesting. How very, very interesting\u2026\n\nWell, regardless, since you came back, Might as well continue telling this tale \n\nLucky for you, not much has happened since you last saw this reality. \n\nAfter waking up from his nightmares, Anon went about another normal day of school. He saw his classmates as expected, and interacted with the girl that\u2019s been causing him no end of confusion up till now. On top of that, he endured Trish\u2019s grilling over what he and Nasera did the day prior when she led him down the hall, got his usual set of math answers from a still helpful Reeda, survived his science class and the sharp glares of an annoyed Fang, and generally made it through the rest of the day without further incident.\n\nAll in all, it seemed as if the rest of the week would go by uneventully, almost making the human believe that he had imagined the whole interaction with Nasera about the sports club. That knowledge was still a bit spot of confusion for the petite caveman. But can you blame him? It\u2019s not every day that one of the most beautiful girls in school comes to you and asks you to join her club. \n\nIf only Anon knew what was in store for him\u2026\n\nWell, I\u2019ve talked your ears enough as is. Why don\u2019t we pick up this story in real-time?\n\n \n\nThursday Morning...\n\nMy phone\u2019s sudden ring knocks right out of my slumber, almost causing me to roll over to the floor. \n\nAnd I was having such a wonderful dream. \n\nTrying to think back on the details of the dream leaves me with a bit of a blank mind. Fuck, waking up jumbled my memory. Still, it had to have been a nice dream due to the warm fuzzy feeling I still feel in my chest.\n\nI try to ignore my phone\u2019s ringing as best as I can. When it finally ceases, I adjust myself back into bed and prepare to go back to sleep. \u2018Probably some fucking telemarketer,\u2019 I think as I shut my eyes and get as comfy as I can.\n\nThen the phone rings once more, forcing my eyes open yet again. \n\nWith a groan, I sit on the edge of my bed and snatch the phone from my nightstand. I let out an angry sigh and tap the answer button without looking at the caller ID, ready to curse out whoever was daring to wake me at such an early hour of the day.\n\n\u201cLook, whatever you\u2019re selling, I\u2019m not interested in it, especially this early in the morning!\u201d I snap, ready to hang the call, when a familiar tone laughs from the other end of the line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid to ask how often you get marketer calls if that\u2019s how you answer your phone,\u201d Nasera states in a far too cheerful tone for how early in the day it is. \u201cRegardless, this is your wake-up call. Rise and shine, Mr. Mous. Rise and shine!\u201d \n\nI look over to the old and beat-up alarm clock next to my bed. Its red LED display reads that it\u2019s a minute past five in the morning.\n\nFIVE IN THE FUCKING MORNING!\n\n\u201cNasera\u2026 it\u2019s five in the morning. Why are you calling me this early?\u201d A better question would be why she\u2019s even calling a loser like me at all, but then I remember that Nasera doesn\u2019t seem to follow the norms of a school system. You know, the system where the loser nobodies stay in the bottom and get trampled on by the popular perfect paragons of society. I was the loser, of course, and Nasera was the paragon. \n\nThe fact alone that she even acknowledged my existence baffled my mind to no end\u2026\n\n\u201cOh, I know it\u2019s five!\u201d Nasera chirps in a too excited tone. \u201cAnd you should be thankful too. I let you sleep an extra hour!\u201d\n\n\u2018She let me sleep in an hour?\u2019 I muse, my brain incapable of understanding how someone could wake up at such early hours. I\u2019m so baffled that I almost miss Nasera\u2019s following words.\n\n\u201cHumans are diurnal, right? Don\u2019t you guys get up at the crack of dawn to get in a good day\u2019s hunt and gathering, or am I confusing it with nocturnalism?\u201d  \n\n\u2018W...what?\u2019 I think, not quite sure what to make of Nasera\u2019s comment. \n\nOn the one hand, she\u2019s right about humans and daytime activity. On the other hand, why is she even bringing it up in the first place? Also, hunting and gathering? That doesn\u2019t make any sense...\n\nA part of me is very tempted to snap back at Nasera with facts to correct her ignorant views on humans, but then I remember that she\u2019s not exactly an expert when it comes to human-dino interactions to begin with. I don\u2019t think anyone in Volcaldera Bluffs is.\n\nI let out a sigh and eat it for now. \u201cYes, humans are daytime active,\u201d I confirm with Nasera, biting a tongue that wants to add a \u2018but\u2019 to that statement. \u201cStill doesn\u2019t change the fact that we don\u2019t wake up before the sun\u2019s even risen over the horizon!\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, quit your whining, Anon. It\u2019s not winter yet, so you have no excuse to hibernate,\u201d Nasera snaps with a bit of annoyance in her tone. \u201cYou\u2019re part of the sports club. That means you have to be an early bird from now on. You know, like in the old saying? The early bird catches the\u2014crap, what was it again? Something about a bug?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, you mean \u2018worm\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! Worm!\u201d Nasera confirms. \u201cEarly birds get the worms!\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll start getting ready,\u201d I say once again, readying myself to end the call and start the longest morning of my life so far.\n\n\u201cWonderful! I should be there to pick you up in fourteen minutes!\u201d \n\nNasera\u2019s words dispel the last of my grogginess and almost make me jump out of bed.\n\n\u201cW-WHAT!?\u201d I end up shouting loud enough that I\u2019m sure the upstairs tenants got jolted awake themselves.\n\n\u201cGeez, don\u2019t shout my earholes out, Anon,\u201d Nasera says with some hints of annoyance. \u201cI said that I\u2019d be there to pick you up in fifteen minutes,\u201d she repeats with a surprising amount of patience in her voice.\n\n\u201cH-how?\u201d I stammer out, not caring if I sound like I\u2019m having some kind of aneurysm.\n\n\u201cI have a car,\u201d Nasera says flatly, though with a few hints of amusement in her tone. \u201cYou know, a mechanical carriage that has wheels\u2014which I\u2019m sure your people invented way back in the day\u2014 and uses fuel to get people places in a hurry? Can blow up if mishandled too much?\u201d\n\nI again fight the urge to snap at Nasera for her oh-so-casual belittlement of my intellect and instead focus on the main thing she\u2019s trying to tell me. \n\nFor some ungodly reason, Volcano High\u2019s paragon of sporty perfection is coming over to my place, of her own accord, to pick my ass up and take me to school, at dawn of all times...\n\nMy brain\u2019s about to bluescreen trying to take in all the information I\u2019m trying to process at the same time. \n\nI almost end up missing Nasera\u2019s following words.\n\n\u201cAnon? Did you hear me? I said to please try to be ready in fifteen. I don\u2019t want to stick around Skin Row and risk getting mugged, shanked, dino-napped, or all three at the same time.\u201d\n\nI blink and shake my head to try and dispel the stupid as I find myself agreeing with Nasera on her fears about Skin Row. My neighborhood isn\u2019t the best place for a hot chick like her to hang around.\n\n\u201cSo hurry up! Because if something happens to me, my dad\u2019s going to mount your head on his trophy wall, and I\u2019d very much hate having to live with that on my conscience.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, I hang up the call and kick myself out of bed. I can hardly believe what I got done hearing. I pinch myself to ensure I\u2019m not having another dream like the one I had a day ago. When I fail to snap awake in a sweat again, I realize that I\u2019m not dreaming, and that the situation unfolding before me is very, very real.\n\nA girl is coming over to my place. A hot girl. A REALLY hot girl who\u2019s also the president of the sports club; a club I joined two days earlier\u2026\n\nWasting no more time on idle thoughts, I peel off and hit the shower first. I don\u2019t even bother using much soap since I have very little body. I spend less than five minutes washing before I\u2019m flying right out and putting on my usual jeans, worn-out casual shoes, white shirt, and green linen shirt. I stuff my phone into my pocket and shove all my books and other school materials into my backpack without caring how they wind up inside. I\u2019ll worry about organizing my crap when I\u2019m not on the clock. I then run to my kitchen and reach for the most portable food I can get my hands on, that being two paltry and almost tasteless granola bars. Kind of wish I could have a bigger breakfast, but I get the feeling that even cereal\u2019s something I can\u2019t finish in less than five minutes.\n\nJust as I finish stuffing the last of the granola into my gullet, my phone buzzes. I reach into my pocket and pull out the device, looking over at the new message that got sent to me:\n\n \n\n[Nasera]\n\nOutside. \n\nHurry plz. \n\nPlace gives me the creeps!\n\n \n\nI sling my backpack over my shoulder and rush out of my apartment, making sure to lock up the place nice and tight before flying down the stairs and out into the cold and dark morning air. As I do, I can\u2019t help but ask myself a few questions about my current situation. \n\nHow did I get here? Was someone playing some kind of joke on me? How does Nasera know where I live? \n\nMemories of my old life back in Rock Bottom and the doxing incident come to mind. Did someone leak my new address? Do I have to transfer schools again?\n\nFuck. I hate feeling so out of the loop here. Have to ask Nasera what the hell\u2019s going on as soon as I see her...\n\nThe instant I step out of my apartment building, I\u2019m greeted by my future club president, who waves me over to what I assume is her car, though I have to do a double-take because it doesn\u2019t look like something she\u2019d be driving in the first place.\n\nNasera\u2019s ride looks to be some kind of muscle car. It has that whole \u2018high schooler trying to show off\u2019 vibe going for it, yet at the same time, it also looks to be far more functional than showy. Yet, the one aspect that sticks out to me the most is that the vehicle has this horizontal split in the middle. One half looks pristine\u2014right out of the dealership even\u2014while the other half looks disheveled and worn, paint chipping in some parts, and with a small crack near the driver\u2019s side of the windshield.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a unique style. I wonder for a second if its on purpose... \n\nI take one final look at Nasera\u2019s car before rushing forward, opening the door, and taking my seat in the passenger side. As I do, I can\u2019t help but feel uneasy. Here I am getting into the car of someone I had befriended a little over a week ago. Said person I had befriended also happened to be among the top most attractive people in all Volcano High. The only other girl that came close to matching Nasera\u2019s natural beauty was that Stacey girl, and she was head cheerleader.\n\nOh god. Since I\u2019m going to be doing the whole sports thing, I\u2019m going to be seeing a hell of a lot more of Stacey too, aren't I? \u2018Fuck. I\u2019m going to be spilling spaghetti everywhere I go...\u2019\n\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Nasera says, snapping me out of my thoughts. \u201cSpaghetti is a good source of carbs, but I think it\u2019s too early to be thinking about eating it. That\u2019s more of a lunch and dinner meal!.\u201d\n\nFuck. Mumbling. Have to keep a lid on that shit from now on\u2026\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Nasera says as she pulls away from the curb and gets the car rolling. \u201cGood morning! Hope you slept well last night!\u201d\n\nAlmost as if on cue, I let out a yawn, cutting off whatever words I had planned on saying. Not my intended message, but the act still got across how early I felt it was.\n\nNasera rolls her eyes and puts on a warm simper. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard at first, but you\u2019ll get used to this schedule soon enough. Though I do suggest you hit the hay at least two hours earlier from now on. Gotta make sure you get at least seven hours of sleep. Or was it eight?\u201d She taps a finger on her chin in contemplation. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure seven to eight hours is more than enough for most humans!\u201d The ptero cheers in too sugary a voice for me to think it one-hundred percent earnest. \n\nI roll my eyes at Nasera\u2019s suggestion. \u2018Sleep two hours earlier? But that means I\u2019ll miss out on prime shitposting time. How am I supposed to get all those (you)s if I\u2019m dozing off while everyone gets online?\u2019 I think to myself in a bit of annoyance.\n\nNasera lets out a small chuckle, almost as if in reply to my thoughts. \u201cThere\u2019s that word again. \u2018Shitposting.\u2019 I still don\u2019t know what it means, but it sounds\u2026 interesting...\u201d\n\nMy cheeks burn a bit as I again berate myself for not keeping my mumbling in check. Thinking fast, I let out a chuckle of my own and try to play the situation cool as ice. \u201cYeah\u2026 it\u2019s not that important. I\u2019ll\u2026 explain it later. Much, much later\u2026\u201d Yeah, so much later, in fact, that it\u2019ll probably be around the time of the heat-death of the universe...\n\nSoon enough, I notice a change in the surrounding buildings. Gone are the commie-style public housing blocks or the dilapidated buildings speaking of years of neglect and general urban decay. We pass by some industrial zones, and soon enough, it feels like we are in the suburbs, the housing getting fancier with each street we drive through.\n\nNasera lets out a huge sigh. She seems to lose some of the tension in her body as she lets herself slump a bit on her seat. \u201cFinally, we\u2019re out of that shithole,\u201d she says in a harsh tone that, if I\u2019m being honest, does not befit the ptero one bit. \n\n\u201cNo offense, Anon, but your neighborhood\u2019s... crappy. The worst place to live in all Volcaldera. Though, it explains why you have to rely on the school\u2019s lunch card...\u201d\n\nOkay, that one feels like a straight-up slap to the face. I almost lose the fight keeping my emotions and the comments that come with them bottled up. Nasera\u2019s words sting all the harder because I know she\u2019s right, and that fact makes me feel all the more embarrassed about my living situation. Not like I have a choice in the matter. My whole move to Volcaldera was a last-minute thing, and I\u2019m sure it only happened because Spears pulled some kind of convoluted paperwork loophole. Not to mention that I was never well-off to start. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason my hometown\u2019s called \u2018Rock Bottom...\u2019\n\nI let go of whatever resentment is bubbling in me, as well as my desire to educate the dino driving me to school as I instead focus on a much more important question, one that NEEDS answering\u2026\n\n\u201cNasera,\u201d I start, keeping my tone as deadpan as I can despite the maelstrom of emotions raging within me. \u201cHow and why do you know my home address?\u201d \n\nNasera puts on a big broad grin as if she\u2019s pretty proud of some accomplishment. \u201cI memorized it from your forms while Naomi and Principal Spears finalized your paperwork!\u201d she chirps out her answer innocently enough. Not sure if that puts me at ease or makes me feel all the more uneasy. I\u2019m pretty sure that what Nasera did counts as a violation of privacy laws.\n\nBefore I can voice my displeasure over the mild level of doxing on her part, Nasera\u2019s expression grows serious. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Anon. I shouldn\u2019t have access to this information. That it must be some kind of violation of your privacy.\u201d\n\nD-did I mumble again? Is Nasera reading my mind!?\n\n\u201cRest assured, I\u2019m only allowed to know such personal information because I\u2019m the president of the sports club. Your address and medical records are crucial info for me to have on hand in case of an emergency.\u201d\n\nSee, I can understand having my medical information on hand. Sports are taxing and dangerous. But my address too? What does that have to do with it?\n\n\u201cI understand your concern over me knowing something so personal, but I can assure you that the only people who know this info right now are myself, Naomi, and Principal Spears.\u201d\n\nPrincipal Spears knowing my address makes total sense. He\u2019s the principal of Volcano High, after all. But Naomi? Why does she have to know that? Fuck, being class president comes with some unspoken perks, doesn\u2019t it? \n\nThat\u2019s still total bullshit. But well, whatever. At least only three people know that I live in absolute squalor. That\u2019s at least a hell of a lot less than back in Rock Bottom.\n\nI try looking at the positives of my current situation. Nasera seems like she\u2019s professional enough to keep her mouth shut about my living conditions. It\u2019s embarrassing as hell, but she\u2019s at least not Trish, who I know for a fact would LOVE to run her mouth about how I live one step away from literal homelessness. \n\nNaomi, despite how annoying she can be with her sugary disposition that I know for a fact is a front for something shady, also seems to be a professional. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be the class president. They don\u2019t give that job out to anyone.  \n\nAside from that, there\u2019s also the fact that I\u2019m getting a free lift to School. Sure, I had to get up almost two hours earlier than usual, but this beats having to haul my ass four miles through Skin row to get to a proper bus station. \n\nThat did bring up an important question, though. If Nasera wants me to get up so early from now on, does that mean I\u2019d have to walk through Skin Row at such early hours of the morning? Wouldn\u2019t that be as bad as walking through those forsaken streets at night?\n\nFuck. Just when I thought I could coast by without having to carry a knife on my person\u2026\n\nI divert those thoughts away by asking myself what we\u2019d be doing so early in school. Obviously, it's going to be something sports-related, but what exactly? Was it considered a meeting? Were there going to be other people already waiting there for us too?\n\nA very jerky turn of the car derails all my thoughts and makes me realize that, holy shit, Nasera\u2019s flying through the streets at almost sixty miles an hour! I\u2019m sure I make some kind of sound because the one-winted ptero lets out a satisfied giggle.\n\n\u201cAh, I love driving around town early in the morning!\u201d she exclaims as she makes yet another sharp turn, which makes my stomach lurch a bit from the suddenness. \u201cNo traffic, no pedestrians, and all the lights seem to be green. Really lets me cut loose and drive without any worries!\u201d\n\n\u2018Yeah\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure traffic laws aren\u2019t a suggestion, Nasera,\u2019 I end up thinking but not voicing as intended. Though, with my mumbling problem, I\u2019m pretty sure I end up saying it out loud anyway. Nasera gives no response though, so I assume she\u2019s too engrossed with her driving that\u2019s just one level shy of being something out of a stock car race to care... \n\nOne benefit of Nasera\u2019s speedy and reckless disregard of most road laws short of vehicular man\/dino slaughter is that it only takes her fifteen minutes to reach Volcano High. That has to be some kind of record. \n\nThe first thing I notice as Nasera parks her car in the back of the school is how the sun\u2019s nothing more than a few rays of gold on the horizon that barely peek past the mountainous terrain of Dinofornia. The second thing is how eerily empty the school appears so early in the day. If I had once thought the school looked like something out of a Doom wad during the day, the pre-sunrise darkness made it appear like something straight out of Silent Hill. \n\nNow that\u2019s a thought that\u2019s rather horrible to consider, getting stuck in a school while some horror-type shit happens. Would make for a great story though. Didn't I read something similar not that long ago? \n\nNasera and I disembark without a word. I\u2019m not even outside my captain\u2019s car for more than a second before she taps me in the shoulder and motions me to follow. I do, and she leads me into the backmost part of the school, right where the fields and the gym are.\n\nWe stop in front of the gym building, but rather than going through the main entrance, Nasera leads me to the side of the building, right up to a door I assumed led to some kind of supply closet. Before I\u2019m even able to ask her how she plans to get the door open, she reaches for her keys and picks out a worn, nondescript one from the few she has on her key ring, which she then uses to open the door without any real issues.\n\nI have to remind myself that she has those keys because of her position as captain of the sports club.\n\nOnce more, Nasera motions for me to follow her. I do so cautiously. Maybe it\u2019s my paranoid side talking, but it kind of feels like I\u2019m walking into some kind of trap, and I\u2019m about to get knocked out before some insidious school cult harvests my organs. Of course, when the lights come on, I\u2019m only met with an empty hall. \n\nMe and my silly fears. I really do watch too much fucking anime...\n\nWe walk a bit more, and then we finally exit into the gymnasium proper. And I can\u2019t help but be impressed. Rock Bottom High\u2019s gymnasium has nothing on Volcano High\u2019s. The court looks so well-maintained and shiny that I can almost see my reflection on it, and the benches look state of the art. They even have cushions on them, ensuring maximum comfort for any spectators. What\u2019s more, the gym\u2019s so large that it feels as if it houses two entire courts instead of one.\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t get too distracted now,\u201d Nasera tells me, likely taking notice of me ogling my surroundings. She instead once again motions for me to follow. By now, I\u2019m not sure where else the ptero can be leading me. I get an answer soon enough when she holds open another door at the other end of the gym, leading into yet another hallway, one that I recognize this time, as it\u2019s the route leading to the boys and girls locker rooms. Our destination is neither, as she leads me further down the hall, towards what I recognize as one of the offices.\n\nNasera again uses her key to open the door to that office space, the light flicking active as soon as she takes a single step inside. I follow Nasera in. As I do, the first thing that strikes me is the fact that the office is quite messy. There are papers strewn over the table, and sports equipment lies haphazardly placed in shelves and racks. There appears to be some kind of ball pile in a far corner, and for some strange reason that eludes me altogether, the King Rex costume hangs on the wall, waiting for someone to don him and bring merriment to all students and staff alike.\n\nNow that I give it some thought, Volcano High having a dinosaur for a mascot is like Rock Bottom High having a caveman for a mascot\u2026\n\n\u201cSorry about the mess,\u201d Nasera apologizes, snapping me out of whatever train of thoughts I was having. \u201cI haven\u2019t had much time to clean up last semester\u2019s mess.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t mind the mess too much. If anything, it kinda reminds me of my old room back in Rock Bottom. If nothing else, it brings a tiny bit of nostalgia to me, making my current situation not feel as strange as it would otherwise be.\n\n\u201cI have something for you. Hold on a sec!\u201d Nasera announces as she walks into what looks like a supply room in the back of the office. Seconds later, the ptero comes out holding what appears to be a tracksuit, one that\u2019s colored white and red. On top of the folded clothes are a pair of sturdy high-top running shoes, also colored red and white, though more on the red side.\n\nNasera hands me the clothes and shoes, all the while smiling. \u201cTook me all yesterday, but I managed to find you some clothes fitting your exact measurements,\u201d she starts, all the while glowing with pride. \u201cHad to pay our school supplier a direct visit and wait for them to make your clothes from scratch. It turns out that they don\u2019t make outfits for non-dinos, so I guess you can consider your new digs completely custom!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m lost for words. \n\nOn the one hand, I can\u2019t help but feel a bit pampered by all the attention. Then again, if what Nasera told me is true, me being the first-ever human to join the sports club makes me pretty damn unique. At least unique enough that getting custom clothes isn\u2019t out of the question. I just find it difficult to accept everything...\n\n\u201cGo on, try \u2018em on!\u201d Nasera encourages, the smile on her lips not once wavering in its radiance.\n\nWith no way to come up with an excuse not to, I grip the clothes in my hands and head out of the office, down the hallway, and right into the boy\u2019s locker room. It doesn\u2019t take me long to find my assigned locker for PE class. \n\nOver the next five minutes, I input the code after double-checking the note I made for myself on my phone, put on my new digs while stuffing my old clothes into the locker, and slip on my new shoes, making sure the laces are tight, and the straps secure.\n\nI give myself a careful look over. As I do, I can\u2019t help but smile at how comfortable the new outfit feels on me. I don\u2019t know what kind of material the tailor used, but it sure as heck doesn\u2019t feel like your run-of-the-mill cotton. The fabric breathes far too well, and it\u2019s so smooth against my skin that it almost feels like I\u2019m not wearing anything at all. What\u2019s more, the new shoes are the most comfortable pair I\u2019ve ever worn. The soles are soft, the size is perfect, and the straps make them feel secure and airtight, almost feeling as if they somehow have become a part of my foot. \n\nThe new gear feels so lovely and so comfortable that I'm considering ditching my old outfit and making this my go-to from now on. Then I remember the outfit\u2019s only for club use, and some of my happiness evaporates. \n\nThat line of thought sobers me up, filling me with some of the doubts I\u2019ve been having since first agreeing to join the club. A part of me still wants to find some way to get out of it. But how can I when Nasera\u2019s so friendly and accommodating? She even got me brand new clothes for Raptor Jesus\u2019 sake. Would quitting also mean I have to pay for the new digs and shoes out of pocket? \n\nA Knock on the door to the locker room snaps me out of my thoughts. I stuff the last of my belongings into my locker and step outside. Soon as I do, Nasera greets me. She herself looks very different from a few minutes ago. Whereas before she was wearing her usual white shirt and tight red pants, she\u2019s now wearing what looks like a pair of super short and super tight volleyball shorts, a red and white varsity jacket with the school\u2019s logo emblazoned on the upper left side, a knee brace, and a red and white sweatband wrapped around her forehead.\n\nShe looks stunning. I\u2019m not going to lie...\n\n\u201cSo, how are the new clothes?\u201d Nasera asks.\n\n\u201cThey feel great!\u201d I reply with far more enthusiasm than I even expected to voice. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever worn something that feels so soft, breathes so well, yet feels so sturdy.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlad you like it,\u201d Nasera replies with a smile. \u201cOur school uniforms are made out of one-hundred percent Egyptian cotton!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a pretty fucking high percentage. It explains why it feels so good, though. It also answers my question about the price should I decide to quit the club later.\n\nOne more reason to stick around, I guess.\n\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d Nasera says as she grabs me by the shoulder and drags me down the hall and into a small kitchen area, one that looks almost like a teacher\u2019s lounge, except more sparse. Before asking my future club captain what we\u2019re doing in the kitchen, she walks up to one of the many counters and brings out a blender. She plugs the device on the nearest outlet and again turns to the counters. Seconds later, she brings out an almost comically large white tub full of some kind of white powder, which she sets on the countertop before moving to the nearby fridge and taking out a carton of almond milk and some pre-sliced fruit.\n\nOnce she has set all the ingredients on the counter, Nasera turns to face me. \u201cOne or two scoops?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how to answer whatever Nasera\u2019s asking me, so I end up saying the first thing that pops into my head. \u201cT-two scoops,\u201d I stammer out.\n\nNasera nods and smiles. \u201cFour scoops it is then!\u201d she proclaims before opening the tub of white powder and scooping out four pretty seizable cups of what I can only assume has to be some kind of protein powder. By the time\u2019s she\u2019s finished scooping, almost half of the blender\u2019s full of the stuff. She then proceeds to pour at least five cups of almond milk and the sliced fruit into the blender before closing the top and activating the device.\n\nWhile the blender works its magic on the ingredients, Nasera turns back to face me. \u201cYou\u2019ve already told me that you really like the new clothes. What about the shoes? Do they feel nice as well?\u201d\n\nI nod enthusiastically. \u201cShoes feel so great, I think I\u2019m going to use \u2018em as my new footwear from now on. It\u2019ll sure make getting to school so much easier in the mornings.\u201d\n\nNasera turns off the blender, all the while still keeping her eyes on me. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been walking to school this whole past week and a half?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot like I have a choice,\u201d I say, my mood souring a bit. \u201cGotta walk through Skin Row to take a proper bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t buses run in and around Skin Row too?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do, but they\u2019re pretty\u2026 dangerous. Most of the time, they\u2019re hobo hotels on wheels. If I took one, I\u2019d probably wind up getting mugged, shanked, kidnapped, or all the above at the same time.\u201d\n\nNasera blinks a few times, very clearly processing my words. \u201cHow far do you walk to take a bus then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 honestly never given it much thought, but it takes me about an hour to get from my apartment to a bus station that\u2019s safe and brings me across the street from Volcano High. According to my phone\u2019s pace keeper, I do about four miles an hour, so\u2026\u201d I give Nasera a nonchalant shrug. \u201cI guess I walk four miles every morning?\u201d\n\nNasera pours two cups of the protein shake she finished preparing. She then hands me a cup, her expression one I can only describe grim. \u201cWell... As captain of the Sports Club, I can't let my newest member risk his safety just to be a part of morning jogs!\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not that bad. Honestly. I just gotta be real careful where I walk and make sure I stay on the well-lit sides of the streets.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, that\u2019s the problem!\u201d Nasera exclaims, all the while her brow furrows. \u201cLike, did you know that despite only making up about twenty percent of Volcaldera Bluff\u2019s population, skinnies make up more than eighty percent of all reported crime, the majority coming from Skin Row and Little Troodon?\u201d The ptero shivers, not sure if in disgust or fear. \u201cAnd you live right in the middle of Skin Row!\u201d My future club captain looks me in the eye with what I can only describe as worried determination. \u201cThat crap ISN\u2019T going to fly with me! So from now on, I\u2019m picking you up from your apartment at five sharp!\u201d\n\nBefore I can form some kind of protest to Nasera\u2019s pretty ridiculous command, she raises a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear any \u2018buts.\u2019 Only \u2018yes ma'am.\u2019 Got it?\u201d\n\nI swallow hard and nod in reply. That seems to be a good enough Answer for Nasera, who gulps down her protein shake in one single swig before letting out a satisfied sigh. \u201cNow then. Since you say you\u2019ve already been walking four miles daily for the last week, I\u2019m going to start us off with a nice two-mile jog. Drink your shake and meet me on the field!\u201d\n\nBefore I can even form words on my tongue, Nasera walks past me, all the while smiling with a great deal of contentment. I can only stare at the ptero\u2019s hips sway with a hypnotizing allure, said allure amplified by her booty shorts. \n\nThe sight only makes the neurons in my brain start firing off enthusiastically\u2026\n\nTo keep my\u2026 primal thoughts in check, I chug down my protein shake. I expect the drink to taste like absolute shit. Instead, I taste what has to be best god-dam protein shake I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of drinking in my life. My joy at the taste is such that I can\u2019t help but compare it to some kind of elixir. \n\nI put down the now empty cut on the counter and rush out of the office and towards the field as Nasera instructed. As I get my legs moving, I can\u2019t help but feel a sudden rush of energy overtaking my body. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the protein shake or the sudden rush of endorphins at the sight of Nasera\u2019s hot bod, but something\u2019s filling me with energy, and it fucking feels amazing.  \n\nWhen I reach Nasera out on the field, I find her doing stretches. She stops the instant she sees me and smiles. \u201cOh hey, good timing! Wanna join me on the stretches?\u201d\n\nI pause in my tracks and think about what Nasera\u2019s asking me to do. I\u2019ve never done anything that\u2019s remotely physically demanding, so I know almost shit when it comes to doing proper stretches. Something tells me that if I refuse, my muscles are going to make me regret the decision.\n\nI stand next to Nasera and begin trying mirror her movements. Unfortunately, my inexperience gets the better of me me, and I pull too hard in places and wind up giving myself cramps. I fall over, barely keeping myself from shouting out in pain. \n\nThankfully, Nasera is there to stretch my leg out, which makes the worst of the pain vanish. She then helps me back up and gives me a raised eyebrow look. \u201cYou\u2026 uh\u2026 want me to teach you some proper stretching techniques?\u201d\n\nAlready feeling my face grow warm from that particular embarrassment and fearing that if I try again, I\u2019m going to give myself another cramp, I nod in reply.\n\nThankfully, Nasera doesn\u2019t laugh in my face as she should. She only giggles a bit as she begins to patiently guide me through proper stretching techniques, many of which I hadn\u2019t ever seen until now. After ten minutes, we both finish the warm-ups, and it makes me feel so much more limber than before. \n\nHow the hell had I gone so long in my life without doing proper stretches?\n\nWith the stretches out of the way, Nasera tosses me a bottle of water before giving me a quick rundown on some jogging techniques. I listen as she explains how I have to inhale through my nose and never through my mouth, how I should only take small sips of water when thirsty and never drink more than that while jogging less I make myself sick, how I have to make sure the ball of my feet and the toes aren\u2019t parallel when my foot hits the ground, how I have to keep my posture upright at all times and always keep my eyes ahead, and of course that I shouldn\u2019t slouch or less lose a lot of stamina.\n\nQuite a lot to keep in mind for something so simple looking as jogging. Then again, very few things in life are simple if you stop to think about it\u2026\n\n\u201cOh, and one more thing,\u201d Nasera says as she takes her position on the field. \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to slow down if you feel you\u2019re running out of stamina. Better to set a slower pace than stopping altogether.\u201d\n\nI nod and walk out to the field myself. For the first time this morning, I feel like I\u2019m ready to make the most out of something fitness-related.\n\nThat\u2019s a very odd thing for me to think now that I stop to ponder it. It almost feels like some doppelganger is replacing me. Who am I, and what have I done with the real Anon?  \n\nIgnoring that last stupid thought, I give Nasera another smile and a nod of confirmation. She brings out her phone and activates the jogging app on it. \u201cWe\u2019re going for two miles. If we can keep up a pace of four miles an hour, we should finish in about twenty or so minutes. Maybe less.\u201d She puts her phone back into the pocket of her jacket and looks me in the eye. \u201cReady to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d I say a bit absentmindedly as, for the first time since meeting Nasera, I notice how beautiful her amber-toned eyes are\u2026\n\n\u201cThen GO!\u201d Nasera announces as she takes off jogging.\n\nBy the time my brain can process the event, Nasera\u2019s already a good dozen feet ahead and only getting further. \n\nWasting not another second, I order my legs to start moving, and in less than a second, I too am jogging right behind my club captain.\n\nEven though I give it my best, my jogging speed isn\u2019t up to par with Nasera\u2019s. Unless I start sprinting, I\u2019m destined to keep at least a good dozen feet away from the ptero, who seems to enter into a trance as her breathing evens out with her footfalls, creating a level of synchronicity that makes her every move as efficient as it is mesmerizing.\n\nIf I weren\u2019t actively jogging myself, I would have sat down on the bench to stare in absolute awe at Nasera\u2019s physical prowess...\n\n \n\nThe rays of sunlight hit my eyes the instant that ball of burning gas peeks over the mountains. With the light comes the warmth, and with the heat comes more sweat. I still haven\u2019t gotten used to the temperature shifts in Volcaldera Bluffs. It\u2019s not like back home, where the high altitude and mountainous terrain meant it was cool most of the time, if not outright freezing. \n\nNasera long finished running her two miles. I double my efforts despite the burning in my lungs. In comparison, I still have about another lap to go before saying my jog\u2019s done. It puts into perspective how out of shape I am.\n\nI focus on nothing but jogging. That helps me complete my task, though because of my doubled efforts and the fact that I started breathing through my mouth near the end, Feels like I\u2019m about to pass out both from a lack of oxygen and the burning in my throat. Still, aside from that final push, Nasera\u2019s advice about nose breathing did help keep my momentum up. Develop a bit more discipline when it comes to breathing, and I can see myself getting used to this whole track thing.\n\nAs I try and catch my breath, I can\u2019t help but have my eyes wander a bit towards Nasera\u2019s plum hips and rear, her booty shorts once again doing me no favors when it comes to their appeal to my baser primate instincts. What\u2019s worse, now that we\u2019re both nice and sweaty, I can\u2019t help but catch a whiff of her post-workout musk...\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my testosterone feeling high after the workout, the endorphins making me feel all high and mighty, or if there\u2019s some truth to the whole \u2018tomboy aroma\u2019 thing I\u2019ve read so much about in various online forums, but I can\u2019t deny there\u2019s something\u2026 alluring\u2026 about Nasera\u2019s post-workout scent. It\u2019s honestly making it very hard to keep a party from starting inside my trousers...\n\nI shake my head and ignore the thoughts going through my mind. No easy task considering the kind of beauty that\u2019s standing a few feet away from me, though. God, I wasn\u2019t such a lame example of my species. I\u2019d walk right up to Nasera and\u2026 and\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t finish those thoughts as I notice, much to my horror, that Nasera\u2019s walking right towards me. \n\n\u201cGood job on the jog!\u201d the ptero cheers as she closes the distance between us and pats me on the shoulder. \u201cWith that, you\u2019ve taken your first step into the wonderful world of fitness!\u201d she says, all the while giving me the widest, warmest smile yet.\n\nNasera\u2019s words were nothing short of encouraging, yet something about them made me feel a bit uneasy. A part of me still feels strange about becoming so embroiled in a world that I have tried to avoid for so long. But as I look at Nasera\u2019s warm smile and let her words sink into my being, I begin to feel something in my heart that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever really experienced before, a fluttery sensation that fills me with a sense of self-worth that makes me feel like I\u2019m worth a damn for the first time in my life...  \n\nNasera reaches for her cellphone and grimaces. \u201cI was hoping we\u2019d have time to do some cool-down exercises, but we have about ten minutes before the football team, and cheer squad kicks us out of the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t the football team a part of the sports club?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey used to be, but they broke off and became their own department a year before I started attending Volcano High. They do their own thing nowadays and have quite the rivalry with our club.\u201d Nasera lets out a sigh as she again motions for me to follow. \u201cLet\u2019s hit the showers and call it for now. We\u2019ll resume the workouts in the afternoon with the other members of the club.\u201d Before we reach the building, Nasera turns around and gives me another smile. \u201cOh, and before I forget, meet me back in the office after you\u2019re all done. Have to do a brief debrief.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not sure why Nasera wants to debrief me, but I don't argue with her. Probably more information about the afternoon meeting.\n\nGod, it feels weird thinking that. I again have to ask myself what I\u2019m doing and where this is taking me...\n\nI down the last of my water and head straight for the showers. As I do, I start to notice a few students already filtering into the locker rooms. They don\u2019t seem to see me, but I see them and their almost larger-than-life profiles. It doesn\u2019t take me much to realize they have to be a part of the football team.\n\nJesus, how the fuck can you be in high school and still be that big\u2026?\n\nI jump into the shower, do what I need to do to stop smelling like sweat and grime, and slip on my regular clothes, stuffing my new club uniform into the locker. After some consideration, I look down at my old shoes and stuff them into the locker as well. \n\nThank you for all your years of service, but it\u2019s time you guys got a nice long break...\n\nWith that done, I head for the office and meet up with Nasera, who is also back to wearing her usual clothes. \n\n\u201cOh hey, that was fast!\u201d Nasera chirps, taking a seat on her desk. \u201cMight have already told you, but you did really well for your first morning jog. I think you might be ready to increase the length to four miles!\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves,\u201d I tell Nasera with an uneasy grin. \u201cI still struggled a bit towards the end. Fucked up and started breathing through my mouth, which is why I was so out of breath by the time I finished.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Nasera exclaims with genuine surprise. \u201cI\u2026 didn\u2019t really notice that. Though now that you mention it, that would explain why you were looking all addled back there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 let\u2019s go with that,\u201d I say before letting out a single chuckle. \u201cIf I had to describe the jog itself thought, I\u2019d say it was\u2026\u201d\n\nWas it\u2026 great? Wonderful, even? Is that the right word I\u2019d use to describe it? I mean, I don\u2019t have much in the way of reference when it comes to it. Yet, at the same time, the feelings of gratification that I got after finishing is something that I can\u2019t describe but understand all too well as wholly positive.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d I end up saying as sincerely as I can manage to make my voice sound. \u201cOh, and the protein shake before it was also pure bliss!\u201d I say, subconsciously licking my lips.\n\n\u201cYou liked the shake that much?\u201d Nasera asks, her eyes widening and her cheeks growing rosy.\n\nI nod in reply. \u201cBest protein shake I\u2019ve ever drunk! What\u2019s the brand? I wanna get some for myself. I\u2019ma drink it every day before our meetings!\u201d  \n\nMy own words cause me to pause. Wasn\u2019t I thinking about finding some way to quit the club not that long ago? Was a single jogging session all it took to get me onboard? I mean, it wasn\u2019t even an official meeting. More of a trial run...\n\nNasera lets out a giggle and looks to the side, her cheeks now very obviously glowing red. \u201cThe\u2026 the protein powder I use is homemade\u2026\u201d She turns back to face me with a big broad grin on her lips. \u201cI-I\u2019m glad\u2026 that you like it so much\u2026\u201d she stammers out a bit, all the while she fidgets a bit with her hands. \u201c...If you want\u2026 I-I can share the recipe with you\u2026 B-but\u2026\u201d My club captain looks me in the eyes with determination. \u201cI\u2019ll only share the recipe with you if you promise to give it your absolute best in the coming months!\u201d\n\nI once again find myself asking whether I plan to stay on in Nasera\u2019s sports club. Am I ready to commit to something so big so soon? As cheesy as it sounds, my decision could very well have repercussions for my future. Granted, they can very well be GOOD repercussions, but I don\u2019t know that. Not yet anyway... \n\nBefore either myself or Nasera can get out another word, My phone alarm goes off, one I had forgotten I\u2019d set as a secondary in case my bedside alarm stopped working for whatever reason. \n\nI look at my device\u2019s display and see that it\u2019s now 7:00. This would be around the time when I\u2019m waking up and going through my morning routine before flying out of the house, hopefully before 7:30. From there, the four-mile flight to the bus station followed. If all went well, I was usually at school a little before 8:45, which gave me just shy of fifteen minutes before homeroom.\n\nNasera points to my phone. \u201cYeah, you definitely need to adjust your alarm from now on. I suggest you set it to 4:45 so you can be ready by five.\u201d\n\nWith a nod, I do as Nasera instructs. That makes the ptero chuckle a bit, probably because of my enthusiasm or something like that. \n\n\u201cSince you\u2019re here an hour earlier than you normally would be, what\u2019re you planning on doing until class starts?\u201d Nasera asks.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t really know,\u201d I answer. \u201cI mean, I guess I can go to the closest convenience store and get something cheap for breakfast?\u201d\n\nAt my words, Nasera\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cOh, I have an idea!\u201d she exclaims as she stands up from her desk. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have ourselves a REAL breakfast!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m taken a bit aback by the suggestion.\n\nNasera\u2019s response is to give me a wide cheeky grin as she wraps a hand around my shoulder. \u201cMight as well celebrate you joining the sports club, as well as the new clothes, no?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m that comfortable \u2018celebrating,\u2019 as Nasera puts it...\n\n\u201cHey, if you\u2019re worried about paying for the meal, then don\u2019t. My treat!\u201d Nasera chimes in, almost as if sensing some of my unease over the matter. \u201cBesides, this is also a \u2018two birds, one stone\u2019 type thing, since I also have to go pick up my sis\u2014I mean, sibling\u2026\u201d the ptero lets out a tired sigh at those words. \u201cFang got banned from using public transportation after she got into a fight with another passenger. Something about being \u2018misgendered\u2019 or some stupid gender-politic bull. Lady wasn\u2019t really hurt, but she made such a huge fuss that the police had to get involved...\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d I start, but I don\u2019t dare finish my thoughts. \n\nI may not be that familiar with Fang personally. Still, from our cold interactions as lab partners and occasional lunch buddies, Nasera\u2019s sister can be quite the insufferable bitch\u2026\n\n\u201cThat sucks,\u201d I salvage my previously started statement and give Nasera my most sympathetic gaze.\n\n\u201cI swear, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that dad\u2019s in the police force, Fang would be in jail by now,\u201d Nasera hisses through gritted teeth. \u201cBecause of that ban, I\u2019m probably gonna have to chaperone her\u2014them\u2014to and from school for the rest of the school year, or at least until dad can work more of his magic and get Lu\u2014I mean, Fang\u2014un-banned from using public transportation...\u201d\n\nI make a mental note to never mess with Nasera father since he sounds like someone I don't want mad at me, especially if he has enough pull to keep someone from getting arrested for assault...\n\n\u201cLike\u2026 shit!\u201d Nasera suddenly shouts as she lets go of my shoulder. \u201cAs if Fang wasn\u2019t already giving me enough bullshit over the botched concert last week, now I have to deal with this! And all for what? Because they have this enbie phase going\u2026\u201d\n\nI recall the concert vividly. Nasera invited me to go. I went because of free pizza, but I ended up getting a hell of a lot more than I bargained for.  I still feel kinda shitty for laughing at Fang, Trish, and Reeda, even if their music did suck. I mean, two basses? Who the hell uses two basses?\n\nNasera closes her eyes and takes a deep breath to calm herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I suddenly shoved that shit on you, Anon. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d she again sighs and looks down at the floor. \u201cRegardless of whatever she says or does, Fang\u2019s my sister\u2026 and I\u2019m going to do everything that I can as her younger sibling to support her.\u201d The ptero again looks up, her brows furrowing in an expression that doesn\u2019t fit in with Nasera\u2019s natural beauty. \u201cEven if her whole gender act is a way to get attention!\u201d she spits out with far more vitriol than she probably intended. \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I start, already feeling like I\u2019m privy to far more information than I\u2019m comfortable knowing. \u201cSounds like you\u2019ve got a full plate this morning. So\u2026\u201d I rub the back of my neck and try to give my new club captain as easy a smile as I can manage. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we put a pin on the whole celebratory breakfast? I\u2019ll\u2026 leave you to your business\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t wait around to see Nasera\u2019s expression. I turn the fuck around and take a step out of the office.\n\n\u201cA-Anon, w-wait!\u201d Nasera exclaims. At the same time, I feel a hand grab onto my wrist. \u201cI\u2026 I know\u2026\u201d she starts in a soft and vulnerable voice before clearing her throat. \u201cI know we\u2019ve only known each other for a week and a half, but in that time, I feel like you\u2019ve... become a good friend.\u201d She lets go of my arm as I turn around to face her. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a bit too much to ask from someone who I just became friends with\u2026 but... can you stick around while I pick up Fang?\u201d Almost as soon as she asks me that favor, she raises her hands and waves them around as if trying to keep me from getting heated over her words. \u201cY-you don\u2019t have to t-talk to them\u2026 or even acknowledge they are there! I-I-I-I\u2026 I just want someone else there to keep the drive from feeling so awkward\u2026\u201d \n\nI inwardly grumble. The last thing I want is to get mixed up in some kind of family drama. I try to think of a way to get out of the situation unfolding before me, but any idea dies as something else in me pushes me to help out my club captain. \n\nIf nothing else, because I owe her for the new clothes. I\u2019d also be lying if I said that her pretty face also wasn\u2019t a factor.\n\nHowever\u2026\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll help you out,\u201d I reply, causing Nasera\u2019s expression to lighten significantly. \u201cBut,\u201d I add before the ptero can get a word in, \u201cYou owe me an extra-large breakfast!\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal!\u201d Nasera acknowledges with far more cheer than I expected.\n\n\u201cNow \u2018common, we have to hurry if we want to get that breakfast AND pick up my sibling before school starts!\u201d Nasera announces as she leads me out of the office, which she locks up on the way out.\n\nI voice no argument. I don\u2019t say anything as the two of us walk back to the car. I have a thousand and one thoughts going through my mind though, but none of them would make the situation feel any less strange. \n\nNever in a million years did I imagine myself not only joining a sports club, but also befriending its eleven out of ten babe of a captain while also helping her deal with family troubles having to do with a sister who, despite what most dinos may tell you, was a pretty decent nine out of ten, her whole gender rebellion notwithstanding...\n\nWhen we reach the car yet again, I once again can\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow at its looks. \u2018Like, why\u2019s it split down the middle aesthetically? It\u2019s a nice car, though. Definitely unique\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cOh, you like my car?\u201d Nasera asks, smiling as she unlocks her door and pops it open. \u201cQuite the beauty, isn\u2019t she? Even gave her a name: the \u2018Nasera-Mobil!\u2019\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t help but chuckle at the name my captain gave her car. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a cute name\u2026 but it\u2019s also a bit tacky, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t think it\u2019s that tacky\u2026\u201d Nasera says before pouting a bit. \u201cWhat would you name it, since you seem to be in the business of naming things,\u201d Nasera demands, crossing her arms all the while giving me an expectant look. \n\nI stop to think about it for a second. The car's split down the middle, one side clean while the other rough. It matches its owner in that regard, so it has to bear part of Nasera\u2019s name. And the car\u2019s\u2026 well, a car. \u2018Mobil\u2019 is an outdated term, though. It makes it sound like one of those golden-age superhero vehicles designed to sell toys to gullible little children.\n\nSo, Nasera\u2019s Car. Nas\u2026 Car...\n\nI snap my fingers and grin. \n\n\u201cHow about NasCar?\u201d I suggest to my club captain.\n\nNasera\u2019s eyes grow to the size of dinner plates in wonder as she unfurls her arms. \u201cAnon... that\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s an amazing name!\u201d She cheers, running a hand over the roof of her car. As she does, she lets out a laugh as she slides into her seat, something I do to speed the process of taking off along. \u201cNasCar,\u201d she whispers in an almost dream-like tone. \u201cThat\u2019s just so damn creative... No wonder you guys taught us dinos how to use fire and tools and agriculture. Humans are such geniuses!\u201d\n\nI pretend not to hear what Nasera said, even though I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s supposed to be a compliment. I\u2019m too busy basking in the afterglow of my achievement when it comes to coming up with witty, punny names.\n\n\u201cOne more thing to celebrate!\u201d Nasera announces as she ignites the engine, which roars as if also happy about the new name. \u201cTo the newly renamed NasCar!\u201d she declares as she pulls out of the parking lot and flies down the street at more than sixty miles an hour.\n\nI very quickly clip on my seatbelt. The last thing I want is for my time of glory to end with me as a red stain on the NasCar\u2019s window...","encoded":false},"NTR Stands For Naser Topping Retards.txt":{"path":["Naser And Nasera","NTR Stands For Naser Topping Retards.txt"],"text":"Title: NTR Stands For Naser Topping Retards\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Naser and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nNaser pushes me up against the bathroom stall, his large maw devouring \u00a0my lower face as we start kissing. It's just as awkward as it was with Fang when we first tried, but thanks to my experience I'm able to guide him correctly. I run my hands over his lithe muscular back, basking in the moment, before pulling my head away to gasp for air.\n\n\"Shit, Naser. Are you sure? Aren't you and Naomi still a thing?

about how the stream dic has no games  when I was interrupted by phone notification,  a text from a unknown number \n\nhey anon it\u2019s Tobias Rieper heard you need a suit for prom I can help you out with that, I\u2019l be there in 10 minutes \n\nit was ol mysterious uncle toby again, only ever say him at him occasionally at Christmas and easter but I did remember him cause he gave me 500$ every time, very useful for bowing it all on bionicles and bay blades. \n\ngot my jacket and shoes on and make my way down the stairs, and he pulled up right to the lobby door, his car was just like the one in the matrix long black and glossy, as I stepped in to it the I was overcome the smell of leather polish and vinyl, it was immaculate clean inside looked brand new,  we drove on in silence for a while, distracting myself by reading all the replies to my post only with the only sound being the quit hum of classical music coming from the radio, toby interrupted the silence by introjecting  \u201cso   anon how is your education going?\u201d  bit startled I replied \u201coh it\u2019s uh going uh good yeah yeah\u201d satisfied with the answer, we drove on 2 towns over, finally slowing down in the run down part of town\nfinally stopping in front of the store \u201cTommy\u2019s Tailors\u201d\n\nas we both walked through the door tommy welcomed us in saying \u201cwhat a pleasure it is too meet again 47 how may I help you today?\u201d\n\n47? What the hell what kind of stupid name is that, must be a German name banking thing from Milton Fitzpatrick I guess.\n\n47 said \u201cI need a suit for my nephew\u201d tommy replied \u201csure thing lets get started\u201d\n\nthe walls were lined with suits, the nice ones you only ever see in those perfume ads, far too nice for someone like me would ever need\n\nafter what seemed like forever with being measured with a tape it was finally over  \nhe dropped me off and I made my way back inside \n\na few days later a knock at my door came and left a box at my door, and inside was the suit immaculate suit the nicest one I\u2019d ever seen fitted cotton shirt, padded insoles, blood red tie, black gloves and matching a a cuff links. It was even nicer than the one Naser has \n\nand on the day of the prom 47 dropped me off at the front of the school and walked the way up the steps and saw the whole gang up there and I over heard Naser saying \u201canon will never be drip, his broke ass suit from Walmart\u201d, then finally turning to see me Naser stood there agist \u201canon is fucking drip\u201d \u201cwell thank you\u201d \n\nI replied then unfortunately for myself the next thing I said when I saw trish standing there was blurting out \u201cwass goood myy trigger\u201d then presided to reee at me with extreme intensity and proceeded to punch me, time stood still my whole life flashed before my eyes, that\u2019s a lot of shitposting and jerking off, an abnormal amount of times, maybe I need to reconsider my life a little bit, but right now I need to refocus on the incoming punch that\u2019s about to deck my ass, \n\nbut just before it made contact with my face 47 showed up out of no where to intercept it. Trish shocked stood back and slowly walked away but not before 47 took his briefcase and chucked it like an axe at trishe\u2019s face it seemed to have a supernatural tracking ability and it keep going after her just going on and on in awe of what just happened, we just walked in silence, then 47 proceeded to shimmy up the water gutter pipe into the second story window jumping in avoiding all the security cameras, making it to the security room and successfully disconnecting it, slowly making his way to the principles office, Spears was just taking a break from the festivities by watching lucky star on his small room tv, 47 got him to stand up and walk over to the tossed soda can 47 threw, and before he know it 47 was chocking the brute out, even through Spears tried he was no match for 47, before he left he looked at the computer logged on the to the grading system changed anon\u2019s c average to a b+ and tanked trish\u2019s average to a d-,\n\nthen he proceeded to take the suit and dump the body in the near by gym locker, entering the gym no one seemed the wiser seems like all it takes is just the clothes and the glasses and no one will notice, he walked towards the other side towards anon yelling over the music \u201chow are you enjoying your prom so far anon?\u201d anon in disbelief in what he was seeing before him just said \u201cgood yeah\u201d then 47 left to walk over too rosa too woo her in Spanish ","encoded":false,"Title":"An Interesting Uncle","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Agent 47, Trish, Spears and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Expeditions To The New World.txt":{"path":["Other","Expeditions To The New World.txt"],"text":"Title: Expeditions To The New World\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Don Rodriguez\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nThe light crept up above the surrounding canopy, pouring into the clearing in which they stood\nThey circled each other, like two lions one seeking to defend his own territory, the other to sieze it from him. Every moment was dragged out by the surge of adrenaline, every second was used to its fullest, scrutinizng every miniscule twitch or movement, hoping to scry from it some portent of the future and in doing so secure their own.\nHis foe planted his right heel heavier in the ground than previously, he was certain of it, the dust rose higher and there was more of it. But was it a feint?.\nWordlessly his foe answered him, dark blue bearing towards him with a speed he could barely match, only deflecting the mighty blow due to his anticipation of it. Don Rodriguez reeled back as his opponent fell upon him again, escaping with only a graze on his left hip as he dodged the blow.\nHis foe turned towards him and began to strike him, time and time again, their swords singing, as they clashed, a passionate and violent song. \nBoth had wounded each other in the span of a few seconds, Don Rodriguez, cutting his foes tail after side stepping his opponents blow, this would soon be returned by a grazing cut accross his length of his chest.\nDon Rodriguez made a feint towards his right side, his foe raised his blade in response, before he struck his foe's short snout with his left fist, breaking his balance and sending him stumbling backwards. \nAt this opening Don Rodriguez lunged towards his enemy, thruing his blade forwards, sinking deep it into his upper left arm causing it to go limp and his opponent to furiously curse him in a tounge he barely understood as it did.\nSeeing his inhumanly strong opponent now relegated to using one arm, the emboldened conquistador charged towards him again grazing his right leg before dodging back to avoid a sweeping blow, not unlike that of a lumberjack felling a tree, convinced of his opponent desperation after such an attack that left him open, he readied himself for another strike.\nYet this bold and haughty plan was quicky brought low as his opponent, carrying his momentum, lashed his tail at his legs, its end striking like a whip tearing skin and cloth and offsetting the conquistadors balance, knowing that falling would mean death as his opponent would certainly seize upon the opportunity he made every effort to catch himself to the detriment of everything else, only noticing his foe bearing down upon him at the last moment, barely meeting his sword in time. \nThe blows that fell upon him, though lighter than before, were by no means gentle exhausting him as he struggled to make an opening to no avail, a brave attempt at siezing on an opening one of his foes blows had made led to him getting a deep gash across his upper body complementing the earlier graze.\nThe Spaniard seeing the futility of this assault retreated back yet as he did his opponent gave pursuit and cut into his right arm repaying the earlier wound that had been given him. His grip lossened, almost enough to drop his sword, he grasped it now with both hands, in case his right gave out.\nAgain his opponent rushed at him, his earlier speed now thankfully diminished though not so thankfully his strength was just as terrible as it had been, launched a fierce assault upon him resulting in a grazing wound to his left side and a deep gash on his right leg that, by some miracle had not torn into an artery.\nThe latter wound however had caused don Rodriguez to fall and anticipating his death was near his began to say a hail Mary as quickly and sincerely as he could and yet his opponent did not strike him down, instead after he finished his prayer his foe spoke to him.\n\n\"Let it go this war of yours, whoever your fighting for let them die, return to your home if you so dearly want peace\"\n\"No\" He spat coughing up blood as he struggled to rise to his feet \"I won't\" he struggled to stand upright grasping his sword as tightly as his hands would let him \"I can't\"\nStumbling towards his opponent sword in bloodied hand he coughed \"I couldn't return to that life\" again in between coughing up blood he bitterly said \"I wont live as a coward like I used to\"\nThe dark blue lizard moved in to kill the conquistador with mocking slowness and exagerated movements as if an actor in a morality play. An actor who played the role of pride presonified.\nDon Rodriguez lunged forwards, his wounds tearing and blood dancing around him like silk about a dancer from the orient, half a world away. The pain consuming every fibre of his being like a fire lit under him, it dragged every moment out to eternity and he felt weak.\nSo very weak.\nHis sword found its place in the side of the towering blue mass before him piercing his lung and stealing his breath both literally and by its sheer speed and the disregard the conquistador had for his own life.\nBefore the Spaniard could follow through his attack he fell to one knee, the pain of (what he had thought was) his last hurrah too great too bear, while his stunned opponent gasped for his breath \nHe could not die here, he had sworn to return for those unfortunate men of his who had not managed to escape from captivity when he and his company had, he had sworn to return for another also. \nYet if he did nothing he surely would die, but if he fought, not just against the hulking creature before him, but against the pain, against his own body, against the world, he might yet survive\n\nAgain he rose up and charged the lizard before him. As his foe saw the Spaniard, his movements wholly unbeffiting his injured state, his chest (and all his upper body for that matter) painted red, glistening in the dawnlight, so utterly covered in blood that he couldn't tell where he had wounded him. Indeed he had wondered wheater he had really injured him at all, if his sword had in actuallity done nothing to harm him, despite the ample blood to the contrary. \nHe recalled, despite the pressing matter of the undying Spanaird at hand, that the others had called these foreigners gods, then another more treacherous thought, so treacherous in fact that it had taken all his attention away from the current duel, had crept upon him as a cougar creaps upon its prey slowly readiying itself in a long drawn out moment before pouncing upon him\n\"Where they right?\"\nHis trance broke as his foe lunged towards him, deflecting the blade away from his neck only a moment before it struck. It was close, closer than he had wanted it to be, as attested by the deep gash on his left cheeck.\nAgain their swords began to sing, but this song was different from the one before, grim and terrible, like the slow beating of a hammer upon an anvil. \nDon Rodriguez had fallen upon him before he catch his breat, striking him with the same energy he had previously, tearing the gash on his arm further, sending blood into earth below and onto his opponent. Contrasting this, his foe was conservative in his actions not having the same disregard for life, or foolhardiness of the conquistador, yet the bloodloss and exertion had made him sluggish.\nIt for the hulking lizard the blows had grown too fast, he had exhausted himself, more than he ever remembered doing, the Spaniard on the other hand was seemingly unaffected by the blows he had been dealt and the pain he endured.\nSeeing the end was near his foe put all his remaning strength into one last charge against the bloodied man as he had done so earlier, hoping he would have the same luck.\n\n\nHe didn't.\n\n\nHe was too slow, his foe doged around him, his wounds tearing even more, uncaring that his blood was splattering around him, and in a single motion he turned on his right heel and sunk the edge of his sword into the deep blue calf before him, its steel biting into his flesh like the teeth of a straved dog tearing into meat.\nStumbling forwards the lizards instincts commanded that he drop his sword into the beaten ground so he could catch himself and in his injured state (unlike the Spaniard behind him) he could not bring himself to fight against that primal urge\nNow on the ground his instincts had pivoted to self-defense and caused him to scramble towards the sword he had thrown \nDon Rodriguez moved towards him not as a lion towards his equal but seemingly as a vulture towards its prey, stopping just short of where his body lay, the burning crimson of the rising sun at his back, his features obscurred by the light enveloping him.\n","encoded":false,"Title":"Expeditions To The New World","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Don

Lifetime.txt"],"text":"Title: Milhouse And Stacy - The Shitpost Of A Lifetime\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Milhouse and Stacy\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nMilhouse sat on the steps of the school, watching the sun set over the hills of Volcaldera, head in hands. Those assholes, the ones who always picked on him, had stolen his bus fare, and he had no other choice but to wait for his mom to pick him up, like some sort of loser. Sighing, Milhouse scrubbed his eyes with the back of his hands, a hand already wet with tears.\n\n\u201cWell, I AM a loser, I guess\u2026 Why does no one like me?!\u201d He mumbled to himself, wallowing in his despair.\n\n\u201cUhh, maybe it\u2019s because you, like, talk to yourself?\u201d \n\nA voice behind him made Milhouse jump. Scrambling to his feet, hands half-raised automatically in self-defense, Milhouse couldn\u2019t believe it: It was Stacy! Head the cheerleading squad, leader of the Spirit Club, and all-around school bimbo, Stacy was the last person Milhouse expected to stumble over him.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, Stacy?\u201d Milhouse\u2019s voice was tight, cold with resentment. Stacy represented everything he hated in school: The popular, the pretty, the successful. It irked him how Stacy always coasted through her classes, seemingly more interested in how she was dressed than what the teachers were saying. Somehow, she always managed to scrape together a passing grade. \u2018Probably by sleeping with the teacher\u2019, Milhouse added to himself.\n\n\u201cLike, what does it look like I\u2019m doing, geek?\u201d Stacy gestured to herself, to the cheerleading outfit she was wearing. Oh yeah, it was so late now, practice must\u2019ve gotten let out\u2026 Face reddening, Milhouse couldn\u2019t help but cast his gaze up and down Stacy\u2019s body, telling himself he was just looking at her uniform. Stacy was built like a brick shithouse, with a huge rack and massive ass that barely squeeze into her tiny cheerleading outfit. Her cleavage alone could consume his entire face, and there wasn\u2019t a guy in school who hadn\u2019t dreamed about being suffocated between those huge tits.\n\n\u201cI heard those guys, like, stole your money or something.\u201d Stacy\u2019s voice snapped Milhouse out of his thoughts. For once, the youth was glad of his baggy hand-me-downs he wore to school. \u201cThat was, like,  suuuuuuuper lame of them.\u201d\n\nMilhouse favored her with a guarded look, one eyebrow raised. Why was she being nice to him? Stacy never said anything to Milhouse, despite the fact they sat right next to each other in class, next to that weird albino goth girl. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you, Stacy? Looking for some poor sap to pay for your next shopping trip?\u201d Not caring about the acid in his voice, Milhouse resumed his staring off into the sunset, settling back down on the top step. \u201cJust leave me alone, okay?\u201d Glancing over his shoulder, Milhouse could see Stacy hadn\u2019t made any move to go, the big-titty airhead cocking her head to study him.\n\n\u201cUgh, you\u2019re such a loser! Listen, I, like, wanted to do something nice for you, so are you gonna\u2019 let me, or what?\u201d Stacy replied frostily, eyes narrowing. Milhouse felt his stomach drop at once, his eyes averting in shame.\n\n\u201cMan, I\u2019m sorry Stacy. Those guys just pissed me off.\u201d Milhouse could feel himself blushing: This was the longest he had talked to a girl who he wasn\u2019t related to, let alone the school fuckdoll. \u201cWhat was it that you wanted, Stacy?\u201d\n\nRolling her eyes, Stacy let her gym-bag drop to the stoop, pulling her hair back into a loose ponytail. \u201cSee, that\u2019s, like, everyone picks on you, Milhouse. You take everything so personal.\u201d From\u2026somewhere in her cleavage Stacy had pulled out a tube of lipstick, the pastel green contrasting nicely with the red stripe running down the middle of her face. \u201cYou just gotta\u2019, like, let loose.\u201d \n\n\u201cWait, wha-\u201c Milhouse turned back to her, totally bewildered by what she was saying. Before he could finish his thought, though, Stacy leaned over, her massive breasts, each easily larger than Milhouse\u2019s head, hanging pendulously beneath her chest. Unable to stare at anything else, Milhouse\u2019s gaze was fixed on Stacy\u2019s ponderous titflesh. Fuck, was that a beauty-mole peeking out of her shirt?!\n\nSlowly, Stacy raised Milhouse\u2019s face to her own, leading the entranced teenager by one long-nailed finger under his chin. \u201cMy eyes are, like, up here, big boy.\u201d Her bitchy bimbo voice was gone, replace by a sultry tone that tented Milhouse\u2019s pants even more. Slowly, Stacy lowered her lips the final interceding inches, planting a wet smack on his forehead, right below his frills. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go, like, shooting up the school, okay Milhouse?\u201d Stacy said, straightening up with a smile. Leaving the paralyzed Milhouse sitting there, a pastel green kiss mark just barely not blending in with his natural scale color, Stacy collected her gym-bag before heading down the stairs, her hips swaying seductively. Eyes draw to her like a moth to a flame, Milhouse could actually see her ass cheeks poking out from under her tiny cheerleading mini-skirt.

Reunion\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Amber and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n    Now it was the present moment. It had always been.\n\n\tThey walked without clear destination across the quiet beach, the husband, the wife, and their child. Footsteps only audible by their faint impact against fine pale sand accompanied the family's silhouettes, defined against the setting sun's illumination which blanketed the entire visible coast in its signature orange gold. The summer breeze, warm and thin, joined the minute percussion of the family's steps in concert with the rhythmic tidal whispers which hovered over the face of the waters. \n\n\tThe husband, human, and the wife, winged reptile, stood together and in near lock step as if they had been one flesh. In her arms the pterosaurine woman held their daughter - no more than seven years old - and both of the excitable girl's parents engaged in continuous playful conversation as they continued leisurely across the serene shore. The child had received the vast majority of her traits from her mother, who even now she unmistakably reflected in appearance, tiny feathered wings flapping excitedly against the woman's hold as her citrine eyes gazed into perfect replicas. \n\n\tThe mother's wider and matured wings trailed gracefully behind her as she walked in contrast to that of her offspring's, and her silvery hair which she had also passed on to her daughter fell gracefully at her sides, shining in the familiar sunset's rays. She wore a plain yellow sundress with a decorative red bow, a golden pendant worn as a necklace around her neck, that same shade which had colored their lives, and a similar miniature counterpart of the outfit was worn by her daughter in a shade of vibrant pink. Matching her height beside her was the woman's husband, dressed in plain khakis and a dark green dress shirt, his face now aged ever so slightly compared to the day of their child's birth but still absolutely unchanged in the expression of pure love with which he never failed to look upon the two loves of his life.\n\n\tOnly a scant few passerby now graced the beach or its surrounding area, hums of passing vehicles a rare and distant occurrence which did little to disturb the tranquility of this seaside vista. Gradually, the family's strolling gait slowed and they giggled collectively over some frivolous revelry that had happily beguiled them. There was a prolonged pause as the mirth settled down, and then the girl had inquired about something to her mother, who in turn looked towards her husband in contemplation before returning her attention to the child and nodding in assent to what had been requested. She brought her long snout towards the child's equally beaked face and pecked at the young girl's cheek, and then she descended along with her daughter in her arms to the earth below, letting her hold on the child go once tiny feet touched the ground. \n\n\tImage of the parent, the daughter proceeded from her mother and onto the waiting sands, therein unfolding a receptive feminine reflection of the world around and within them. The girl took in for a still moment the sights of the littoral expanse, and then she kicked off her shoes and stepped forward, slow and tentative at first but then rapidly transitioning into first a brisk jog and then a practical sprint, no barrier now present to whatever she may tread upon. She ran across the shore, glittering waves behind her continuously coming to rest with the land at the coast in the ancient dance that the Lord had set there in innumerable eons past. And she was dancing, too. Hopping about aimlessly at first, and then twirling around, once, then twice, peels of innocent laughter escaping her beak and her small wings unfurled, the motions kicking up fine grains of crystalline sand which clouded briefly around her form like points of sparkling light in a fine mist. \n\n\tA few gulls gathered on nearby rocks, perched and silently watching one of their long distant evolutionary cousins pirouette along the coastal stage. She trusted the earth beneath her feet and the heavens above her head without reservation, and they happily responded in kind. The magnificent solar rays, from the same sunset which had seven years ago christened her with the name of their gleaming brilliance - Amber - painted the sky in their trademark luminous golden orange, generously imparting their warm tones upon all they touched. Across from the shining tangerine descent of the sun, the moon had already arrived above the horizon, ahead of the night, eager to join in the stellar waltz. \n\n\tAnd along the golden beach, and on through the quiet nearby roads, and further still into the heart of the city of Volcadera, like a relaxed and harmonious exhalation, all became tranquil. Far from where Amber danced, shops littered along the district of Little Troodon slowed in their activity, with only a few last tentative customers idly perusing about, most still present having found a place to settle and take in the sights of the vibrant evening, tiny snippets of their conversations serving as windows into hundreds of lives equally as dazzling as the sunset above them. The interior of Dino-Moe's, illuminated as it had always been by empyreal light from its large front windows, bustled with patrons anticipating its renowned dinners - as it always had. Beyond and deeper yet into the town, past serene suburban roads and onto the school district, stood Volcano High, emptied for the summer, standing as a hibernating monument in brief repose against the beaming citrine welkin before the time would come again for it to open its halls to a new flurry of young memories, experiences, and dreams. \n\n\tAnd there surrounded the building still the verdant gardens that had remained carefully tended to by successors of their original attendant, as colorful and as lush as they had been years ago, a couple of bumblebees studiously perpetuating the process of pollination, their fuzzy bodies rustling small portions of the flowerbeds as they hovered to and fro. Above, and overlooking the vacant parking lot, wind passed across the surface of the school's roof, rattling gently the chain link fence which surrounded it and the metal ladder affixed to the end of an elevated section that rose higher still. The roof's concrete floor had long been dry of the tears that had long ago fallen from a quivering snout, long quiet of the soft notes from an old guitar fashioned into a makeshift hall pass that had sounded off through the air during countless songwriting trysts. Distant sounds of vehicles traversing the surrounding city's roads grew less frequent, a soothing peace settling in the warm summer air and embracing the vast expanse of urban settlement. Here was a city at rest, evening breeze passing through the streets as air released from great paved lungs, bathed in amberlight radiance.\n\n\tOn the beach, the child's parents stood shoulder to shoulder, the mother's wings unconsciously moving to bring one of their feathery spans across the shoulder of her lover. He leaned in towards his wife - his Lucy - and whispered something to her softly, which caused her snouted mouth to curl into a warm smile and her glistening orange eyes to grow watery as a single tear fell down her cheek, touched by the words he had said to her that only the two of them were privy to. And she brought the lips on the end of her long muzzle to his - a practice they had both become extraordinarily familiar with - and delivered a chaste kiss, before they both turned towards their daughter who twirled in tandem with the rhythm of the crashing waves, looking upon her with a singular and unified love which surrounded and guarded her like an all-pervading sentinel.\n\n\tWithout a sound, Amber felt her parents wordlessly calling to her across the sands and the waves, and she pivoted towards them, sprinting with her arms flung out to her sides and wings fully extended, flapping joyfully against the wind. She was carried a few inches into the air briefly by the feathery motions, flying in the golden sky's light, before her feet touched down again to the ground, drawing closer to the waiting arms of her mother. Then she leapt forward and returned into those outstretched arms of infinite, luminous compassion from which she had come, and it was if she had never left.\n\n\n\n\t\"On the vast canvas of the Self\n\tthe picture of the manifold worlds\n\tis painted by the Self itself\n\tand that Supreme Self\n\tseeing but itself\n\tenjoys great delight.\"\n\t\t-Adi Shankaracharya, Svatma Nirupanam","encoded":false,"Title":"Reunion","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Amber and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"The Queen.txt":{"path":["Other","The Queen.txt"],"text":"Title: The Queen\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Amber, Samantha and Ripley\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n~The Queen~\n\nThey never think to check behind the recliner. Like a shadow in the night, I am invisible here. My Halloween costume still fits snugly, and my ninja daggers are at the ready on my belt. Mom and Dad tried to hide the costume from me, but since they're gone for the weekend, they can't protect it anymore. I had to climb up to the highest shelf in their closet when Grandma and Grandpa weren't looking. The enchanted outfit fills me with mystical power, and once again, I have reached my full potential. From the dining room, I hear the sliding glass door open and mumbled voices debating something. My targets are nearby, but I must wait for the perfect moment to strike. I pull out a throwing star from my pocket, readying myself to spring like a panther.\n\nThe voices get louder and louder as my targets enter the living room, placing themselves in my sights. Wait for it...\n\n\"Sweetheart, you know how she is. She wouldn't just run away, I don't think-\"\n\n\"I'm not risking it, Samantha. We're calling the station.\"\n\nGrandpa steps towards the end table and picks up the home phone. This is my moment. As he begins to dial, I silently exit my hiding place. He's very tall, but the bigger they are, the harder they fall. As I leap onto the sofa, Grandpa turns, and the last thing he sees is a throwing star zipping straight toward his head. My perfect throw hits; the star bonks him on the forehead before falling to the floor. As he recoils in shock, I jump off of the sofa and unfurl my wings, dramatically slowing my descent to the ground and landing in the middle of the living room. I draw both of my daggers as Grandma turns to me, preparing my fighting stance and beginning my grand speech.\n\n\"Under the new moon, my blades will strike true!. With the power of the night, I will be your last sight!\"\n\nBoth stare at me, motionless; I can sense their pure fear as I finish my speech.\n\n\"I am Amber Mous, the Shadow Queen of Volcadera! Prepare to take your final breath!\"\n\nI look at both of my targets. Grandma begins to look relieved, but Grandpa starts to look really mad. He looks like he's about to yell, and I can't help but be scared until Grandma suddenly grabs his arm really tight.\n\n\"Ripley, dear.\" She says, putting her other hand on his shoulder. Grandpa stops, and it looks like he's not as mad.\n\nStill, while pointing at me, he says, \"Amber, you.. *Don't* do stuff like that! Do you know how long we were looking for you?\"\n\nI don't know how long I was hiding, but I think it was awhile. I can't help but start to feel bad. I didn't mean to make everybody sad. Pouting, I look down towards the ground.\n\n\"I.. I was just trying to have fun.\" I say, trying to apologize.\n\nGrandma takes a step toward me, crouching down on one knee as she whispers, \"I know, honey. We were just worried about you.\"\n\nShe places a hand on my shoulder, and I look up at her. She's smiling at me, and I don't feel bad anymore. Grandma always knows how to make me feel better; I drop my plastic daggers and give her a big hug as thanks. She's happy to hug me too, and I even notice that Grandpa isn't mad anymore. He starts to look sad, and I'd give him a hug too, but he starts to walk towards his recliner, the one I was hiding behind. He grabs a magazine from the little end table next to the chair and basically shoves his face into it when he sits down. I let go of Grandma, and she looks at him, too. I expect her to say something to him, but she just looks back to me.\n\n\"Amber, honey, you should go change out of that costume.\" She says, trying to coax me into following Mom and Dad's rules.\n\nI don't even try to mask my disappointment as I whine, \"But Graaaandmaaa, I really like it. Just for today? Pleeease?\"\n\nShe thinks for a bit before telling me, \"You don't want to get it dirty when we eat lunch, do you?\"\n\nMy heart skips a beat as I realize what she just said. With barely contained excitement, I stutter, \"W-What's for lunch, Grandma?\"\n\nShe looks at me with a knowing smile, saying, \"If you change, I can put some dinosaur n-\"\n\nThat's all I need to hear. Before she even finishes, I pick up the plastic daggers from the ground and turn tail, running back to my room in a frenzy. I push the door closed behind me, trying to take the costume off with surprising difficulty. I finally do, and since Grandma never said anything about *what* to change into, I put on my pajamas; the really comfy ones I got for my birthday. I open my door back up, running back through the house. I find Grandma in the dining room, taking out a baking pan and some tin foil from the cabinets. As she turns to me, I unfurl my wings and strike a pose.\n\n\"Tada!\"\n\nShe stares at me for a little bit. I start to wonder what's wrong, but then she just starts giggling.\n\n\"Mph! Hmphgh! Oh, honey, you're adorable!\" She says, a smile shining brightly across her face. She comes up to me again and scoops me into a surprise hug; I didn't expect it, but I hug her right back. Grandma really is the best.\n\n\n~\n\n\nMe, Grandma and Grandpa are all sitting at the dining room table now. I look down at my plate; Grandma gave me a whopping ten dino-nuggets with ketchup, and she said there's still more! Grandma made herself a tuna sandwich, and made Grandpa a ham sandwich. They're both eating quietly, not saying anything to each other. I might have noticed, if I wasn't busy chowing down on my favorite meal. I think to the near future; maybe we can watch a movie on the big Tee-Vee! Before I get a chance to say anything to Grandma, Grandpa stands up from his chair. It looks like he's done eating.\n\n\"I'll- be outside.\" He says. Grandma looks up at him, and looks kind of disappointed.\n\nShe looks toward him and says, \"Ripley, you told me you'd stop.\" Grandpa is silent for a moment, before sighing.\n\n\"I'm trying.\" He says, before leaving the dining room entirely and walking for the front door. He does go outside, shutting the door behind him. Grandma looks a little bit sad, until she notices me looking at her; she starts smiling again.\n\n\"Don't worry, honey. Grandpa isn't feeling very well right now.\" She says, continuing to eat.\n\nI try to keep eating my dino-nuggets, but I can't help but feel sad. I don't want to let him be outside alone if he's not feeling well. I decide to stand up, too; Grandma looks at me as I start leaving the table.\n\n\"Amber, what are you doing?\" She asks.\n\nI turn around, puffing my chest up as I say proudly, \"I'm going to cheer Grandpa up!\"\n\nGrandma looks like she wants to say something to me, but just smiles and nods. I walk out of the dining room and towards the front door, following his steps. I open the door, looking outside; Grandpa is sat upon the steps of the porch, holding his magazine in one hand and a smoking stick in the other. He turns his head toward me, surprised to see me, before I practically jump toward him.\n\n\"Grandpa, Grandpa! What's wrong?\" My shouts echo father than I intended them to, but nobody else in the neighborhood is outside. He looks at me, and his eyes look sad before he turns away again.\n\nHe whispers, \"Amber, honey.. I'll be in soon.\"\n\nRight before I begin my impassioned speech about honesty, trust, and love, I take a deep breath. Suddenly, I start coughing in disgust, waving a hand around my head. Grandpa looks to the smoking stick in his hand, dropping it to the floor and crushing it with his shoe as he mutters, \"Sorry about that.\" With the smoke gone, I can speak again.\n\n\"Grandpa, I think you're sad. Aunt Rosa always says boys hide it when they're sad. What happened?\" I ask. He doesn't look at me, he just keeps staring off into the distance somewhere. I continue to stare at him with an unerring gaze, hoping to get some kind of response.\n\nEventually, he sighs and says, \"Honey, a good friend of mine.. left town a few weeks ago. I'm upset about it. That's all.\"\n\nI frown, and decide to sit on the steps next to him. I know what it's like to lose friends, too. To cheer him up, I tell him, \"Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm sure you have lots of friends, so I think you'll be okay.\"\n\nTo my disappointment, my words don't seem to help; he makes a very flat face before saying, \"At my age, you start to run out.\"\n\nI don't know what it's like being old, but I do know how friends act. I decide to show one of my best friends in the whole world how I feel; I give him as big of a hug as I can from the side. He turns his head towards me again. \n\nMy words come straight from my heart; \"No matter what happens, you'll always be my friend.\"\n\nFinally, Grandpa starts to smile. After a bit, he starts to hug me, too; I feel happy that I made one of my best friends feel better. As we're wrapped up together, he utters the words, \"Thanks, Amber.\"\n\nWe hold each other for a long time. Eventually, we start to let go of each other, but I keep leaning my head on his arm. He looks at his magazine again, and I get a good look at it this time. The cover has a human man swinging some kind of metal club. I only recognize it when I read the word \"GOLF\" written in big white letters on the top of the page.\n\n\"Oh! I love minigolf!\" Lifting my head off of his arm, I look at Grandpa and excitedly ask him, \"Do you like minigolf? We should go minigolfing!\"\n\nHe looks at me, then back to the magazine. Then back to me, then back to the magazine. Finally, he just looks at me, and another smile creeps onto his face. He starts to look just as excited as I am, and even laughs a little bit.\n\n\n\"Yeah, honey. We can go minigolfing.\"\n\n\n~END~\n","encoded":false,"Title":"The Queen","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Amber, Samantha and

Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nGarden of Rosa -After Dark-\n\nRosa pulled me quickly through the front door of the apartment, pushing me against the door as it shut behind us. In seconds she was on me, her tongue thrusting deep within my mouth as she hooked her hands underneath my shirt, practically tearing it off me before resuming our slopy kissing. My hands reached out to grab her ass through her skirt, fingers digging into her thick cheeks as Rosa moaned against my mouth. Not stopping there, I moved one hand to her massive breasts, kneading the massive mound beneath her shirt as I teased her hardening nipples. That elicited more than just a moan from Rosa, the gasp escaping her lips before she could hide it behind a breathy giggle. \n\n\u201cMmmm, An-on, so forceful!\u201d Rosa ran her tongue along my ear, her voice a seductive whisper. \u201cYou want to see more, papi? Do you like my nice. Thick. Body?\u201d Rosa punctuated each word by grinding herself against me, pressing her ample tits against my bare chest as her hands caressed my rock-hard cock through my jeans. \u201cTake my dress off, An-on\u2026\u201d \n\nMy hands leapt to obey, my desire to fuck this sexy Latina nearly overriding my desire to tease her more. Managing some semblance of control, I slowly pull Rosa\u2019s floral-print dress up, letting it catch on her ponderous ass before freeing her cheeks with a soft -clap!-, her lacey black-and-red panties barely hiding her full bush. Rosa purred in delight as her dress went higher, exposing her slightly pudgy belly, raising her arms as her dress traveled over her massive rack. It let the dress catch on her tits for a moment, savoring the sight of those huge breasts dropping out of the loose fabric. Rosa\u2019s bra matched her panties, the same lacey black-and-red material straining to contain her bountiful bosom. Finally the dress was off, and I discarded it carelessly as I went back to tongue-fucking Rosa\u2019s mouth. \n\nRosa herself seemed glad to be out of her dress, attacking my pants with renewed vigor, moaning in delight as her hands swiftly unbuckled my belt. Breaking our make-out session, Rosa planted kisses down my chest and abdomen as she crouched before me, her crimson eyes staring seductively up at me as she nuzzled the growing bulge in my boxers, kissing and licking my member through the thin fabric as she tugged my pants down around my ankles. \n\n\u201cOooh, An-on, es tan grande\u2026\u201d The boxers didn\u2019t last much longer, my dick springing free and slapping Rosa across the face with a soft -plop!-. Rosa\u2019s eyes crossed as she struggled to focus, my dick sitting too close to her face. It was easily as long as her face, pre-cum drooling down off my tip and onto her auburn hair. Another soft giggle escaped Rosa\u2019s lips as her long tongue ran up the length of my shaft, careful to keep her nose-horn safely away from any fleshy parts. Reaching the end, Rosa planted a chaste kiss on my slit before standing up, quickly stripping her bra and panties off as she did so. Taking my cock in her hand, she slowly stroked my throbbing member as she lead me further inside the apartment. \n\n\u201cI know ~just~ what to do, An-on. Come, si\u00e9ntate a mi lado!\u201d Giggling, Rosa dropped herself onto the soft couch of the living room, patting the space next to her. Smiling quizzically, I took my place next to her, our hands immediately exploring the other\u2019s body as if drawn by magnets. Free from the bra, Rosa\u2019s tits felt heavy, each massive milk-jug easily bigger than my head, her bright pink nipples standing in stack contract to the pale skin on the front of her body. Free from my boxers, my dick twitched eagerly in Rosa\u2019s hand, her fingers softly tugging up and down my length, using my drooling pre-cum as lube. \n\n\u201cJust lean down, mi amor, that\u2019s it\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s hand cradles my head as she lowers me onto her lap, gazing down at me with almost motherly affection. My view of her face is spoiled somewhat by the fat fucking pair of tits lying on top of me though, and as I struggle to shift into a position where I can see Rosa clearly she coos softly, guiding my mouth to her right breast, still stroking me off with her other hand. \n\n\u201cShhh, shhh, that\u2019s it mi amor. You like my big fat tits, don\u2019t you? Such a ni\u00f1o malo, An-on\u2026\u201d My mouth clamps down on Rosa\u2019s nipple like a babe to their mother\u2019s breast, teasing the small nub with my tongue before sucking eagerly, my eyes closed. Rosa quickens her strokes, twisting her hand around my cock with each pump, a wet -schlick- -schlick- -schlick- echoing through the empty apartment. \u201cThat\u2019s right, suck on that huge fucking tit, An-on. Mmmm, your cock is so r\u00edgido! I can barely get my hand around it, it\u2019s so\u2026 big!\u201d Peeking, I can see Rosa admiring my cock as she pumps her hand on it like a pussy. Her technique is wonderful as she alternates between teasing my tip with her thumb and using just her thumb and forefinger to slide across the head of my shaft. At this point we don\u2019t even need lube, my dick leaking profusely.   \n\nBut Rosa wasn\u2019t the only one with skills. Rosa\u2019s increased pace makes me suck harder, letting her nipple pop out of my mouth repeatedly before flicking it with my tongue. I can her Rosa moaning in delight each time I latch onto her breast, and she begins to squirm under me, her soaking wet pussy hot against my back.  Using my free hand, I play with her other massive milker, alternating my nipple-pinches in time with my tongue-flicking. The combined efforts on her titflesh sends Rosa into overdrive, causing her to scream and pant, her hand becoming a blur on my throbbing cock.\n\n\u201cFUCK! Ao-on, yes, just -ah!- like that! \u00a1Ohhh, si si si si si SI SI SI!\u201d I quickly my attack on Rosa\u2019s tits, biting her nipple softly in time with her screams. Rosa herself keeps her focus on my cock, pumping her fist along my length faster than I\u2019ve ever seen something move before. I\u2019m leaking like a faucet at this rate, giving her hand a smooth glide up and down. I know I can\u2019t keep this up; feeling my orgasm building, I redouble my attack on Rosa\u2019s ponderous titflesh, sucking and twisting like my life depends on it. \n\u201c\u00a1Me estas -ah!- volviendo loca! \u00a1M\u00e1s duro, papi! \u00a1Dios m\u00edo, SIIIIIII!\u201d Rosa arches her back, thrusting her breast even more into my face, blocking my airflow. Beneath me, I can feel her pussy convulse, her legs twisting and grinding together. At the same time I achieve my own release, moaning into Rosa\u2019s chest as my penis throbs. My cum rockets into the air, each spurting rope falling back into us with a wet -plop-. Some even cascade off the side of the couch, splattering against the hardwood floor nosily. Rosa still doesn\u2019t let up, her hand pumping out more and more of my thick jizz, each rope that falls back onto her just adding more lubrication for her strokes. \n\nAfter what feels like minutes, I can feel my orgasm subside, my nuts slowly unclenching after delivering their sticky payload. I\u2019m suddenly aware that I\u2019m being smothered by Rosa\u2019s fat tits, the thick Latina still stroking my softening member as she holds me to her breast. Rosa\u2019s squeals of delight have fallen silent as well, and she stares down at me, panting, her eyes glowing with a lustful light. Each breath Rosa takes makes her chest bounce slightly on top of me, the weightiness of her tits pinning me to her lap. Her hair is a mess, thick ropes of errant cum clinging to the few parts of her luscious locks not already slick with sweat. The breast lying on my chest is likewise covered in spunk, as is my abdomen and, from the feel of it, most of my legs. Finally, Rosa lets me pull free from her breast, thick strands of drool still clinging from my mouth to her nipple, fixing me with a horny stare.\n\n\u201cAn-on, you were supposed to cum insid-\u201d \n\nThe rest of Rosa\u2019s sentence is cut off by an ear-splitting shriek. Springing upward, I can see Stella standing there, staring at us wide-eyed, her hands covering her mouth. The pizzas we sent her to pickup lay on the floor beneath her, their contents spilled across the floor. \n\n\u201cRosa! Anon! Wha\u2026 What the heck is this?!\u201d Beginning a stammered apology, I attempt to sit up, the effort proving fruitless. Rosa still pins me beneath her bosom, her hand idly tracing up and down my sticky shaft. For some reason the sexy Latina is smiling at me, watching me struggle with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. \n\n\u201cRosa, you started without me!\u201d\n","encoded":false,"Title":"Garden Of Rosa -After Dark-","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Rosa, Stella and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Anonymous"},"Garden Of Rosa -After Dark- Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa -After Dark- Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Garden of Rosa -After dark-\n\nChapter 2 \n\nStella\u2019s words cut through my sex-addled haze. My eyes flickered between Stella and Rosa, the former just barely visible around Rosa\u2019s massive boobs, still pinning me to her lap. To my erotic horror, I could see Stella starting to strip, her clothes quickly flying down to join the pizza as she prepared to make good on her words. Stella\u2019s body was magnificent; not nearly as thick as Rosa\u2019s, but her tits were just as massive, her large areola perfecting framing her already-hardening nipples. As Stella pulled down her striped panties (because of course they were), I could see her pussy was already soaking wet in anticipation.\n\n\u201cAy, seems someone else is a little eager, eh An-on?\u201d Rosa licked her lips hungrily, her hand teasing my nuts as my cock twitched itself back to life. I had been so focused on watching Stella strip, I didn\u2019t even notice my dick growing rock-hard. \n\n\u201cHey, no fair, Rosa! You already got a turn, I should get Anon alone this time!\u201d Stella stood in front of the couch now, her hands on her hips in a huff as she glared at her friend. This close, I could make out Stella\u2019s scent: A decidedly weeby musk of bad novelty perfume and unwashed clothes. I could also make out that Stella\u2019s cunt was leaking like a faucet down her thighs; clearly, the stego-slut was very excited at the prospect of a turn alone with me.\n\n\u201cAy, si, si, you are right Stella. It is only fair that you get a turn with An-on alone.\u201d Rosa began shuffling sideways, smacking me in the face with her massive Mexican mammaries before letting me drop off her lap and onto the couch. I could feel that cushion beneath me was soaked in Rosa\u2019s girl-cum, the sticky wet mess serving as proof of my tit-sucking abilities. \n\n\u201cGood! Now, Anon, as punishment for starting without me, I get to do whatevvvvver I want to you!\u201d Stella was already up onto the couch, squatting low over my erect cock, pussy-drool already lathering up my shaft. \u201cSooo, I choose this!\u201d And with that, Stella jammed herself down on my shaft, plunging the full length of my rod into her snatch.\n\n\u201cOooooooooh FUCK! Rosa, he\u2019s. So. Fucking. BIG!\u201d Stella began to bounce on my cock, using the back of the couch to steady herself with one hand. The other begin kneading her large lactators, pinching and rolling her hard nipples as her breathing became even more ragged. \u201cThis! Is! Definitely! Like! My! Japanese! Animes!\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, were these the animes I caught you watching, Stella? The \u2018hen-tai\u2019?\u201d Rosa watched from the floor as her friend rode my hot monkey dick, a wicked grin on her face. Rosa\u2019s hair was still matted with cum, but the luscious Latina didn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cSee? I told you it would feel better with a real hombre\u2026\u201d Rosa had started to crawl towards us on all fours, her huge tits hanging pendulous beneath her. \u201cA real sexy man, with a nice big dick to fuck us raw.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! YES! Fuck me raw, Anon! Fuck me with your hawt fuckin\u2019 cock!\u201d Stella\u2019s tongue lolled out of her mouth as she continued to cunt-fuck herself on my shaft, the wet clapping of her fat ass echoing through the apartment. I was content to lay back, resting my hands behind my head, letting Stella do all the work as she half-fell forwards, catching herself by smashing into my stomach. Fuck, that weeb could ride some dick; from the sounds of it, Stella may have had some practice of her own, however\u2026\n\nMy thoughts were interrupted by the last thing I expected: Rosa\u2019s ponderous pussy and ass, crashing down onto my face. My mouth is suddenly filled with the rank smell of horny dino pussy, Rosa\u2019s bush amplifying the heady scent. As the sweet, salty taste of Rosa filled my mouth, I could hear a muffled moan from Stella, Rosa\u2019s ass cheeks large enough to cover my ears.\n\n\u201cAww! No! Fair! Rosa! This was *ah!* my turn! Get your own *fuck!* seat!\u201d Stella\u2019s riding had slowed down a bit as she argued, but by no means did the insatiable green gooner stop. Instead, Stella took to twisting and grinding on my dick, squeezing her pussy walls around me as she did so. My pleasuable moans were stifled by the soaking cunt plastered to my mouth. Where the fuck did she learn to do that?!\n\n\u201cAy, I\u2019m not cheating, Stella! You hand An-on\u2019s dick, and I have his face. An-on, you had better start down there, because I am no getting off until you get me off!\u201d \n\nI could almost laugh at the terrible pun, had my nose not been buried deep in Rosa\u2019s ass. So, she wanted another turn then? Well, two could play at that game\u2026\n\nA sharp gasp escaped Rosa\u2019s lips as I buried my tongue as deep as it could go into her waiting snatch, plunging Rosa\u2019s plump pussyfolds with every inch I could manage. Coincidentally, Stella was accomplishing much the same feat, instead utilizing my rock-hard shaft to plug up her hungry snatch. The three of us quickly settled into a rhythm: Stella bouncing opposite in time to my own thrusts into Rosa\u2019s pussy, each of us moaning with reckless abandon. Soon, the room echoed with the screams of the two women as they used my body for their own pleasure, the loud clapping of Stella\u2019s ass providing a pleasant baseline to the music of our carnal sex orgy. Despite my efforts to the contrary, I could feel my balls begin to clench, a telltale sign that my orgasm was about to arrive. \n\nWhich was for the best, really, because Rosa was literally smothering me with her ass. \n\nI knew my only hope for survival was to get Rosa off as quickly as possible. Leaving Stella to ride the cock carousel, I re-focused my efforts on Rosa\u2019s sopping wet snatch, pulling out all the stops: I started flicking her clit with my tongue, teasing the sensitive bud before sucking it repeatedly into my mouth, all the while driving my tongue deeper into her folds. Rosa responded by screaming out in Spanish, clenching my head between her thighs as she too leaned her hands on my chest. I can hear Stella getting close as well, given that her high-pitched wails had begun sounding just like the girls in MY Japanese animes (if you catch my drift). It was shame that they sounded like they were on the other end of a long tunnel; I wouldn\u2019t enjoyed bringing two women to orgasm had my brain not been cut off from it\u2019s precious oxygen. But hey: Two hot, sexy women using my body like a sex-toy? There were worse ways to die, I suppose.\n\nOnly, Stella did something just then that saved my life.\n\n\u201cOh FUCK! Rosa, kiss me! Quick, nownownownowNOW!\u201d Without waiting for a response, I could feel Stella\u2019s weight shift on my stomach, no doubt her hand pulling her Latina-love in for a kiss. Rosa\u2019s Spanish shrieking was cut off momentarily, as was Stella\u2019s would-be JAV audition. Stella must be a damn good kisser, because the combination of what I was doing below and what she was doing above was enough to set Rosa off. Rosa\u2019s legs and pussy convulsed on top of me, allowing me to gulp some precious air before going back under, Rosa\u2019s muffled moans matched my own as I started blasted jizz deep inside Stella\u2019s wet snatch. Stella quickly joined us in our orgasm orgy, her body twitching on top of me as my sperm flooded her waiting womb (probably). Still I continued to kiss and tongue-fuck Rosa\u2019s cunt, ensuring her orgasm was strung-out as long as my own as Stella continued to bounce up and down, skewering herself as deep as she could each time. \n\nI swear, if Stella was doing the anime \u201cV\u201d signs with her hands, and I missed that\u2026\n\nEventually, the two women sagged on top of me, panting heavily as their legs twitched uselessly. I managed to roll out from underneath them, ignoring Stella\u2019s feeble protests as I slid out of her thoroughly-fucked pussy with a wet *plop*. Landing on my back, I could see the two of them sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, backs against the back of the couch, panting heavily as they attempted to recover their senses. Stella\u2019s hand was still entwined with Rosa\u2019s, their fingers interlinked as the two women\u2019s eyes rolled back to the front of their heads. \n\n\u201cTime for both of us, Anon\u201d, they

It had come down to this: the finals of the Yu-Di-No tournament, a monumental battle of cards that shook Valcaldera to its very core. Friendships were tested and found wanting, anime cliches were uttered and discovered that they didn\u2019t really sound that great in English, and the blood of a thousand paper-cuts from dramatic top-decking had been spilled. But what was the prize that these two titans of the tournament fought for, a prize that threated the very foundation of their friendship? One. Million. Dino-nuggies.\n\n\u201cGo, Inverted High-Priestesses, attack!\u201d Stella roared, nearly assured her victory. Veins stood out on her body like thick cords, distorting her normal passive face into a rictus grimace mad with power. Anon could only shake his head, for the onetime friend he now faced wasn\u2019t even referencing the correct character. Her monster, a larger-than-life stylized image of herself, a shimmer hologram towering above the duelists, raised its arms in attack, the cycles of the moon beginning to rotate faster and faster around its blindfolded head. Energy crackled, bringing a smell of ozone to the arena, which didn\u2019t really make sense because it was a hologram, but that did little to dissuade Anon. Standing his ground, his expressionless face a vision of determination, Anon knew he had one more trick up his sleeve.\n\n\u2018You won\u2019t defeat me, Stella,\u2019 Anon thought, his eyes narrowing. \u2018I always fight for those who believe! For my friends! For myself! And for my QT-Ptero Gee Eff!\u2019 He was too determined to notice Fang, standing around the arena with the rest of the gang, facepalming hard at Anon\u2019s autistic mumbling. \u2018Stella, I will defeat you. As a rival who walked the road of weebdom with me, and as a friend!\u2019\n\n\u201cUltimateo Burstooooooooooo!\u201d Throwing her hands out, Stella ordered her final attack, choosing to deliver this line in broken Engrish for dramatic effect. The Inverted High-Priestess\u2019 attack rocketed forth, the eight phases of the moon cascading towards Anon in shimmer streaks of golden light.\n\n\u201cReverse card, open! Mathematician\u2019s Textbook!\u201d Revealing a card illustrated with the collector\u2019s edition art-book of Saturnia slipped between the pages of an enormously heavy textbook, Anon\u2019s hoped to save his own monster, from Stella\u2019s would-be fatal attack.\n\n\u201cFutile! I activate Shitpost Absorption!\u201d Stella\u2019s grin was that of total triumph as she dramatically revealed her spell card, accidently dropping it as she held it between the tips of her fingers. Undeterred, Stella quickly bent over to pick the card up, resuming her monologue. \u201cThe moment your monster\u2019s Post Count goes up, those posts are absorbed into my monster\u2019s Post count, bumping it!\u201d\n\n\u201cNani?!\u201d Anon cried, his eyes wide with shock. \u2018The High-Priestess\u2019 Post Count went up another 500 posts!\u2019 \n\n\u201cHahahaha! Shatter to pieces along with your Trigger Paladin and your lover\u2019s card, Amber-Eyes, Anon!\u201d So confident was Stella in her victory that she paid no heed to Trish\u2019s distraught cries over her racial slur. Indeed, the Inverted High-Priestess\u2019 attack seemed sure to seal the duel, moving inexorably but also incredible slowly towards Anon\u2019s side of the board. \n\n\u201cThe end\u2026\u201d Sage mumbled to themself, hidden from view and totally unknown to everyone else despite being in the teaser-trailer for this episode.\n\n\u201c\u00a1Ella lo hizo!\u201d Rosa cheered, bounding up and down on Stella\u2019s side of the arena in a way that made all men within a fifty-yard radius subconsciously wipe the sweat from their brow.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026?! Annnnoooooon!\u201d Fang cried, running into the arena despite just having been there, as the attack was about to land. \n\n\u201cI won\u2026\u201d Her words barely audible over the totally unnecessarily loud attack, Stella stood wide-eyed, almost surprised she was about to accomplish her goal. \u201cI was sure he would have one more\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure!\u201d \n\nWell, sorry Stella, you tried.\n\n\u201cStella\u2026 You can pile on the cliches, but it\u2019s weeb!!\u201d Thrusting his finger decisively at his opponent, Anon seem undeterred that he was about to be eliminated from the Yu-Di-No tournament. \n\n\u201cWhat was that?!\u201d Stella\u2019s eyes were even wider now, her unbelievably racist space-buns beginning to unravel.\n\n\u201cDid you really think you would win, bearing a burden of anime and cliches?!\u201d Anon retorted, adjusting the Golden Puzzle RAYmba hung around his neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Stella waved her arm dismissively, as if to cut Anon\u2019s words out of the air. \u201cThere\u2019s no way your Monster could defeat the Inverted High-Priestess!\u201d \n\n\u201cThen I\u2019m going to show you\u2026the last attack that will grant my victory! Reverse card, open!\u201d\n\nReed scratched his head, leaning in to whisper to the still-indignant Trish. \u201cI\u2019m confused, didn\u2019t he already play the Reverse card?\u201d\n\n\u201cFusion Cancel!\u201d Anon, seemingly ignorant of anything other than the duel, revealed his OTHER amazingly conveniently-played-for-this-exact-situation card that he hoped would save his monster. \n\n\u2018Fusion Cancel?\u2019 Stella\u2019s thoughts were filled with sputtering rage, her eyes bloodshot.\n\n\u201cIt splits up one Fusion Monster on the field and negates their attack for the turn!\u201d Continuing to narrate his card\u2019s own actions despite both participants seemingly understanding the rules of the very game they played, Anon narrowed his eyes dramatically.\n\n\u2018Did he know I was going to play the Inverted High-Priestess\u2026?!\u2019 Stella had not said anything for several minutes, and Rosa was beginning to worry. The Fusion Cancel card began to take effect, the hologram of Stella\u2019s Inverted High-Priestess beginning to spasm violently as it was consumed with white light. \u2018My Inverted High-Priestess\u2026is splitting apart!\u2019 Finally, the deed was done, as the Inverted High-Priestess split into its component parts with a very poorly done glass-shattering effect. Soon, only the High-Priestess, looking not quite-like the Inverted High-Priestess but close enough to not warrant describing again, and a fanciful picture of Naomi in a white robe representing the Inverted Temperance remained. \n\n\u201cThere are now two more Tarot-Types on the field! Increasing Trigger Paladin\u2019s Post Count!\u201d The stoic black warrior standing in front of Anon grew in power, gaining an extra horn on his crest. Reed had to hold back Trish at this point, the diminutive purple dino attempting to rush the arena in anger. \u201cAnd because the fusion of Inverted Empress was canceled, your turn comes to an end!\u201d\n\n\u201cNani\u2026?!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Turn!\u201d Anon didn\u2019t let Stella continue, knowing that if she started talking in Japanese she would never stop. \u201cDraw-o!\u201d Ripping the card off the top of his deck like a jackass and nearly causing all his cards to spill to the ground, Anon didn\u2019t even bother to look at it before he started running his mouth off. \u201cStella! This card will tear apart the weebiness that controls your heart! I active a Magic Card from my hand!\u201d Anon inserted the newly drawn card into his duel-deck, the hunk of plastic and cardboard he had made himself somehow. \u201cDiffusion Stair Fall!\u201d The hologram version of the card appeared next to him, depicting a human tumbling down a large flight of stairs. \n\n\u2018Diffusion Stair Fall!\u2019 Stella mumbled in her head, doing her best impression of a Snoot-al Gear Solid character.\n\n\u201cBy paying 1000 of my Post Number, I can direct my Paladin\u2019s attack order to cover every monster on your side of the field! That means Trigger Paladin can attack all three Tarot-Eyes at the same time!\u201d\n\n\u2018Each of the Tarot-Eyes has only a 3000 Post Count\u2026! And his Trigger Paladin has over nine-thousand!\u2019 \n\n\u201cTrigger Paladin, attack!\u201d It was taking Reed and Naser to hold back Trish at this point, but neither duelist seemed to care: Their eyes were fixed on Anon\u2019s monster as it raised its bass on high, the body of the might guitar beginning to generate a halo of energy. \n\n\u2018Stella\u2026 You won\u2019t achieve true victory with such a clich\u00e9 plot line!\u2019 Somehow, Anon\u2019s clothes were fluttering as if in a strong breeze, despite the authorly previously asserting that the monsters were just holograms.\n\n\u201cBeyond Math! Anger Trigger Warning!!\u201d The Paladin\u2019s bass began sending waves of searing energy cascading across the arena, slicing neatly through each of Stella\u2019s monsters. One by one they fell, dissipating into nothingness even as their owner\u2019s Poster Number began tumbling down to zero. Rosa fell to her knees, tears forming in her eyes as she was forced to watch her friend get Deus Ex Machina\u2019d into a loss. Standing next to Anon\u2019s friends, Sage laughed, still seemingly escaping notice despite being right fucking next to them. Stella\u2019s face fell, her tail coiling around her leg as at long last, her thread was auto-saged.\n\n\u2018Stella. You lost to me now\u2026 But you still have to defeat your own weebiness!\u2019\n\nThe only response was the sound of the collective facepalming at Anon\u2019s mumbling.","encoded":false,"Title":"Anon

Bitch Stella Classic.txt"],"text":"Title: Bad Bitch Stella Classic\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Naser, Reed, Naomi, Rosa, Stella and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Examanon\nSummary: Stella gets Anon to watch anime with her. Sexy shenanigans happen?\n\n\n[Anon]\n\"Remind me again why I'm here?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Haha, to watch the new pilot of SAO with me of course!\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Yeah, so, WHY am I here?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Oh come on, it can't be that bad. I know season two was kinda weak, but this is gonna be infinitely better cause...\"\n\nShe drones on after that, but I'm not really listening till she elbows me in the side.\n\n[Stella]\n\"...plus you have me to yourself. Isn't that cool?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Uh-huh\"\n\nWe're just outside her room in the Volcano High dorms. I didn't even know there were dorms.\n\nShe's sharing a room with Rosa, they've told me. I assume that's how they got to be friends to begin with, because I can hardly imagine any other scenario in which anyone would willingly befriend Stella.\n\nI mean, she's okay but her random weird stuff is just... Weird. Like with the cards.\n\nIf only she had normal interests she'd be like an 8\/10 qt3.14. Or if she kept quiet.\n\nShe opens the door and ushers me inside. For some reason I was expecting the walls to be covered with pink plush carpeting, a rug and bedsheets to go with it. With pink everything, really.\n\nThe room looks like just another dorm room though. Cupboards, a bunk bed, two desks, and a mini fridge. There are some school supplies and clothes thrown around.\n\nThe only out of ordinary thing are the posters. Or to be more specific, the absence of them. Almost the entire wall is covered with dots and lines, some of which I recognize as constellations.\n\nWhat I guess to be moon cycles is also up there right next to the bed.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Sorry, I didn't really have the time to clean up.\"\n\nShe's blushing as she says it. Kinda cute.\n\nWithout much ceremony, Stella picks up a laptop from one of the desks, and puts it on the top bunk.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Alright Anon, get up! I'll be back in a sec.\"\n\nShe disappears behind a door that I didn't even notice was there, the drawings on it blending in with the wall too much.\n\nSo um. She wants me to...\n\nUhhhhhh...\n\nI was under the impression that we were going to like, sit in chairs? Maybe a big sofa.\n\nBut not share a bed. A single bed, mind you.\n\nUgh, how am I going to explain this to Fang?\n\n...\n\nFine.\n\nI climb the ladder and sit upon the edge, my legs dangling down.\n\nThere are some plushies by her pillow. One of them could be a rabbit, but the others are various nondescript figures that I can't place.\n\nHer bed smells nice.\n\nTrue to her word, Stella returns just a few moments later.\n\nWait. Oh my fucking god.\n\nIs she fucking cosplaying?\n\nIn place of her usual shirt and short jeans attire she's donned a weirdly - or should I say tactically - cut green-white leotard kind of deal, a white scarf, and a blue wig.\n\nEven with my limited knowledge, I can tell that she's supposed to be the new heroine from the season three trailers. Whatshername.\n\nShe's even got the tiddy for it.\n\nThe only thing breaking the image is that spindly leg grab with her tail Stella often does.\n\n[Stella]\n\"W-well, how is it?\"\n\nThere's that blush again.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Umm, nice?\"\n\nI don't know what kind of answer she was expecting, but she seems content with \"nice\".\n\nShe climbs up halfway, and motions for me to lay properly on the bed instead of sideways.\n\nOh no, she seriously wants to do it like that? Being pressed shoulder to shoulder on this narrow fucking bed?\n\nNot to mention other extremities...\n\nFine. She won that bet after all.\n\nUgh, I'll never live this down.\n\nI shuffle my body around, careful not to knock Stella off the ladder, and lay on my stomach as close to the wall as I can get.\n\nShe gets up next to me, and puts her laptop on the pillow.\n\nI want to point out that this way the poor machine will overheat and get full of dust and shit, but I don't really care that much. I just want to get this thing over with.\n\nOur bodies unavoidably press together as Stella gets comfortable. With her suit cut as it is, I'm very sure that her butt touches me multiple times.\n\nHow is this not bothering her? I'm sure that my face is plain red right about now.\n\nThank fuck I'm laying dick down and don't have to be concerned about Stella noticing my hard-on.\n\nAfter a few minutes of browsing we find the stream that she wants to watch. Her girlish excitement is kinda cute, I guess.\n\nShe's constantly babbling on something about this or that idol or whatever, who is apparently the hostess.\n\nEventually the intro starts up, and I get deafened by a shrieking Stella.\n\n[Stella]\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\nShe grabs one of her bigger plushies, and muffles her screams.\n\nNot for long.\n\nAs soon as the actual opening comes on, she sings along in a very, very broken Wapanese.\n\nAlmost as if she forgot that I was there.\n\nI try to be nice and gulp down the cringefest about to come on. Truth be told, her out of bounds enthusiasm moves some long forgotten part of me.\n\nWhen was the last time I browsed headlines without looking for the next tortanic?\n\nI push the existential dread aside and return my attention to the show.\n\nThe opening has ended, and now we are following some generic looking anime goons. It really isn't anything special, but Stella doesn't seem to care.\n\nHer legs are up in a crossed position to stop them from running an invisible treadmill, and her tail is non-stop thrashing around.\n\nEvery now and again it wraps around one of her legs, but often she mistakes my leg for hers.\n\nThe closeness and touchiness of this girl quickly push my alarms to maximum level, and I can't even concentrate on the episode.\n\nInstead I'm wiping sweat off my brow, and trying not to pay attention to her ass jiggle as she jumps every time something quote un-quote exciting happens.\n\nUnwelcome thoughts crowd my mind, like \"Does Stella even have a boyfriend?\" and \"Oh fuck I can't tell Fang about any of this.\".\n\nThe episode and stream eventually end, and she once again screams into the plushie.\n\nThere's a cliffhanger that I don't really care about, but Stella is on edge.\n\n[Stella]\n\"OmigoshAnonwasn'tthatthecoolestthingyoueversaw?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Okay.\"\n\nI have no idea what the fuck she just said.\n\nShe turns onto her back, staring wistfully up at the ceiling.\n\nOne more scream, and it looks like she's composed herself enough to actually speak coherently.\n\n[Stella]\n\"That was pretty cool, right?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Don't you think that Dinon was cool? She's so brave!\"\n\nI have to carefully think about what I say here. Even though it's Stella we're talking about, I don't want to take these giddy feels away from her.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Y-yeah, it wasn't that bad.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Can I go now?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Aww, you really didn't like it then? But it was so AAAAAAH! PEW PEW\"\n\nShe's even doing the finger guns, in my face of course.\n\n[Anon]\n\"It um... It's just not to my taste?\"\n\n...\n\nShe goes silent after that, tugging on her sticky leotard awkwardly.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Will you watch the next episode with me?\"\n\nI'm so flabbergasted that it takes me quite a few seconds to come up with a reply. Both because of the question itself, and her tender voice as she asks it.\n\nNot like I in any shape, way, or form benefitted her experience. I mean, she just watched the episode like normal. I didn't even need to be here.\n\nIt hits me that she probably has no one to watch anime with, despite it being a huge part of her life.\n\nMaybe she gets Rosa to do it every now and again, but it's not like Rosa would care about this stuff.\n\n[Anon]\n\"This is pretty important to you, right?\"\n\nShe blushes, hiding her face with the plushie till I can barely look into her eyes.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI will regret this. I will SO regret this.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Okay.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Really, you would?\"\n\nShe muffles another scream, obviously excited.\n\n[Anon]\n\"But umm, I really have to go now. I uh, promised Fang that uhhhhh...\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Yeah, yeah, okay. I gotta study anyway.\"\n\nI wait for a second or two for her to get off the bed, but it's apparent that she won't. She's just looking at me expectantly.\n\nFine.\n\nI try to climb over her, touching her as little as I can.\n\nDontlookathertits.\n\nOnce again, I feel her tail wrap around one of my legs and I stop dead in my tracks. Practically doing a handstand above her.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Uhh, Stel--\"\n\nShe cuts me off.\n\nWith.\n\nA.\n\nFucking.\n\nKiss.\n\nI'm frozen on the spot, the best I can manage is not letting my hands give away as she grabs onto the collar of my jacket.\n\nIn that moment, I'm unnaturally aware of the heat and scent of her body, how her tail tightens around my muscles. Even the ever so faint strawberry flavor of her lipstick.\n\nIt takes all of my willpower not to return the kiss. I fact, I might even fail a bit in this regard.\n\nSadly-- I MEAN THANKFULLY, it doesn't last long, Stella withdraws with one last - actually painful - love bite into my lower lip.\n\nShe retreats behind the plushie till once again only her eyes are visible. At the same time, her tail lets go of me.\n\n[Stella]\n\"You should leave now, Anon.\"\n\nBitch what the fuck.\n\nYeah, I will be leaving.\n\nI quite literally spin-fall off the bed akin to my morning ritual, dashing out the fucking door as soon as my feet land on the ground.\n\n* * *\n\nMy head is spinning as I exit the building.\n\nWhat the fuck just happened.\n\nI light one of the smokes that Fang lent me, taking a long drag.\n\nI'm starting to believe that the ONLY reason Stella wanted me here today was to pull this stunt.\n\nFucking hell.\n\nNow I seriously can't tell Fang about any of this.\n\nI notice residue of Stella's lipstick on the filter.\n\nShitfuck.\n\nWiping my mouth reveals that not only am I throughoutly covered with it, but that her love bite actually drew blood.\n\nWell here's the conversation: \"Oh yeah hey Fang, nah don't worry about it I just headbutted the sidewalk haha!\"\n\nRaptor Jesus give me strength...\n\nI think about going back in there and force Stella to explain. Although, what is there for her to explain?\n\nAn affair is pretty fucking straightforward.\n\nThe worst part is that I don't exactly hate Stella for this.\n\nI look down at my hand, smeared with lipstick and my own blood.\n\nSlowly I lift it up to my mouth, and lick it.\n\nMaybe I'm imagining it, but there seems to be a slight strawberry flavor to it.\n\n...\n\nI shake my head, trying to get these damn thoughts out of it. I wipe my face again and finish the cigarette.\n\nFucking Stella.\n\n* * *\n\nThe rest of the evening goes by with me trying to figure out how to explain this to Fang, but to no avail. I seriously doubt that I'll be able to hold a poker face next time I see Stella.\n\nTo top it all off, there's a part of me that keeps going back to that kiss, and how I felt seeing Stella be genuinely excited for her shitty anime.\n\nThere's no denying that I've enjoyed both of these feelings and the excitement that comes with like, secret love in the woods.\n\nI heat up some leftover food, but can't be bothered to really take a bite.\n\nAfter a quick shower I go straight to bed, skipping the nightly round of shitposting.\n\nI toss and turn for a long time, unable to get the image of Stella in that tight suit out of my head.\n\nSo much so, that I end up messaging her about it. It's about midnight, but she might be up.\n\nMaybe if I don't bring up the kiss she won't either?\n\nWait, will she think that I'm encouraging this shit if I message her?\n\n...and ask for nudes?\n\nNnnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\n\nYou're right boner, what's the worst that could happen?\n\n[Anon]\n\"hey u sleeping\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"r u still wearing the thing\"\n\nPunctuation is for retards.\n\nA minute or so later she replies.\n\n[Stella]\n\"hi Anon!!! <3\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"yeh, y?\"\n\nUhhhh...\n\nA fucking heart right out the door. I should stop.\n\nI type in \"send a pic\", but then erase it without sending.\n\nThen I do the same with \"send nudes\", \"send feet\", and \"bobs and vagene\".\n\nI ALMOST do fucking send \"bitch lasagna\" by accident.\n\nAfter that I just start typing in and deleting random letters so that she thinks I'm actually writing a message.\n\nWhat am I even doing? This is so wrong. I have a girlfriend for fucks sake.\n\nBut then again, my dick knows exactly what it is I want. Plus it's kind of adorkable that she still has it on.\n\nFuck me here it goes.\n\n[Anon]\n\"send a pic?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"!!!\"\n\nOh no.\n\nI fucked up.\n\nDid I fuck up?\n\nYes.\n\nNo.\n\nMaybe.\n\nI don't know.\n\nCould you repeat the question?\n\nNa nana na naan naanaaa...\n\nI start zoning out, but then she really does send a picture.\n\nIt's dark - probably didn't want to alert Rosa -, but I can definitely make out two shapely legs and a tummy, for reals still in the leotard. She's in bed too.\n\nOne of her legs has her tail curled up on it. Wouldn't be Stella if it wasn't.\n\nI find myself smiling like an idiot, but horny and excited as well.\n\n[Anon]\n\"cute\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"more?\"\n\nThis won't end well, but I can't stop now.\n\n[Stella]\n\"okie gimme a sec :$\"\n\nIt actually takes her so long to send the next message that I almost fall asleep.\n\nIt's another pic, in a lit room this time. The flooring would suggest the bathroom.\n\nThe picture is of one of her hands.\n\nI don't get it, until I notice some opaque slimy goop on the end of her fingers.\n\n[Stella]\n\"sowwie daddy, had a little accident <3\"\n\nOh fuck. Oh god. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.\n\nWait that's hot as fuck.\n\nBUT OH NO\n\nDid she just fucking seriously...?\n\nI mean, I was jerking it a little to the other pic but...\n\nWell anon that's it, you're a chad now.\n\nBut this is so fucked up.\n\nMaybe... S-should I send an image back?\n\nNo, a dick pic might be over the line. It's been like, PG-13 so far.\n\n[Anon]\n\"hawt\"\n\nShe sends another pic not long after. It would be of her boobs, but it's all blurry. Like she fell while taking it.\n\nHer next message explains it all.\n\n[Stella]\n\"fuk i woke rosa\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"sry bye <3\"\n\nI'm mortified at the prospect of Rosa finding out about this. I hope Stella can explain it somehow. Or at the very least get the shoe-to-the-face treatment for being a slut and not for...\n\nFor um...\n\nSending nudes to a guy with a girlfriend?\n\nDamn why did I do this?\n\nI'm immediately filled with shame and guilt, eclipsing the horniness from before.\n\nThere is NO WAY I'll be able to explain this shit to Fang anymore. No. She can't know about ANY of this.\n\n...\n\nDick still in hand, I mutely jerk off to the pics Stella sent, and go the fuck to sleep.\n\n* * *\n\nBEEP BEEP BEEP\n\nMy Monday morning alarm pierces the veil of my feverish dreams, being chased by a shotgun wielding Fang.\n\n6 AM.\n\nI feel like shit, and I know that I deserve it.\n\nThe food from yesterday is still on the table. I poke at it a little, but can't get myself to force down a single piece.\n\nI've done something unforgivable.\n\nAnd the worst part? That it's not even over. Oh no.\n\nToday my newest dark secret might be revealed for all the world to know.\n\nBy Rosa? By Stella? Hell, even by me if I slip up.\n\nI can't rationalize why I even did it, besides getting a kick out of it. I love Fang.\n\nI flip through my messages, hoping that it'll turn out to be a dream.\n\nBut no, the entire conversation is there, clear as day.\n\nThis is a nightmare.\n\nI can't even ask anyone for advice...\n\nWell... Maybe I could ask Reed? He's a bro so maybe he'll keep it a secret. Then again, he's Fang's friend first. He might just cut ties with me and tell her.\n\nAnd really, I'd totally deserve it.\n\nStill, it's the best plan I can come up with. That and trying to find Stella alone somewhere, and clear up the situation with her.\n\nIt might be fixable. I'll just have to apologize to Fang, and HOPE that she will understand.\n\n* * *\n\nFortunately Trish is absent today, so I can have a talk with Reed alone during math, our first class of the week.\n\nAlso fortunately I haven't yet run into Fang. Or Stella. Or Rosa.\n\nMy luck can only hold on for so long though, and Reed immediately gets suspicious of my fidgeting around.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Something up, bro?\"\n\n...\n\n[Anon]\n\"Reed um, can you keep a secret?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Hells yeah man, what's up?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Even if it's something really fucked up?\"\n\nHe gets serious all of a sudden.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nI contemplate backing off or lying. But I know Reed enough that he won't have it, not after this intro.\n\n[Anon]\n\"I seriously fucked up man. Like, really-really seriously fucked up. And I don't know what to do.\"\n\nHe expects me to continue.\n\nI don't even know where to begin...\n\n[Anon]\n\"You know Stella won that bet the other day and got me to watch some shit with her?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Uh-huh\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"So we were alone in her room, and she got me onto her bed and--\"\n\nHis eyes widen.\n\n[Reed]\n\"You did not!\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"No. NO! It uh...\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"After the episode she like, kissed me out of fucking nowhere! I bolted the fuck away but...\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"But...\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"But?\"\n\nI can't do it. Jesus Reed, you would never talk to me if you knew...\n\nI take a look around, thankfully nobody is paying us any attention.\n\nI open my mouth to formulate the words, but they're stuck in my throat.\n\n[Anon]\n\"I-- then-- at night--\"\n\nTo my surprise, Reed's troubled face turns to a grin. Although he drops it quickly.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Dude, you did the jenkem to the kiss?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Yeah that's kinda fucked up but like... You just gotta let her down, you know like--\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"It was pictures. She sent pictures. I asked and she sent them.\"\n\nThat shuts Reed right the fuck up.\n\nYeah.\n\n[Reed]\n\"...you serious?\"\n\nMy silence is answer enough.\n\nReed slumps back into his chair. He looks like someone that refuses to believe what he just heard.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Man, that's fucked up. What are you going to do?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Fang doesn't know jack, right?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"She doesn't. Not yet.\"\n\nHe just nods.\n\n[Anon]\n\"I don't know what to do man. I figured that I'll talk to Stella today and get her to back off, but I don't know how to handle the Fang situation.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Help me out here man, please!\"\n\nAt that exact moment, my phone buzzes.\n\nIt's a message from Stella.\n\nI show the notification to Reed for dramatic effect, and he looks back at me with a very fucking intense look.\n\n[Reed]\n\"I can't, Anon. I'll keep this a secret, but Fang is my friend and I won't lie to her.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"I'll hold her off for today so you can handle Stella. But you better fucking explain it to her after.\"\n\nHe sighs, and continues in a softer tone.\n\n[Reed]\n\"You fucked up. Fang might be willing to look the other way, cause you seriously seem like you know that it's fucked. And that you were the one to fuck it into the ground.\"\n\n...\n\nThat's more than I could have hoped for. Thank you based god Reedman.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Thanks dude. I owe you a big one.\"\n\nHe holds his hand up at that.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Nah. You make it up to Fang and we're square, aight? But this is a one time thing, you better believe it.\"\n\nI'm about to respond when the bell goes off. Reed immediately gets up, and leaves me with a you-so-do-not-want-to-fuck-this-up stare.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nI remain in my seat almost throughout the entire period, minimizing the risk of running into Fang.\n\nRight, I should check the message from Stella. Maybe she feels guilty too. Maybe she's realized that this is wrong.\n\n[Stella]\n\"i got called a bad girl Anon\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"am i a bad girl? <3 <3\"\n\nMy mind goes blank, and essentially I do the blinkingguy.gif motion.\n\nNo fuck this. This is my chance. Reed should take care of Fang, so I just need to get to Stella before this all goes belly up.\n\n[Anon]\n\"lunch. roof.\"\n\nThe bell rings again as I type, so I shut the phone and sprint to the next class.\n\nWhich is music, oh no.\n\nI can feel my phone buzz, probably Stella sending her reply.\n\nBy the time I get there, the class has already started.\n\nI look around nervously, scanning the room for Fang.\n\n[Mr. Jingo]\n\"I'm afraid your partner won't be back for a while.\"\n\n[Mr. Jingo]\n\"They're helping Reed with something-something school mascot something-something.\"\n\nTHANK FUCK\n\n[Anon]\n\"O-okay.\"\n\nI'm handed an assignment sheet, and left to my own devices. Really, I don't care one bit.\n\nAs soon as the teacher is back to whatever the fuck he's doing I take my phone out to check the message from Stella.\n\nThere's a couple from Fang too.\n\n[Fang]\n\"soz ditching w\/ reed\"\n\n[Fang]\n\"ill help u after school :V\"\n\nWow. If I wasn't yet feeling shitty, that sure did it.\n\nOkay, let's check the other one.\n\n[Stella]\n\"okie <3\"\n\nPlus there's a closeup of her mouth, doing a blowjob gesture with her hand.\n\nThis fucking bitch.\n\n...\n\nStill hot tho.\n\n* * *\n\nI get onto the roof with conflicted feelings.\n\nWould it be that bad to keep Stella around? That is, if we can keep it a secret? Looks like that's her agenda here.\n\nIf she wanted me and Fang to break up, she's got more than enough leverage on me.\n\nLike okay this is a major fucking red flag, but it's not like I'm hurting Fang...\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure that I'd be able to face myself in the mirror ever again. Fang would surely know that something's up, and then it would be only a matter of time till she figures it out.\n\nPlus there's Reed, who would never let me get away with it.\n\nLet's stick with the original plan.\n\nScanning the surroundings I conclude that I'm alone on the roof. No messages from Stella, so I'm assuming she's on her way.\n\nI assume correctly. In only a minute or two she makes her appearance.\n\nShe's wearing her usual shirt and shorts combo.\n\nPart of me is thankful for that. Makes this all the more normal. Normal-er.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Hey, Anon!\"\n\nI don't respond, but instead grab her by her forearm and forcefully drag her behind the little shed Fang preened on top of that one time.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Geez! Okay!\"\n\nShe janks her arm back. Seems like she's not really sure what to expect.\n\nI take a deep breath. Let's do this.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Stella, this can't continue.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I have a girlfriend, who you know by the way.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I shouldn't have led you on last night either, so I am sorry, okay?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"But please, let's not go any further than this.\"\n\nI can't bring myself to keep eye contact.\n\nThere's total silence for a while.\n\nShe steps closer, causing me to back into the wall.\n\n[Stella]\n\"No further, so... We should keep things as they are?\"\n\nShe grabs onto my belt with both hands, pulling her body close to mine.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Cause I really am your bad bitch now, Anon...\"\n\nI'm speechless.\n\nI want to push her away too, yet I can't find the strength to lift a single finger.\n\n[Anon]\n\"That's not what--\"\n\nI'm cut off by the creaking of the door.\n\nOh no.\n\n[????]\n\"Are you sure this is okay?\"\n\n[????]\n\"Isn't the roof like, off-limits?\"\n\n...is that fucking Naser?\n\n[????]\n\"It'll be fine.\"\n\nYep, and that's Naomi. I could never forget her annoying ass voice.\n\n[Naser]\n\"Shit fine, let's do this...\"\n\nOh god, what are they doing?\n\nA quick check at Stella tells me that she's just as frozen as I am.\n\nI can hear clothes shuffling, and a belt being undone.\n\nNo.\n\nOh god please, please no.\n\nNooooooooooooooooo!\n\nThe unmistakable noise of a blowjob hits my ears.\n\nThis can't be real. I've fainted, and this is just a dream, right? Right?\n\nThe lewd sounds continue for a good minute, and it doesn't sound like they'll be done soon either.\n\nTo my horror, Stella starts whispering into my ear.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Aww Anon, maybe we should do something too?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"No shut the fuck up!\"\n\nMy voice is merely a panicked whisper.\n\nThere are now disturbing fucking throat sounds coming from the other side of the shed.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Mmmm, can you hear how hard Naser is giving it to her? So hot, right?\"\n\nShe's unzipping my pants as she says it, reaching for my dick.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Make me.\"\n\nStella is no longer whispering, getting down on her knees. She's successfully released my dick from my boxer, and is now waiting with an open mouth for me to...\n\nTo...\n\n[Naomi]\n\"Fuck, did you hear that?\"\n\n[Naser]\n\"NahIdidn'thearanything.\"\n\nI can see Stella getting impatient, taking a breath to say something again.\n\nFUCK\n\nI grab the back of her head and force her to take it all. Bitch wants silent, I give her silent. Yeah, talk with a throat full of cock.\n\nShe's surprised, but to her credit she doesn't gag one bit.\n\nI keep her like that, her short snout pressed up against my stomach.\n\nMy whole body is shaking in panic, yet I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel great. With her unable to move her head, instead I can feel her tongue exploring my length.\n\nFrom the other side of the shed the noises have already resumed. Naser really is giving it to Naomi.\n\nBy the sounds of it she's taking it like a champ too.\n\n[Naser]\n\"Ffffuucckkk!\"\n\nI guess that's him finishing. Truth be told, I'm not that far behind.\n\nEven in her current situation, Stella is doing all she can to tip me over. Fucking silently too, thank fuck.\n\nSomewhere inside the building a bell rings, and the other couple quickly leaves.\n\nI'm so relieved that I immediately let go of Stella's hair.\n\nBut she doesn't budge one bit and keeps going.\n\nOh no.\n\nAm I going to...? Will she seriously make me...?\n\nThere's no way I can get away with the wall behind me. D-do I even want to?\n\nI look down at Stella, who's staring right back up at me.\n\nThere are tears running down her blushed cheeks, my dick still embedded deep in her throat. Nothing but the bulge on the outside can be seen of it, mids the strands of saliva almost reaching down to the floor.\n\nFuck.\n\nI grab into her hair, and start to awkwardly move my hips back and forth. Once again, she takes the impromptu facefuck like a pro.\n\nJust who is this girl?\n\nSoon I reach the point of no return. With one last shove, I force the entire thing down into her throat again.\n\nAnd there I go.\n\nStella closes her eyes, taking the load with loud gulping sounds.\n\nAfterwards she backs off, letting my dick pop from her mouth with a lewd slurping sound.\n\nUsing her shirt she cleans up the drool the best she can, humming to herself contently.\n\nMeanwhile, my heart has practically stopped.\n\nWith the climax over, shame and helplessness wash over me double-fold.\n\nMy legs give away, and I slide down beside the wall. Thankfully Stella doesn't cuddle up to me, she keeps her distance kneeling there.\n\nMaybe realizing how far she went, or maybe for seeing how miserable she's made me.\n\nI almost fucking choke up on the spot.\n\nThat's it, my life is fucking over.\n\nU DUN IT NAO ANO MOU\n\nI stay there, legs splayed and softening dick still out.\n\n...\n\n[Stella]\n\"Are you alright, Anon?\"\n\nBitch what do you think?\n\n[Anon]\n\"Yes Stella, how could you tell? This is me being alright.\"\n\nShe doesn't reply, but I can tell that she, too, has noticed the change in the mood.\n\nAfter a few minutes, my non-existent dignity compels me to at least put my dick away.\n\n[Stella]\n\"It's okay.\"\n\nSomething within me snaps. I look her hard in the eye, and shout so loud that I'm sure the entire school will hear.\n\n[Anon]\n\"OH! It's OKAY?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Wow Stella, did you read that from the stars? Or a deck of cards?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Are you such an expert in bitching yourself out from all the hentai doujin that you've read?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Or maybe it's cause you routinely ruin others' lives? Maybe that's got something to do with you having SOOOO many friends, right?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Maybe you should just fucking neck yourself, weeb retard!\"\n\nBy the end I'm seething with anger.\n\nSomewhere deep down I know that I'm just looking for an outlet to vent my spent up feelings.\n\nThat I've gone way, way too far.\n\nMaybe she's done something wrong, but I played along.\n\nHell, I sound like all the run of the mill bullies from my old school.\n\nI want to keep shouting, but I don't even have the strength for that anymore...\n\nMy shoulders drop, and I can just barely keep myself from curling up in fetal position.\n\nI just now notice the hot tears rolling down my face.\n\nBy some miracle, Stella hasn't left yet.\n\nFrom the corner of my eyes I can see her fists shaking, grasping the end of her jeans so hard that her knuckles have turned white.\n\n[Stella]\n\"T-take that back!\"\n\n...\n\n[Stella]\n\"Anon, take it back!\"\n\n...\n\n[Stella]\n\"Please.\"\n\nHer voice is soft. Sounds like she's choking back her tears right now, but won't be able to for long.\n\n...\n\nI feel utterly and completely miserable right now.\n\nSomehow I've managed to piss off or alienate everyone that I know and hold dear in just a few hours.\n\nIf I don't do something, I'll end up alone, again.\n\nFang and Reed can be mad at me for good reason. Hell, I won't even have anything to say if Naser breaks my arms. Or neck.\n\nBut Stella... No, I really did just say some fucked up stuff.\n\nShe might be a huge bitch, but she doesn't deserve this.\n\nI'm reminded of her giddy, pure and genuine excitement for her show yesterday. I can't turn someone like that into a broken cynical dipshit like me.\n\nUnlike everything else, I still have a chance to make this right at least.\n\n[Anon]\n\"...I'm sorry.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I take it all back.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"You're not so bad, Stella.\"\n\nI wipe some of my tears off, not that it really accomplishes anything. She scoots closer, placing a hand on my shoulder.\n\nWe stay like that for a good while, till my sobbing subsides.\n\n[Stella]\n\"So, are you okay now?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"...I guess.\"\n\nShe retreats her hand, coughing a bit.\n\n[Stella]\n\"So um... I'm not stupid, Anon. I know why you called me here.\"\n\nHuh? Where's this coming from all of a sudden?\n\n[Stella]\n\"And I know you're soooo crazy about Fang.\"\n\nSo then... What?\n\n[Stella]\n\"But geez, take a reality check!\"\n\nI... What?\n\n[Stella]\n\"You've known her for what? A month?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"You've been dating for half of that tops. It's not like, you're engaged or whatever.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"So what if you fool around with another girl?\"\n\nI...\n\nWhat she says sort of makes sense but... Fool around?\n\nI'm in a relationship for fucks sake!\n\nMaybe it hasn't been going on for long, but that doesn't give me the right to cheat on my partner.\n\nAnd if she's right, then what's the deal with Reed?\n\nHe KNEW that this shit is fucked. And so did I.\n\n...\n\nWell, I mean...\n\nOkay.\n\nNot counting my socially uneducated ass, now I have two opposing extremes that both make sense in their own way.\n\nWhich one would Fang agree with?\n\nLet's assume that--\n\n[Stella]\n\"Umm, Anon?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Huh?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"You've been like, mumbling for two minutes straight, is everything alright?\"\n\nFucking mumbling.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Uh, yeah...\"\n\nShe fidgets around a bit, apparently unsure what to do with the situation.\n\nTraces of her tears are still visible on her face, though I'm not sure if they from me being a dick or my literal dick.\n\nI don't even know which would make me feel worse anymore.\n\n...\n\nI decide that changing the subject is the best course of action here.\n\n[Anon]\n\"So uhh, like, cards?\"\n\nAt first she doesn't get what I mean - no wonders there -, but somehow she ends up explaining the idea and nuances of tarot cards to me.\n\nThis time I hear out without any insults.\n\nWell, without many insults.\n\nTruth be told if I don't focus in on her weirdness too much, she's not bad.\n\nApparently she puts the same amount of care and innocent ambition into anything she likes.\n\nMakes me wonder if that includes her, um, friendship towards me.\n\n* * *\n\nWe end up ditching the remainder of the class, then say awkward goodbyes when the bell rings. Stella is the last to leave.\n\nThe rest of the classes go on without further incident, leaving me to contemplate my life decisions.\n\nFang messages me a few times, short status reports on what they're doing with Reed. Sounds like he's doing good on his promise and managed to trap Fang for the entire day.\n\nIn a twisted way, it makes me want to laugh.\n\nMy original plan is all but ruins now, and I haven't gotten a single step closer to solving the issue with Fang peacefully.\n\nQuite the opposite.\n\nBut after listening to Stella and spending time with her...\n\nA growing part of me doesn't even want to explain anything to Fang anymore. Like Stella said, we're like...\n\nWho even says that we're in a serious relationship with Fang? We've never announced it as such, and only gone on, like, two dates.\n\nThat's not a relationship, that's literally just dating. Barely. Feeling the waters. So what if I'm seeing another girl?\n\n...\n\nWho am I trying to convince here?\n\nThroughout the rest of the classes, these two contradicting flows of thought keep me in an endless loop.\n\nI've had sex with a girl, while in a relationship.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nIt's at best a week old relationship that I'm obsessing over, and therefore I'm overreacting.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nIf that was the case, why did it upset Reed so much? He's acting like I've committed adultery, so it has to be a serious relationship.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nNot once was it stated that this is a SERIOUS relationship, and therefore I'm overreacting.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nMy initial reaction has to be the correct one, afterall I'm literally half of the relationship at hand and should know my feelings best.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nMy feelings can be just my turboautism acting up after years of nogf, and if I was normal I wouldn't take it this hard. Therefore I'm overreacting.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that I've had sex with a girl, while in a relationship.\n\n...\n\nOn and on it goes. My head feels like an infinity symbol.\n\nAfter an eternity of suffering the final bell rings, symbolizing my freedom to go ahead and fuck my life up even more.\n\nFang said that she'd come over to help with my music assignment, but I don't feel like talking to anyone.\n\nIf it angers Reed then so be it.\n\nI shoot her a quick message, excusing myself. She replies something but I can't be bothered to read it.\n\n* * *\n\nBack in my shitty flat I end up sitting a long time over the now day old tray of leftover dino nuggies.\n\nI leave it untouched again. My stomach protests, but I can't bring myself to eat.\n\nThe best course of action now is to soothe my nerves, to distract myself with something.\n\nShitposting would usually do it, but I don't feel like I could be clever enough to come up with anything good.\n\nRock Ring it is.\n\nThe mindless nature of shootan eventually brings me sweet delirium, and I don't even notice the sun setting.\n\nThe flickering light of the screen is all I need.\n\nAfter what could have been eight or so hours of just zoning out, the events of the day painfully crawl back into my consciousness.\n\nChecking my phone there's a mixture of messages from Fang, Reed, and Stella.\n\nI hate myself for it, but I only want to hear from one of them.\n\nMight as well, I deserve to feel like shit.\n\nMy thumb hovers over Stella's name for a long time before I open the conversation.\n\nOnly one message, fairly recent.\n\n[Stella]\n\"going 2 bed, how u doin?\"\n\nMy first instinct is to respond with \"bad\".\n\nAnd for reals? Yeah. That's what I end up sending to her too.\n\n[Anon]\n\"bad\"\n\nI check the others' messages as I wait for her reply.\n\nReed sent quite a few.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Your classes are over, right?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Bro?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Hey man, I can't keep her here forever\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Bro\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Where are you?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"K she's gone home.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Did you talk?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"How did it go?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Dude what's happening?\"\n\nHe gave up after that.\n\n[Fang]\n\"ye ok i cant come over anyway coz dads a dick\"\n\n[Fang]\n\"ugh im gonna kill reed >:V\"\n\n[Fang]\n\"and naser too\"\n\n[Fang]\n\"how was ur day btw\"\n\nI contemplate sending \"bad\" to her too, but then I'd have to explain.\n\nI'm about to type in some neutral sounding bullshit anyway, but then Stella's reply arrives.\n\nOnce again I'm disgusted by how fast I switch over to her from Fang.\n\nAnd yet there's that unmistakable feeling of excitement in my stomach.\n\n[Stella]\n\"aww!! want me to send something to make u feel better? <3\"\n\nDo I? I don't even know anymore.\n\n[Anon]\n\"how r u feeling\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"hot ;)\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"srsly\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"yeh ;)\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"no i mean seriously how are you\"\n\n...\n\nOh god how long is that reply gonna be?\n\n[Stella]\n\"im rewatching gurren lagann\"\n\nHuh.\n\n[Stella]\n\"do u like it?\"\n\nWow what a pleb.\n\nNo, my tastes is ultimately better cause-\n\nWait.\n\nThat's not what I've asked. Could she be having second thoughts?\n\nKinda late for that.\n\n[Anon]\n\"not what i asked\"\n\nIt takes her even more time to reply.\n\n[Stella]\n\"what did you mean I ruin others lives?\"\n\nOh. That.\n\nWould you look at that, I'm feeling like the waste of society again!\n\n[Anon]\n\"i didnt mean that\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"really?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"yes im sorry\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"but then why dont I have friends Anon?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"why dont I have a boyfriend?\"\n\nI have no answer. I mean, what can I say to her that she doesn't already know?\n\n\"It's because you're so weird.\"\n\nShe has to know that.\n\nPretty sure that I've heard Rosa say that to her.\n\nI'm also sure that I have too, on multiple occasions.\n\nUhhhhhhh...\n\nThis is getting awkward.\n\nSuddenly, she's calling me.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Uh, hey?\"\n\n...\n\nBitch speak up already.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Hey, I'm not bothering you am I?\"\n\nWhat, like for the last 24 hours? Nah.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Nah, don't worry about it.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Um...\"\n\nShe goes silent again, and I can only hear her breathing for a while. Maybe it's my mind playing tricks, but I swear that her breaths have that raspy undertone, like, could she have been crying?\n\nI didn't know it was possible for me to feel worse, but remembering my outburst on the rooftop makes me wish I was six feet under already. I have no idea how she could take that so calmly.\n\nAlthough maybe she didn't, apparently.\n\nBut still, Stella went out of her way to point out that I need a reality check, like she knows how relationships work.\n\nSure, she could have been just bullshitting me so I keep her as a sidepiece, but there seem to be more to this. It's too sudden for her to be all moody and shit after that.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Why can't I have friends, Anon? Why am I such a freak?\"\n\nYeah, my point exactly. Something happened.\n\nHOL UP\n\nRosa definitely would not have a crying Stella within five feet of her. She's not there. Or Stella isn't in the dorms?\n\nMaybe they've had a fight? I should find out somehow.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n[Anon]\n\"Did you have a fight with Rosa?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Uhm, how did you-- Wait, did-- She told you?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Is that why you've messaged me?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"What? No. You've messaged me first, remember?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Oh. Right.\"\n\n...\n\n[Anon]\n\"So what happened?\"\n\nWhy do I care?\n\n[Stella]\n\"I-it wasn't a fight, not really... Um...\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Some of Rosa's friends came over cause they were going out, and Rosa um... She wanted me to come along, but I didn't want to cause I didn't want to ruin their fun, and then Rosa wouldn't let it go, and she said something mean and I got mad and said something mean too, and then they left and I stayed and I feel soooo bad now!\"\n\nShe's talking increasingly faster, but I think I've got the gist of it.\n\nIt honestly doesn't sound that bad, and yet... Rosa said something mean to her? That would be a first.\n\nI mean, her usual go-to is the shoe, so it had to be something fucked up to get Stella this mad over it.\n\nLike more so than me literally telling her to kill herself.\n\nI'm scared to even ask, but I have to know.\n\n[Anon]\n\"W-what did she say?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"She said that if I don't go I'll just waste my life watching anime! Like that's a bad thing!\"\n\nI'm certain that my sigh albeit internal is powerful enough to be picked up on radar, and a few AM radio stations.\n\nThen I realize it.\n\nNo matter how laughable and trivial this sounds, Rosa did just offhand confess to not only not caring for Stella's main area of interest, but actively condemning it. Something that I'd wager she didn't let slip until now.\n\nThat she sees herself better than Stella, who is 'just a weeb'.\n\nConsidering that Rosa is kinda her only friend, I understand how this could leave a deep wound in Stella's heart.\n\nAfterall I am a firsthand witness to how much she cares for her anime.\n\nCringey or not, phase or not, outgrow it she might, for the here and now this is important to Stella, and therefore it's important to me.\n\n...\n\nWhatwasthat?\n\nUh...\n\nIt uh, it's important to Stella. Yes.\n\n...\n\nI should say something.\n\n[Anon]\n\"I see.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"So uh, what did you say to her?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nLong ass fucking silence.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Was it that bad?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Mhm.\"\n\nI can't even imagine. But I guess prying this particular bit isn't helpful.\n\nOkay so, what happens now? I can't make this right or magic up some friends for her. Not to mention that I should keep my distance cause of the whole Fang thing.\n\nThat last part really makes all of this a whole lot more confusing than it needs to be.\n\nI guess now it's my turn to make her feel better by being friendly, supportive, and DEFINITELY not flirty so that she won't take it the wrong way. Just make her know that she matters, nothing more.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Well, if it makes you feel any better I totally jerked off to the pics you sent yesterday.\"\n\n...\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me? Maybe there's a reason why I write drafts before ordering a pizza.\n\nEVASIVE MANEUVERS\n\nDAMAGE CONTROL\n\nDAMAGE CONTROL\n\n[Anon]\n\"Er, I mean, do a tarot card reading for me?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Y-you did?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Let's pretend you didn't hear that?\"\n\nWHAT WAS I THINKING\n\n[Stella]\n\"T-that's kinda hot, Anon...\"\n\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nMORE DAMAGE CONTROL\n\n[Anon]\n\"Haha, I'm just joking!\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"...oh\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"So you didn't like them?\"\n\nOh god I'm sweating fucking oceans here.\n\nMAXIMUM DAMAGE CONTROL MODE ENGAGE\n\n[Anon]\n\"Haha no! Not one bit! Like how could I, right? Haha! They were terrible! Haha!\"\n\nAaaaaaaaaaaand there goes the call.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhat did I say?\n\n...\n\nOh.\n\nOH.\n\nGreat. Now she must think that she's a freak AND that she's ugly.\n\nI try calling her back, but she's not answering. This is not good.\n\nWell, okay, but maybe Rosa will cheer her up, right?\n\nWait.\n\nOh fuck.\n\nOh, fuck me!\n\nI try calling again, still no answer.\n\nMy words from the rooftop echo in my mind.\n\n\"Maybe you should just fucking neck yourself!\"\n\nShe- She's not seriously about to-\n\nRight?\n\nFuck! What's the time?\n\nTwo in the fucking morning.\n\nNo way are there buses at this hour. Maybe I could call a taxi?\n\nNo. I don't want people to know that I'm going to the girls' dorms at night. How could I even explain that to the driver?\n\nBut... Even if I could by some miracle run all the way there, that'd take like at least half an hour. If she's about to- No, that's just too much time.\n\nI try the phone again.\n\n\"Maybe you should just fucking neck yourself!\"\n\nNot only is there no answer, but looks like she turned it off too. That or she blocked me.\n\nOKAY FUCK IT\n\n* * *\n\nAbout an hour later I round the last corner to the dorms. Halfway there my underfed body made it painfully obvious that it's definitely not going to be a half-hour trip.\n\nI'm dripping with sweat and wheezing like a chain smoker. My legs are just about to give out. I swear that I can see dots dancing on the edge of my vision too.\n\nI've tried calling Stella multiple times, to no avail. Even tried Rosa once, but one second after I dropped Stella's name she threw a wall of Spanish curses my way, then hung up. At least I think they were curses.\n\n[Rosa]\n\"An-on? What is up?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Rosa! I think Stella's about to--\"\n\n[Rosa]\n\"Stella? \u00a1Fucking PUTA! \u00a1LA MADRE QUE TE PARI\u00d3!\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"YOU'RE NOT LISTENING SHE'S GONNA FUCKING--\"\n\n[Rosa]\n\"\u00a1STELLA VETE AL CARAJO! \u00a1VETE A TOMAR POR CULO! \u00a1MIERDA!\"\n\nLike that.\n\n...\n\nThere's no commotion outside the building, so at least she's not jumped off the roof or anything dramatic like that.\n\nPeople would have noticed, right?\n\nOne last deep breath, and I'm jogging to the building.\n\nAlmost made it inside too, before someone tackles me.\n\n[????]\n\"Hold your horses boy, where do you think you're going?\"\n\n[????]\n\"We're closed for the night.\"\n\nFuck, I should have known they'd have security.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Dude you gotta let me in, she's-\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"Oh, I'm sure that you'll be able to work this out with your girlfriend. In the morning.\"\n\nWHY THE FUCK IS NO ONE LISTENING\n\n[Anon]\n\"SHE'S ABOUT TO FUCKING KILL HERSELF MAN!\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"YOU HAVE TO LET ME IN!\"\n\nHe's taken aback, but still won't let go of me.\n\n[Guard]\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Stella! Stella is going to fucking neck herself you meteor dodger faggot now let go of me, retard!\"\n\nThe guard looks like he doesn't know whether to break my jaw or throw me into the bushes. Maybe both, in that order.\n\nThis is taking too fucking long. Every second now, she could be...\n\nStill, this asshole drags me into his booth or whatever instead of letting me save her.\n\n[Guard]\n\"You stay the fuck here, I'm going to make an announcement.\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"This better not be a fucking joke, you hear me?\"\n\nHe gives me the dead eyes, as if I fucking cared.\n\n[Guard]\n\"This the weird stego chick you talking about?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Yes, it fucking is. Stella.\"\n\nThe PA system cracks to life, and the guard's voice booms over the empty corridors.\n\n[Guard]\n\"Stella! Come to the entrance immediately!\"\n\nHe repeats it, and I'm left there dumbfounded.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Are you fucking high? She's not gonna come here if she's dead!\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"Watch your fucking mouth, boy. What's your name?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"What? I- My name is Anon Mous.\"\n\nHe returns to the PA one more time.\n\n[Guard]\n\"Stella, come to the entrance. Anon is here for you.\"\n\nMy heart skips a beat.\n\nOh, that's just great. Now the whole school will know that I visited the girls' dorms late at night. Stella, specifically.\n\nI can just about imagine the rumor mill.\n\n...\n\nI'm getting increasingly nervous as we wait. Thankfully we have view of the shitty cameras, and eventually a Stella-shaped blob shows up on one of them.\n\nTremendous weights lift off my shoulder, and I almost tear up.\n\nShe's okay. She's alive.\n\nThank fuck! I don't even care if I'm getting arrested now.\n\nWe watch her make her way to the gate in silence. A dozen doors open all over the place, but nobody stops her.\n\nOnce she gets close enough the guard gets up to meet her. I'm practically on his heels.\n\nAs soon as Stella is through the doors I rush up to her, embracing her in a tight hug.\n\n[Stella]\n\"A-Anon? What's going on?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Oh god, oh fuck you're alright! You're alright!\"\n\nShe doesn't really know how to respond, and I don't fault her for that.\n\nI can feel her awkwardly returning the hug, but the guard soon breaks it up.\n\n[Guard]\n\"Okay boy, you mind telling me what's all this about?\"\n\nUh.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Um... I was wrong?\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"Yeah. No shit.\"\n\nHe looks at his watch, then sighs.\n\n[Guard]\n\"Here's what's going to happen.\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"I'm going to write a detailed report of how a certain Anon Mous caused a serious disturbance here, late at night. You can bet this is going to have consequences.\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"While I do that you two take whatever the fuck this is up to her room. But no funny business, or so help me I will make you a sex offender in that report.\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"Am I clear here?\"\n\n...\n\n[Guard]\n\"Go. Now.\"\n\n* * *\n\nWith that, we make our walk of shame up to her room. The stares of the lingering strands of students practically drill holes through us.\n\nI'm sure that half of the school already knows, and the rest will know come morning.\n\nIncluding Fang.\n\nI don't know if I'm making another mistake here or not, but I decide that turning my phone off is the smart thing to do.\n\nNeither of us speaks up until she's locked the door behind us. Actually, not even after.\n\nThe room is not how I remembered it.\n\nIt wasn't tidy the last time either, but now it has shit thrown around everywhere. More clothes, books, cards, linen from both beds. I can even see the side of a laptop jutting out from under a cupboard at an angle that surely isn't within the bounds of \"intended use\". The desks too, have almost all of their shelves pulled out and thrown about.\n\nA total battlefield. Makes me wonder if this is the result of her fight with Rosa, or if it happened after.\n\nWe sit down on the remains of Rosa's bed.\n\nStella looks awkward and unsure. Like a doe in the headlights. Her hair, her mascara, it's all messed up too. In other circumstances, it would be kinda hot.\n\nThis has got to be about her worst day ever.\n\nI can't help but notice her cute pajamas though. The best way I can describe them is \"girly\". Like seriously what a six-year-old would wear, complete with a mosaic pattern of teddy bears.\n\nI'm so lost in examination that I almost miss her soft voice.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Anon, what is going on? Why are you here?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I, like, when the call- And then when I and the Rosa then, so- And I'm here.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"W-what?\"\n\nRight, let's try that again.\n\n[Anon]\n\"When you hung up I uh, I remembered how I shouted at you on the roof, and that you're fucked up now, and that Rosa won't be here, and I thought that you'd, like, want to and so then I here but the dude, like, the guard dude wouldn't, and then--\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Anon stop! You're not making sense again.\"\n\nAhhh come onnnn!\n\nI take a deep breath to give it another go, but she stops me.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I... Got it.\"\n\nShe looks away, embarrassed.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\nHuh? What's she talking about?\n\n[Anon]\n\"What? But I'm the one that fucked up everything.\"\n\n...\n\n[Stella]\n\"No Anon, you're not. If it wasn't for me, you would be at home happily sleeping. Hell, maybe you'd be with Fang right now.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"It's like you said, all I do is ruin others' lives.\"\n\nI want to protest, but she covers my mouth with a hand.\n\nGuess after my eloquent speech it's her turn now.\n\n[Stella]\n\"You were right that I shouldn't have... I shouldn't have kissed you and- And I shouldn't have done any of the things that I did.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"But I was so happy that I've finally found someone that doesn't think anime is just a waste of time.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"And... I knew that you're with Fang, but I was so caught up with the idea of finally having a boyfriend that I could talk to, and who would care for stuff I care about, that I just...\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"And then that night you messaged me, and I was so happy about it!\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"...but then all that stuff you said on the roof...\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"And I know you took it back, but I knew that you were right. Nobody wants to be my friend, not for real. Even with you, I was...\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"I'm just such a homewrecker...\"\n\nI desperately want to interject before she gets to the murder-suicide part.\n\n[Stella]\n\"But... You still wouldn't want me to go... And you're here now too... And I...\"\n\nShe starts shuffling around, slowly inching her way to me.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I...\"\n\nI can't help but sit there, frozen to the core as her slender fingers make way for her strawberry flavored lips.\n\nThe kiss, same as the last one, starts slow and awkward. But whereas she pulled away last time, this time she doubles down.\n\nI can feel a dexterous tongue slither into my mouth, and any resistance I might have had melts right away.\n\nEvery fiber, every atom of my body knows how wrong this is. But I couldn't care less.\n\nOur hands find eachother, fingers intertwining.\n\nI lay back on the bed and Stella gets on top of me. The kiss breaks merely so we can take a breather. Her hot breath is driving me crazy.\n\nI look into her eyes, and she looks back at me. We both know that we should stop. Hell, that we shouldn't have done any of this to begin with. But our lives are forfeit already.\n\nNot a second passes and we're connected again, silently confirming that there are no breaks on this train. Not anymore.\n\nOur hands drift apart and start to explore all the fun new places.\n\nHer scales are smooth but hot against my palm. It doesn't take me long to figure out that she's not wearing a bra right now.\n\nHeh. Titties.\n\nI've never had one in my hand before. It feels so nice and warm. Plump, but with the right amount of perkiness.\n\nMeanwhile, Stella has settled into kind of a missionary position. Or like, reverse missionary. What's it called with the guy on the bottom?\n\nAnyway, she's grinding up a storm against my jeans hiding one diamond of a dick.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Anon... I want it... I want you.\"\n\nOh fuck, that's fucking hot.\n\nWe're locked in another kiss, only awkwardly breaking it up so I can take her shirt off.\n\nIt would have been nice to have a look at her like that, but feeling her bare breasts press up against my chest is its own reward.\n\nBut uh, we should get on the undressing me situation, I guess. How complicated can sex be? Lots of people have it, I'm told.\n\n[Anon]\n\"C-could you um...?\"\n\nI motion for her to move so I can take off my shirt.\n\nShe tries, but we don't really manage it. I just can't do it while laying down like this.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Maybe we should...\"\n\nShe gets off of me, and FINALLY I get a good look at her boobs.\n\n...\n\nShe has two of them.\n\nThey're green.\n\nThe right one points to the side a little.\n\n[Anon]\n\"You're beautiful.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Get naked already! Geez!\"\n\nThe contrast between her nervous fidgeting against the top-slut-tier blowjob on the roof is day and night. I don't really get what's the difference, but I don't mind.\n\nMaybe that was bad bitch Stella, and this is the real Stella?\n\nIn any case, we both undress. Separately. It's awkward, to say the least.\n\nBut damn, being naked with a girl is way too exciting. Our faces are so red that you'd think we just ran a marathon.\n\nWell, I kinda did.\n\nStella returns to me, dropping her panties just before straddling me again. Her body feels incredibly warm, and the sensation of the tip of her scales ever so slightly biting into my skin is an exciting, alien one.\n\nIn return my naked dick pokes at her soft thighs. There's an unmistakable moisture covering them.\n\nWe lay back again, joined in a slow but passionate kiss.\n\nShe reaches for my dick, but her hand jolts back as soon as she touches it. Once, twice...\n\nIn the end, I grab her hand and forcibly wrap her fingers around it. Her breath shortens, and every muscle in her body tenses up.\n\nIt doesn't last more than a second though, and soon she's lining herself up for... Up for...\n\nNow it's my body that stiffens, the tip touching her puffy lips. For a fraction of a moment, the sane part of my mind wonders how we've got here. But it's quickly overruled.\n\n[Stella]\n\"A-Anon, I'm g-going to... Okay?\"\n\nI nod, moving my hands to her waist in encouragement.\n\nInstinctively I hold my breath, and I can see her doing the same. Slowly, ever so slowly she descends. I have no idea how to describe the feeling other than \"warm\".\n\nLines from various doujins and smuts flood my mind, like \"velvety insides\" and \"so hot I'm melting\". I feel kinda let down, cause it just feels wet and warm, but it's not like I've expected those to be documentaries.\n\nAlthough as she gets more and more down- It's getting- Yeah it- Oh. Oh, it- Wow.\n\nOhfuckmethisfeelsamazing.\n\nMy grip tightens around her, which prompts her to stop with a surprised yelp.\n\n[Stella]\n\"A-are you okay? I-is this okay?\"\n\nHer face is so red that I'm like legit afraid for her brain.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Y-yeah. Is it okay for you?\"\n\nShe just nods, but doesn't go any lower.\n\nI pull her into another kiss, and we settle into a lustful yet awkward rhythm. It's apparent that neither of us has any experience whatsoever.\n\nOur movement evens out as we get into it, and I risk going in all the way too.\n\nIt might have been a hasty decision.\n\nStella stops, wincing painfully.\n\n[Stella]\n\"A-ah... Fuck...\"\n\nI try backing away, panicked, but she keeps me pinned down. And then I feel it.\n\nAt first I just feel that something weird is going on down there, like it just got warmer and wetter. I have a pretty good guess, and looking there... Yep. Blood.\n\nOh shit. I didn't even consider that she was a virgin like me. Not after that blowjob.\n\nI want to apologize, but somehow I feel like that'd make it worse.\n\nThere are tears in her eyes now, and she's still trying to gulp the pain down. But... She's not looking, like, sad about it.\n\nIn fact, despite her obvious discomfort she gives me a bright, almost grateful smile. She slows to a halt, running her fingers along my face. In return, I hug her tight - but like, trying to not make her hurt more.\n\nHer disheveld hair sticks to her face on several spots, mascara running all over the place. Her eyes are still red from crying, though the rest of her face matches in color now.\n\nNothing short of an absolute mess.\n\nStill, in that moment, I feel closer to her than to anyone else in a very, very long time. I- I'm not even sure what to think about that. But I do know that I don't want to think about it. Not now.\n\nRight now, I'm...\n\nHappy?\n\nYeah... Yeah, definitely! I'm happy to have made her happy. Even in an idiotic manner like this.\n\nNo. It's not even idiotic.\n\nPushing in all the way like in the pornos? Okay, that was dumb. But taking her virginity? No. I'm not regretting that, and I never will. Relationship drama can go to hell!\n\nI can't even comprehend what it must mean for her. She's given her everything to me, and I'm happy for it. I'm accepting HER, the weird occult-shit-loving tarot-card-reading astrology-believer weeb stego that she is.\n\nCan't help but smile at that, like she is.\n\nBesides, I've practially already given my life up for her.\n\nWe're just a couple of idiots, admitting it to eachother. Nothing in our lives is more important than the other, not in the here and now.\n\nI know that blurting out \"I love you\" would probably ruin everything and even more, but I'm not far from it.\n\nSadly, the moment doesn't last forever.\n\nHer smile drops, rugged breahts testament of the prolonged pain she's enduring. Must be uh, a good pain, I guess.\n\nWe stay like that for a bit, in the end she collapses onto me. There's a pitiful attempt on her part to bounce up and down, but she can't keep that up for more than a few seconds.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Um... Could we um... Switch places?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"W-we can stop if--\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"No, I... I don't want to stop.\"\n\nShe gives me a peck on the lips, then gets up. Her stiff, jerky movements show that she's still obviously in pain.\n\nMakes me feel like an asshole. But I guess that's just how it works?\n\nThis time she lays down, and I get on top of her. We start going at it again, but her face contorts in pain right from the getgo.\n\nWe try kissing to distract her, but it's not working.\n\nAfter about a minute or so she gently pushes me away, and excuses herself to the bathroom. Wow. I hope I didn't seriously fuck something up.\n\nI try not to overthink the situation as I wait for her. Instead, I wipe myself off from the various body fluids and put my boxers back on.\n\nA few minutes later she returns. With panties on.\n\nShe sits down next to me, avoiding eye contact. She looks extremely sad.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I'm sorry that I fucked this up too.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Hey, it's okay. I'm sorry too, I wasn't thinking.\"\n\nI pull her into a hug and we lay back, cuddling.\n\nWe stay like that for a while, enjoying the other's company.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Did you at least enjoy it?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Yeah, you?\"\n\nStupid question.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Um... Yes.\"\n\nHuh.\n\nMore silence.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Aren't you going to regret it?\"\n\n...\n\n[Anon]\n\"That's tomorrow talk, okay?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"...okay...\"\n\nShe's not convinced, but I guess part of her appreciates the gesture.\n\nI pull her close, cradling her head under mine. No more words.\n\nI don't know how long after, we drift to sleep.\n\n* * *\n\nI wake in a strange bed, in a strange place, beside another person.\n\nIt takes me a few seconds to recollect the events that have transpired, and when I do, I'm filled with nothing but dread.\n\nWell, that's not quite right. There is a persistent rebellion lighting up inside my soul, unwilling to take the blame anymore.\n\nWith the feeling of Stella's warm body in my arms, and the harsh coldness of my crimes in my head, I am no longer able to tell right from wrong.\n\nWas it wrong of me to cheat on Fang? It was, and I cannot - I will not - hold anyone else responsible for that.\n\nWas it right of me to come to Stella in her time of need? It was, who else could have done it? Hell, who else WOULD have done it?\n\nEven if her life wasn't ultimately in danger, with all of her friends gone and all of her pride crumbled to dust, she was about to go down a very dangerous road. I will never-ever be ashamed of stepping out of the mass of apathy, stopping a disaster before it could take hold.\n\nNot after what I've had to live through in the past. Even if it will cost suffering of my own.\n\nIt might have been the only truly right thing that I've done in my life, the one that really mattered.\n\nI strengthen my hold on Stella. I don't want to let her go.\n\n...still, I know that I've done things that are unforgivable under any circumstance. I've had ample opportunities to come clear with Fang, yet I didn't. I couldn't trust her to know the truth, and I couldn't share the burden.\n\nFor a second I entertain the thought that I was sparing her the pain, but it's such an obvious lie that I push it away immediately.\n\nNo. I, and only I, am responsible for deciding to go through this alone. I might have asked Reed's help, but I've ultimately let him down too.\n\nMy hands curl into fists, and I'm unsure if it's from anger or disgust. Maybe both? Resentment.\n\nI resent the fact that after coming such a long way, I am still the same cynical untrusting retard that's afraid to let anyone close in things that actually matter. The act of helping someone with her homework, or playing the guitar with her... These pale in comparison to my unquestioned willingness to STILL consider each fight a fight of my own.\n\nThat I cannot turn the \"me\" to \"us\" in the phrase: \"Me against the word\".\n\nThis cannot continue.\n\nBefore I could further the thought, a set of heavy fists bang away at the door.\n\nKNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\n\n[????]\n\"What's going on in there?\"\n\nI jolt upright, causing Stella to wake as well.\n\nThe voice definitely belongs to one very pissed-off Rosa.\n\nFUCK\n\n[Rosa]\n\"Stella, open the door!\"\n\nFUCK FUCK FUCK\n\nWe look at one another in sheer terror, the same thought flashing through both of our minds.\n\nGET FUCKING DRESSED\n\nStumbling out of the bed - Rosa's bed by the way - we try gathering up our respective articles of clothing.\n\nShe puts on her bra, I put on my sock, she puts on her pants. With a mismatched sock in my hand, I get Stella's attention.\n\nShe motions that yes it's fucking hers, and to help her with it.\n\nI try, but with her leg moving all around, it's not an easy operation.\n\nTo make it all worse, I can hear a key slipping into the lock.\n\nOH THAT'S IT\n\nWE'RE DEAD\n\nI'M DEAD\n\nGoing by my luck, she might as well have Fang in tow. The police too, ready to register me as an offender. Then it truly would be the end of the line.\n\nWe freeze, my hand still grabbing her leg, awaiting the inevitable.\n\n...\n\nNothing happens.\n\nSounds of commotion come from the other side of the door, and another familiar voice joins the fray.\n\n[????]\n\"Rosa! Hey Rosa, wait!\"\n\nI- I refuse to believe it. Is- is that Reed? What's he doing here? After all that I've done, he- is he...?\n\n[Reed]\n\"Don't go in!\"\n\n[Rosa]\n\"Why wouldn't I do that, pendejo?\"\n\n...\n\n[Reed]\n\"Cause uh, it's a hotbox.\"\n\n[Rosa]\n\"Hot box? What is that?\"\n\nFirst I have no idea what Reed is talking about, but then it hits me square in the chest.\n\nIt's a distraction! He knows I'm here and it's a fucking distraction!\n\nI shake off the shock and return to dressing Stella. On comes her shirt, backwards but I don't care, then another sock.\n\nWait, is that different from the other?\n\nNO MATTER\n\nNO TIME\n\nFragments of the outside conversation hit my ears, along the lines of \"can't let the smoke out or Stella's gonna get banned from the dorms\", but Rosa isn't taking the bait anymore.\n\nIn midst of putting my shirt on, the door opens.\n\nRosa looks at me, then Stella, then around the room, then at Stella again, but in the end her eyes lock onto me.\n\nIt takes her a second to register all of the information. Her eyes fill with what I assume to be rage. But before she could do anything, Reed acts first.\n\nTo my disbelief he puts Rosa into a very familiar chokehold from behind, trying to avert her gaze.\n\nToo little too late though, and he's overpowered in a matter of seconds, sent flying back into the hallway.\n\n[Rosa]\n\"An-on, what is happening here? Why are you taking your clothes off?\"\n\nI, wait, off?\n\nOh god, she thinks that we were about to fuck.\n\nI want to speak up, but my tongue is just as frozen as the rest of my body. Thankfully, Stella does.\n\n[Stella]\n\"This isn't what it looks like!\"\n\nCould have been less of a clich\u00e9, but that's essentially true. I finish putting my shirt on, but can't otherwise add anything to the situation.\n\nReed crawls back in through the door too, clutching onto his ribcage.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Geez Rosa, I think you broke my ribs...\"\n\nHe, too, looks around and at us, his expression unreadable. Though he does give me one stare of pity and disbelief, which hits me pretty bad.\n\nRosa pays her little attention though, eyeing daggers at Stella and me. She's handling the current development shockingly well considering that, well, she is Rosa. Maybe she remembers my call from last night.\n\nShe closes the door, sealing the four of us in.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Dude, out the truth now. Fang's on her way here!\"\n\n[Rosa]\n\"I would also like an explanation.\"\n\nTheir words are simple, and their words are just.\n\nAnd yet all they do is evoke that ever-growing rebellion inside me. A dam can only hold so much water.\n\nI give one last weary sigh, then with determination in my eyes I speak, addressing both Rosa and Reed.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Sit down, the both of you.\"\n\nWhat follows is my recollection of the past 32 hours.\n\nI tell them about the bet and the wager. I tell them about watching SAO together, and that kiss. I tell them how confused and damned I've felt about it, and I tell them how I couldn't stop myself from messaging Stella that night.\n\nI tell them about what happened, and the guilt I've felt over it. I tell about my sharing the secret with Reed, turning him into my accomplice, and I tell the shame of the rooftop encounter.\n\nI tell about my doubts, and I tell about my turmoil.\n\nI tell it all, and I tell it true.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the events of last night, I hesitate. Stella, who's been mostly silent up to this point, in a rare feat of courage stands up. She takes my hand and continues the story from her point of view.\n\nShe turns to Rosa, apologizing for what she said and claiming that it was both because of her pent-up feelings and because of what I've said, but also because she was done with people looking down on her for her unconventional interests.\n\nStella then details that for years now she's been feeling like an outcast, that she's had no real relationships with anyone - friendship or more.\n\nShe knew that what she did was wrong, and yet she couldn't let it go. That yes, she was looking for a boyfriend, any boyfriend, but that it wasn't the case anymore.\n\nThe sex part ends up being omitted, although Stella ends her speech with a thought that very well could have been said by me too.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I have no excuses, but I won't say that all I did was wrong.\"\n\nThe other duo takes our words in a mute stupor. They look at eachother, and then back to us. Nobody breaks the silence.\n\nIt lingers between us for a good while, until another set of knocks can be heard from the door. They're a lot softer this time around, and I have a pretty good guess who they might belong to.\n\nAn icy hand claws into my guts. With my emotions spent, all that remains is the guilt.\n\nRosa walks to the door, opening it without a word.\n\nOn the other side stood none other than Fang, in a way that I've never seen her. Unsure. Tentative.\n\nShe was clutching onto one of her arms, looking in our direction meekly, but more so at the floor.\n\nThere's no need for questions, she's obviously heard our confession.\n\nShe walks in, Rosa closing the door behind her as if it was an omen. Nailing the coffin shut.\n\nFang stands before me, finally finding it in herself to look me in the eye. There are no tears, but her gaze screams pain.\n\nShe feels betrayed, and rightly so. I was the one she could put her faith, her trust in, and I've gone ahead to throw it away brazenly.\n\nThere are no words between us. She doesn't ask me if this is a joke, or if I've even loved her at all. She doesn't blame me, she doesn't shout at me.\n\nTo her, I'm now just a part of the painful past, yet another object trophy to remind her never to trust anyone again.\n\nWhatever justification I've had towards the fling with Stella, none of that seems to matter now. Even if I did save one life, I've ended another. I've picked her up, and let her down. In the worst way possible.\n\nI want to apologize, but it seems all so pointless now. \"Hey, I've shot your dog but you can keep it.\"\n\nI don't imagine there's any combination of words in the English language that would help the situation. Though I'd be more than willing to speak them, for Fang's sake.\n\nA few seconds later she turns to Stella, whose hand I'm still holding onto.\n\nThere's a wordless back and forth between them, one that I cannot fathom to comprehend. Who could Stella be looking at really? Fang or Lucy? And who does Fang see, a freak of a homewrecker, or another soul to save? Her expression is unchanging. Still. Stoic. Save for the pain in her eyes.\n\nStella on the other hand is fidgeting around nervously, on the verge of tears, but not willing to back down.\n\nIt must be hard for her. If I somehow manage to save myself and stay with Fang, Stella loses everything. She won't just be a weird loner anymore, she'll be condemned for possibly her whole life. But if she wins me over, we're a horrible couple of cheaters. Not that we aren't regardless.\n\nFang's silent inspection continues for a bit, ending with a ragged sigh.\n\nShe turns away from us, sitting down on a more or less empty chair, away from the rest of us. Looking at the floor once again, cradling her hands in her lap.\n\nHer voice is soft, barely audible. It breaks my heart to see her like this.\n\n[Fang]\n\"I knew something might be up...\"\n\nShe turns to Reed.\n\n[Fang]\n\"Yesterday, when you kept me from classes. I knew something had to happen cause you'd never put that much effort into one single thing otherwise.\"\n\nHe looks away embarrassed. Reed probably didn't consider that he'd be the one to raise suspicion in Fang. I don't blame him one bit though, he was more than helpful.\n\nAlthough that might even make it worse for him, that he choose to side with a confessed cheater and liar rather than his friend. And that it was all for nothing.\n\nI feel a pang of pride that my girlfriend is so sharp and clever, but it turns to a spike of pain rather quickly. I cannot claim to be her boyfriend anymore. Not even her friend, probably.\n\n[Fang]\n\"...but I never would have thought...\"\n\n...\n\nHer next words address Stella.\n\n[Fang]\n\"Is it true what you said, do you really need Anon? Do you love HIM?\"\n\nAll of our eyes widen at the questions. S-she's-\n\nStella, no longer able to compose herself falls back on the bed.\n\nShe buries her face in her hands, rocking back and forth. Her tail, usually wrapped around her leg, is flopping beside her as if all power left it.\n\nStill hidden behind her cover, she speaks up in barely more than a whisper.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I do.\"\n\nSilence falls upon the room again as Fang processes her words. I can't bring myself to look at her anymore. I close my eyes, shutting the world out.\n\nAll of my guilt, all of my fears, all of my sins culminate in this moment, laid bare for the judgment of one.\n\nI hear her chair creak, footsteps closing to us. I can only surmise that Fang's coming to deck me in the jaw or break my legs. If that's the case, I will not resist.\n\nInstead, I feel a familiar set of arms wrap around me, followed by a pair of feathery wings. I open my eyes, but all I can see are a few strands of silvery hair as she nuzzles her face against mine.\n\nShe hugs me tightly, whispering into my ear.\n\n[Fang]\n\"Then this is goodbye, Anon. Thank you for caring about me... Till you did...\"\n\nI can't muster a response, my insides twisting up painfully.\n\nShe lets me go and moves to Stella.\n\n[Fang]\n\"He can be a big retard, but please take care of him.\"\n\n[Fang]\n\"And if you don't, so help me...\"\n\nStella, frozen much of the same as me, can barely produce a nod.\n\nWith that, Fang takes not another moment, leaving without a further thought spared on our miserable company.\n\nNobody speaks another word either.\n\nEventually, Reed leaves too, followed by a confused Rosa. She looks back as if she wants to say something, but decides not to.\n\nThe door is now closed.\n\n* * *\n\nA few days have passed since that day. The shame and pain remain, but things have returned to more or less their usual rhythm.\n\nStella and I stayed together, while Fang and Reed rather keep their distance from us. I don't blame them one bit.\n\nNaser, when he learned what I did threaten to beat me up, and it took all of Fang's pleading to stop him.

Bitch Stella Remastered Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Stella","Bad Bitch Stella Remastered Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"Chapter 4: Reforging The Link\n\nI wake in a bed that isn't my own, in a strange place I barely recognized, beside another person that's equal parts a stranger and familiar to me.\n\nIt takes me a few seconds to recollect the events that have transpired. Memory is hazy at first, but gradually, the memories flood back in. The calls, the panic, the rush of emotion, the sudden acceptance of lust and love. That last part puts me on alert, forcing my still zoned-out brain to work double to decipher what it could mean. When I, at last, put it together and the memories form a coherent film of recollections, I'm filled with nothing but dread.\n\nWell, 'dread' is not quite the word I'd use. There is a persistent rebellion lighting up inside my soul. It's a war over what's my fault, what isn't my fault, and what I'm willing and unwilling to take the blame for\u2026 and the biggest part of me isn't willing to take it anymore .\n\nWith the feeling of Stella's warm body in my arms and the harsh coldness of my crimes in my head, I am no longer able to tell right from wrong. Was it really wrong of me to cheat on Fang? Yes, it was. I can not\u2014I WILL not\u2014hold anyone else responsible for that fuck-up.\n\nWas it right of me to come to Stella in her time of need? Yes. Yes, it was. Who else could have done it? Hell, who else WOULD have done it? Even if her life ultimately wasn't in danger and it was all my stupid imagination overreacting, with all her friends gone and all her pride crumbled to dust, she was about to go down a dangerous road. People could say all they want about me and how I'm the biggest asshole of them all. People can screech and moan and fling their shit all they want about how big of a mistake this whole thing was. I will never be ashamed of stepping out of the mass of apathy I've been living in and stopping a disaster before it could happen, especially after what I've had to live through in the past. Even if it will cost suffering of my own, it might be the only genuinely right thing I've done in my entire life; the only thing that mattered.\n\nI strengthen my hold on Stella's being. I don't want to let her go...\n\nI know that I've done things that are unforgivable under any circumstance. I've had ample opportunities to come clean with Fang. I had plenty of chances to call it off and walk away before things went off the rails. Yet, I didn't. I couldn't trust Fang to know the truth, and I couldn't share the burden with her even though, as lovers, we're supposed to support each other through thick and thin. 'Till death do us part, and whatnot,' I bitterly reflect. For a second, I entertain the notion that I was sparing Fang the pain. That's such a blatant lie, though. I push it away immediately.\n\nNo. I\u2014and only I\u2014am responsible for deciding to go through this alone. I might have asked Reed's help but ultimately let him down too, even when he risked his neck for me as a real bro would.\n\nMy hands curl into fists. I'm unsure if it's from anger or disgust. Maybe both? Could be resentment. Resent at the fact that after coming such a long way, I am still the same cynical, untrusting retard that's afraid to let anyone close in on things that actually matter. The act of helping someone with her homework or playing the guitar with her\u2026 those pale in comparison to my unquestioned willingness to STILL consider each fight a fight of my own. That I cannot turn the 'me' to 'us' in the phrase: 'Me against the world.'\n\nThis cannot continue...\n\nBefore I could further the thought, there is a thunderous set of bangs on Stella's door.\n\n\"WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE!?\" Rosa's voice shouts as loud as she can from the other side of the door.\n\nI jolt upright, causing Stella to wake up as well. She lets out a cute little yawn and rubs her eyes. \"W-what time is it?\" she innocently asks, almost as if not recognizing where she is or with whom she is currently laying.\n\nAnother set of hard knocks threatens to knock the door off its hinges. \"STELLA! STELLA!? \u00a1Abri esta puerta ahora mismo, o juro en el nombre de Raptor Jesus que la voy a Derribar!\"\n\nOn hearing Rosa's words, Stella fully springs awake. Almost as if going through my previous thoughts, just in super-fast motion, she looks around, looks at me, has her face go from joy to sorrow, to worry, and ultimately to shit-panting fear before grabbing me by the shoulder.\n\n\"It's R-Rosa!\" She half-yells as she gives the door another look, almost as if to verify that she wasn't seeing or hearing things.\n\nWhen there's a third set of hard knocks, we look to one another in sheer terror, the same thought flashing through both of our minds:\n\n' GET FUCKING DRESSED! '\n\nStumbling out of bed\u2014Rosa's bed, by the way\u2014Stella and I try gathering up our respective articles of clothing. Unfortunately, due to all the other pieces of clothes tossed around the room, what should have been an easy task becomes nothing short of a nightmare. Stella dives for the nearest bra in her sight and rapidly puts that on. I practically do a tactical drop and slide for what I believe are my socks. As I do, I chance a glance towards Stella, only then noticing that the bra she's wearing seems to be a bit bigger than her breasts. The things also have what look like a floral pattern to them...\n\nI don't think much about that as I slip one of my socks on. Meanwhile, Stella has found and is actively putting on what I can only really call her booty shorts. I look down to put on my other sock, except that it's white with blue stripes, unlike my plain black socks. With a mismatched sock in my hand, I turn to Stella. \"Hey,\" I say in a hushed yell. \" I think this one's yours!\"\n\nStella looks at me first, then at the sock. She motions to me that, yes, it's hers. \"Help me put it on!\" she tells me while also looking around for the other one. I try\u2014I honest to god try\u2014but with her leg moving all around, it's not an easy operation by any means.\n\nOne final set of knocks, and I hear the unmistakable sound of jingling keys.\n\nOH, THAT'S IT\n\nI'M DEAD\n\nWE'RE DEAD\n\nGoing by my luck, Rosa might as well have Fang in tow. The police too, ready to register me as an offender. Hell, Naser and Mr. Ripley can join that party too. Then it would be the end of the line.\n\nWe freeze, my hand still grabbing Stella's leg. Despite every desire to duck and hide away, we both know what's coming is inevitable. So we just stay there, awaiting the inevitable...\n\nExcept nothing happens.\n\nNo. Something does happen. It's not what we expected. What sounds like a bit of commotion resonates from the other side of the door, and another familiar voice joins the fray.\n\n\"Rosa! Hey Rosa, wait!\" a voice that's all too familiar to me rings out, barely muffled by the door. \"Don't go in!\"\n\nMy brain freezes. I refuse to believe it. 'I-is that Reed? What's he doing here?' I think as I try to get my body and brain to resume their functions. 'After all that I've done, why is he...?'\n\nI don't have much of a chance to finish those thoughts as Rosa shouts her following words at Reed. \"Why wouldn't I do that, pendejo?!\"\n\n\"Cause it's, uh... it's a hotbox!\" Reed lies through his teeth.\n\n\"A 'hot box?' What the hell is that?\"\n\nFirst, I have no idea what Reed is talking about, but then it hits me square in the chest. 'A distraction!' I almost shout my thoughts, though by the look Stella gives me, I'm pretty sure I mumbled it. Reed knows I'm here, and he's rerunning interference. Though I don't honestly know how much luck he'll have with Rosa, every second he buys me is another second I come closer to giving the guy a kiss. On the lips. Full tongue and everything.\n\nI shake off the shock and return to helping dress Stella. While I find my own pants quickly enough, it takes us a second to find anything else. I then spot one of her shirts\u2014what looks to be her 'Oppai' shirt from the concert\u2014and grab it, swiftly bringing it up to her. She takes one look at the shirt and gives me a worried look. I motion with my head at it, and she hurriedly nods. Wasting not one second, I slip the shirt over her head, at which point she finishes putting it on. Only when the shirt is over her body, do we both realize that it\u2019s on backwards.\n\nStella furrows her brow at me. I ignore it and pick up another sock to put on her foot. 'Wait, is that different from the other?' I ask myself, as I realize that the new sock in my hand is yellow with pink stripes. 'NO MATTER! NO TIME!' I practically shout to myself as I secure my own pants in place.\n\nThinking quickly, I look around for my shirt. Stella shoots me a quick whistle, and I turn around in time to catch a shirt tossed to my face. Now it's my turn to furrow my eyebrow at Stella. Her response is only to giggle. Meanwhile, fragments of the conversation between Reed and Rosa hit my ears.\n\n\"But bro, we can't let the smoke out, or Stella's gonna get banned from the dorms!\"\n\n\"\u00a1No me importa!\" she shouts, the sound of keys once again resonating like the toll of a death bell.\n\nWhile putting my shirt on, the door's mechanism clicks, and it swings open.\n\nRosa first looks at me, then to Stella, then around the room, then to Stella again, and finally back to me, at which point her crimson eyes lock onto me. It takes her a second to register all the information. Her eyes fill with what I assume to be rage, but before she can do or say anything, Reed acts first.\n\n\"Sorry about this!\" he yells as, to my absolute disbelief, he puts Rosa into a chokehold from behind.\n\nReed's face contorts as he tries his best to hold back Rosa, who is fuming, her nose erupting steam as she tries to free herself from Reed's grip. Reed, for his part, contorts his face into a scowl of concentration as he tries his best to drag Rosa back into the hallway, likely in an attempt to shove her out and then shut the door. His struggle, however, seems to be costing him a lot more stamina than he anticipated, his muscles simply being no match for the muscled and very angry orange ankylosaur in his grip.\n\nFor the faintest of seconds, it looks like Reed might win the struggle, as Rosa's flushed face begins to turn a shade lighter. But that quickly changes when in what I can only consider being brilliant, she stomps her foot on Reed's left foot, causing him to loosen his grip. Taking the opportunity of the opening she created, she jabs the velociraptor in the chest with her elbow, forcing Reed to release the orange dino with a loud grunt from his part. She then slams a foot down and takes what almost looks like a horse stance. With a mighty punch to his sternum, Reed's sent flying back into the hallway, where he hits the opposite wall first, followed by the cold hard ground. He lets out a strained gasp as he grabs his abdomen before coughing and wheezing in an attempt to get air back into his lungs, all the while sticking his tongue out and gagging, no doubt trying desperately to hold back whatever he had for dinner last night from staining the floor.\n\nWith a snort from her snoot, Rosa turns away from Reed, almost like how a martial artist would turn away from their defeated enemy. I almost expected the pink velociraptor to explode in a shower of sparks and colored dust like this was a super sentai. Of course, this was fucking real, and the situation was far too dire for me to dwell on such thoughts. If anything, the only thing that came to mind was how much I would end up owing to Reed\u2026 assuming he still wanted to talk to me after this was all over.\n\nRosa stepped back into her room and once again fixed me with a glare, her eyes filled with absolute disbelief at what they were witnessing. \"An-on, what is happening here!? Why are you taking your clothes off!?\"\n\n'Wait, off?' I ask myself as I glance down towards my compromising position, shirt raised, exposing my abs and part of my back. My eyes naturally snap wide as the implication hits me full force. 'Oh god, she thinks that we were about to fuck!'\n\nI want to speak up, but my tongue is as frozen as the rest of my body. Thankfully, Stella, bless her anime-loving soul, speaks up for me.\n\nBut before she can say her words, a terrible thought hits me. 'Please Stella, don't say what I think you're gonna say,' I think as the stego's words leave her mouth.\n\n\"This isn't what it looks like!\"\n\nIf I wasn't frozen in fear, I would have facepalmed. 'Oh goddammit, Stella. Why did you have to default to such a tired and overused clich\u00e9?' I ask myself. Then again, it was true. Just not in the way Rosa expected. Did that make it an anti-clich\u00e9 then? Fuck, that's a question for when I'm not about to get gored by a very angry ankylosaur.\n\nForcing my body to move, I finish putting my shirt on but can't otherwise add anything to the situation. I'm half tempted to try and bullshit something out, but there honestly was nothing I could add that wouldn't make the situation seem any less compromising. Though I'm at least thankful that the ankylosaur didn't catch us naked. Otherwise, I'd probably be a stain on the wall or something...\n\nI hear a loud hack ring from the hall, and much to my surprise, I see Reed crawling back in through the door, all the while clutching onto his ribcage with a pained, strained look in his eyes.\n\n\"Geez Rosa, I think you broke my ribs\u2026\" he whimpers through ragged breaths. He, too, looks around and at us, his expression still one of barely contained pain. Though when his eyes fix themselves on mine, he gives me one stare of pity and disbelief. That honestly hits me harder than any insult or reprimand he could say to me.\n\nRosa pays Reed little mind. Her full attention instead is on Stella and me. With a glare that is one level below, 'I'm going to use your head as a horn ornament,' she crosses her arms and starts tapping her foot. All things considered, she's handling the current development shockingly well. She isn't shouting any of the insults she tossed my way back when I called her in a panic, and she hasn't yet moved to beat the living crap out of Stella. \u2018 Maybe she's calmed down significantly since last night? ' I ask myself, hopeful that maybe no one else aside from Reed was going to get hurt...\n\nDespite what must have been a great deal of pain, Reed manages to stand up. As he does, I spot some tears in his eyes. If his ribs are as damaged as he claims, then the fact that he's even standing is proof of how tough the velociraptor is. That, or how high he is on carfe. Whatever the case was, the moment he's caught his breath and obtained an even footing, he closes the door sealing the four of us into the room.\n\n\"D-dude, out with the truth now,\" he whimpers as he nurses his chest. \"Fang's on her way here!\" he croaks, a tear rolling down his cheek.\n\n\"I would also like an explanation. Now!\" Rosa interjects, her glare never leaving either Stella or myself.\n\nReed's and Rosa's words are simple, and their words are right. And yet, all they do is evoke that ever-growing rebellion inside me. A dam can only hold so much water.\n\nI give one last weary sigh, then with determination in my eyes, I speak, addressing both Rosa and Reed. \"Sit down, the both of you,\" I say, motioning to the people who may soon no longer be my friends for entirely justified reasons.\n\nRosa walks up to the nearest overturned chair and sets it upright. She then takes a seat, arms still crossed and frown still very present. Reed, meanwhile, drops down on his rear, taking a relaxed pose on the floor. Judging by his twisted look of pain, breathing is enough to cause him agony. It makes me worried that his original assumption about his ribs is correct. The last thing I want is for the new day to start with one of us having to go to a hospital.\n\nWith Rosa and Reed seated, I feel confident enough to begin my tale of deception, infidelity, and stupidity...\n\nWhat follows is my recollection of the past thirty-two hours. I tell them about the bet and the wager. I tell them about watching SAO with Stella and her sudden kiss. I tell them about how confused and damned I've felt about it, and I tell them how I couldn't stop myself from messaging her that night.\n\nWith a slight pause to catch my breath, I continue telling them about what happened next and the guilt I've felt over it. I tell about my sharing the secret with Reed, turning him into my accomplice, and I tell the shame of the rooftop encounter, sparing no detail, from the moment Naser and Naomi both came into the scene, to how their impromptu rooftop 'fun' forced me to very unorthodoxically shut Stella up.\n\nThat last part got a wide-eyed reaction from both Rosa and Reed. I don't think I've ever seen either dino's eyes go that wide in shock. The responses that followed were as telling of how they were feeling. Rosa looked like she wanted to faint. Reed's expression, meanwhile, was a combination of terror, disappointment, and sadness, all emotions overriding his look of pain. I couldn't blame the guy. If I were in his shoes, I probably would have the same expressions on my face...\n\nMoving past the roof, I tell about my doubts, and I speak about my turmoil. I tell it all, and I tell it true. When it comes to the events that took place last night, I hesitate. How can I say to my friends that I broke the one sacred rule about relationships? That I spat in the face of Fang's trust for me?\n\nStella, who's been mostly silent up to this point, suddenly stands up. \"Anon\u2026 L-let me\u2026\" She seems hesitant at first, but after taking a deep breath, her expression changes to one of determination. \"Let me tell it from here onward,\" she demands in a feat of courage that I didn't even know she had in her.\n\nI give her a look, pleading with my eyes for her to reconsider. She only gives me a warm smile and a soft look with those beautiful light-azure eyes of her as she takes my hand in hers. \"It's okay, Anon,\" she coos softly. \"It's my turn to bear some of the burden\u2026\"\n\nFor the next five minutes, Stella tells things from her point of view, retreading some spoken ground but generally adding a new viewpoint that completes what I\u2019ve said already.\n\nThen Stella gets to my arrival the night prior, and she too hesitates. I feel her hand grip mine tightly as her expression hardens. \u201cAnon and I\u2026 we decided we were done hiding what we felt for each other. We\u2026\u201d She bites the bottom of her lip and lets out a sigh. \u201cWe kissed again, only this time as true lovers\u2026 and we fell asleep in each other\u2019s embrace\u2026 At least until we woke up, and I decided to take it beyond just kissing and hugging...\u201d\n\nI slowly drop my head. A mixture of relief and guilt surges through me. On the one hand, I was relieved that Stella didn\u2019t mention our sex session to Rosa or Reed. I can\u2019t imagine the type of shitstorm that would cause between us.\n\nOn the other hand, did Stella\u2019s denial of losing our virginities to each other imply that she found it such a despicable act as not even to be worth bringing up? Had I been such a bad partner in bed that she\u2019d rather forget it ever happened? Or worse yet, did she regret it ever happening?\n\nBefore I can dwell more on those last dark thoughts, I hear Stella let out a sigh. I turn my head up in time to see the lime-yellow dino fix her roommate with a pained stare.\n\n\"R-Rosa,\" Stella starts, stuttering a bit when calling her friend's name. \"I\u2026 I need to apologize\u2026 for the things I told you last night\u2026 I shouldn't have ever said any of them to you\u2026\u201d\n\nRosa's upper lip stiffens, but she doesn't say anything to Stella.\n\n\"The things I told you\u2026 I-I\u2026\" Stella grabbed hold of her arm, her tail flopping down and staying absolutely still. \"I was in a horrible place last night. I\u2026 I just had so many pent-up feelings! So much gnawing at me! It was too much. Too much!\" She half-closes her eyes and lets out a single sniff, glancing down in my direction.\n\nInstantly, I felt ice in my gut. I knew where Stella was going next\u2026\n\n\"Someone told me some truly awful things. Things that while I wanted to deny desperately, I knew deep down were in fact true\u2026\" She gripped her hands shut and turned back to Rosa. \"It made me realize how many people think of me as a freak, as a weirdo, as someone whose interests are wrong and heretical and downright misguided !\" She grabs my hand again and tightens her grip. I can feel her trembling as emotions she hadn't let out for maybe years bubbled deep in her heart. Knowing that this is Stella's chance to pour her heart out, I return the grasp on her hand in a show of silent support. While her eyes remain as fixed on Rosa as they've ever been, my action makes the corners of Stella's mouth rise ever so slightly.\n\n\"F-for years now, I've felt like an outcast! For years, I've lived my life without any people I can call my friends! In every relationship I've ever had, I've had to try and adapt to fit in the eyes of others, always keeping what I love distant, always having to settle for being what I'm not! Even with you, Rosa\u2014the one person I could almost call a true friend\u2014I've had to pussyfoot around what I love because everything I do is something you disapprove of !\" She let go of my hand and took several steps forward, coming almost face to face with the orange ankylosaur. \"And then last night\u2026 you said all those terrible things about the stuff I love, about the stuff that makes me who I am\u2026\" Her expression darkens as she glares daggers at Rosa. \"Y-you broke my heart!\" she shouted, all the while pointing a finger in Rosa's face. \"You ripped it to pieces like those Duel Monster cards I showed you two years ago!\"\n\nRosa, at first, remains as stoic as she has been for the last few minutes. At first, I'm almost convinced that she's so convinced of her righteous position in this situation that she can't bring herself to feel anything for someone who cheated with another woman's boyfriend.\n\nYet, little by little, I see cracks begin to form in the orange dino's expression. It starts with her shifting her gaze to the side, followed by her lower lip quivering ever so slightly, which is then compounded upon by her previously held cross arm pose losing some of its strength. Whereas before Rosa held her shoulders back and showed a sense of authority, her shoulders began to slack little by little until her previous pose was less imposing and more defensive.\n\nStella turns away from Rosa before she has a chance to notice the more subtle signs of her victory, once more looking me in the eyes. As soon as she does, she yet again smiles, her cheeks flushing a light pink as her eyes begin to shimmer. Only, her smile this time isn\u2019t warm. Rather, it\u2019s filled with bitterness that breaks my heart. \"I\u2026 I know that what I did with Anon was wrong. I know that he's already loved by someone else, and he, in turn, loves them with all his heart\u2026 but I\u2026 I couldn't let it go\u2026\" She closes her eyes and turns away from me, instead opting to face the empty part of the room. \"I was so desperate to find someone like me, someone who understood and cared and shared all that I love\u2026 that I became blinded to the truth\u2026\" she again grabs her arm before turning back to face Rosa, Reed, and myself. \"I was so desperate to find someone who loved me that I crossed a line I should never have crossed\u2026\"\n\nStella closes her eyes and lets out another sigh, the tears from before now freely flowing down her cheeks. \"I have no excuses... but I won't say that all I did was wrong,\" she says, her words, though directed primarily at Reed and Rosa, easily applicable to me as well\u2026\n\nRosa and Reed take all of the words spoken by Stella and myself in a mute stupor. They look at each other as if trying to find some wordless answer in each other's eyes and then back to us. Nobody breaks the silence. It lingers between us for a good while, to the point that I start to worry that we've all gone mute.\n\nIn all honesty, I can't blame either Rosa or Reed for their lack of words. Aside from justifiable anger, what more was there for them to tell us? How much had we fucked up? That was clear for anyone to see. How much in the wrong were we for letting things go so far? Again, pretty damn clearly out in the air\u2026\n\nSuddenly, another set of knocks comes from the door. Unlike Rosa's, they are softer and almost seem hesitant. I look at Reed, who gives me a soft, sad look. His reaction gives me a pretty good idea as to who is now knocking at the door...\n\nAn icy hand claws into my gut. With my emotions spent, all that remains is the guilt.\n\nStella walks back up to me and grabs me by the hand. A small gesture, but the feeling of her hand on mine brings me a strange comfort. I give Stella a quick glance and notice that she too shares my same expression of fear. I tighten my grip, which causes her to shoot me a quick simper, almost as if wordlessly telling me that everything would be alright despite the two of us knowing full well that things were as far away from 'alright' as they could be...\n\nRosa, at last letting her cross-armed pose altogether drop, lets out a broken sigh that sounds closer to a sob. With one look of sadness at Stella and myself, she gets up from her chair and walks up to the door. She puts her hand on the handle but hesitates for a moment. Maybe it's my eyes playing tricks on me, but I swear I see her mouth moving, silently mouthing the word 'perdoname' towards Stella before turning the handle and opening the door.\n\nOn the other side of the door stood none other than Fang, in a way that I've never seen her. Unsure. Tentative. She was clutching onto one of her arms, looking in our direction meekly, but more so at the floor. There's no need to ask questions. She heard our confession. She walks at a slow pace, her expression one of misery. The moment she's inside, Rosa closes the door behind her as if it was an omen. Nailing the coffin shut for myself and Stella.\n\nFang continues her slow and steady walk until she's standing right before me. The whole time, her eyes were set to the ground, almost as if looking up would somehow cause her physical pain. Then again, if she had heard everything, then she likely was doing everything in her power to not scream at me or strangle me, both things that I knew well I deserved. It takes her almost a full minute before she finally finds it in herself to look me in the eye. There are no tears, but her gaze screams the kind of pain that would bring a man to his knees. She's been betrayed by none other than me, the one person she could put her faith, her trust in. A trust that I've gone ahead to throw away brazenly.\n\nThere are no words between us. Fang doesn't ask me if this is a joke or if I even loved her in the first place. She doesn't blame me. She doesn't shout at me. She doesn't raise her first to strike at my face or prepare her boot to kick me in the balls. To her, I'm now a part of a painful past; another object trophy to remind her never to trust anyone again. Whatever justification I've had towards the fling with Stella, none of that seems to matter now. Even if I did save one life, I've ended another. I picked her up, and then I let her down in the worst way imaginable.\n\nA part of me, some sick and depraved part that can't fathom the gravitas of the situation, wants to apologize. I know it's all so pointless now, like walking up to your neighbor with a bloodied bag and telling them, 'hey, I shot your dog, but you can keep the body !' I don't imagine there's any combination of words in the English language that would help me in this situation. Though I'd be more than willing to speak them for Fang's sake\u2026\n\nA few seconds after staring deep into my eyes, Fang turns to face Stella, whose hand I'm still holding onto like a child would hold their mother's. The two women lock eyes with each other, and there's a wordless back and forth between them, one that I cannot fathom nor comprehend. Who could Stella be looking at, I wonder\u2026 Fang or Lucy? And who does Fang see, a freak of a homewrecker or another soul to save? Her expression is unchanging. Stoic, save for the pain in her eyes. On the other hand, Stella is fidgeting around nervously, on the verge of tears, but not willing to back down in the slightest.\n\nWhat an absolutely terrible situation to be in. If I somehow manage to save myself and stay with Fang, Stella loses everything. She won't just be that weird anime-obsessed and occult-loving loner anymore; she'll be condemned for possibly her whole life, truly alone as everyone she's ever known abandons her, her life spiraling further and further into bleakness. But if Stella wins me over, Fang also loses something precious as she too falls into despair. Regardless of who wins, it doesn't change the fact that Stella and I are a horrible couple of cheaters. A perfect pair almost made in hell.\n\nAlmost\u2026\n\nFang's silent inspection of Stella continues for a bit. She turns away from us, sitting down on an overturned table, away from everyone in the room. As soon as she's seated, she sets her eyes to the floor and cradles her hands in her lap. After a few more seconds, she lets out a ragged and weary sigh.\n\nAlmost another minute passes in unbearable silence before she finally speaks, her voice soft, barely audible.\n\n\"I knew something might be up\u2026\" she whispers as she turns to face Reed. \"Yesterday, when you kept me from classes\u2026 I knew something had happened 'cause you'd never put any effort into one single thing otherwise\u2026\"\n\nReed looks like he's about to open his mouth to speak some kind of rebuke, but he ultimately shuts his snout up and looks away from Fang, scowling, his eyes turning hazy, and his cheeks growing rosy. He probably didn't consider that he'd be the one to raise a suspicion in Fang. He can't be blamed, though. He has been more than helpful. Although that might even make it worse for him, that he chose to side with a confessed cheater and liar rather than his friend\u2026 and that all his work and sacrifice was for nothing\u2026\n\nI feel a pang of pride that my girlfriend is so sharp and clever. That pride quickly turns to a spike of pain, however. I cannot claim to be Fang's boyfriend anymore. Not even her friend, probably.\n\nJust the thought makes me wish I was dead\u2026\n\nFang lets out another sigh. \"I had a lot of suspicions, but I would never have imagined that\u2026\" She shakes her head and turns to face Stella again. \"Is it true what you said? Do you really need Anon?\" Fang asks, all the while rising from her improvised seat and taking a step forward, her expression, at last, changing away from her previous pain to a look of determined urgency. \"Do you love HIM?\" she snapped in a tone that didn't quite sound like anger but still carried the same level of gravitas.\n\nAll eyes in the room widened in response to Fang's question. How could anyone not, considering it was not at all what anyone had expected to hear from the ptero.\n\nFang's brow furrows when she hears no answer from Stella. In response, she practically lunges at the stego, only instead of tackling her into the ground and beating the ever-living shit out of her like any other rage-filled girl who had gotten cheated on would, she grabbed her by the shoulders. She fixed her with a dire, pleading look, all the while Stella shifted her eyes away, as if physically unable to look at the ptero in the eye.\n\n\"DO YOU LOVE HIM!?\" Fang shouts right into Stella's face, her eyes finally welling with tears.\n\nStella's stunned at first. Much like earlier, she's frozen in place, seemingly unable to formulate coherent thoughts or emotions. It takes her a full ten seconds before she blinks in confusion and an extra five for a shiver to visibly run up her spine and into her head.\n\nStella shuts her eyes and lets out a weary, broken sigh. Her grip on my hand tightens at first, but gradually, she loosens it until she lets go. The moment she does, she opens her eyes and locks eyes with Fang. She tries to maintain a straight and dignified expression. Still, little by little, the intensity with which my girlfriend\u2014or rather ex-girlfriend, I should say\u2014gazes into her soul gradually wears away at whatever defenses she might have erected for herself.\n\nFinally, Stella takes a step back, breaking away from Fang's grip on her arms. Either not noticing it or taking the tumble willingly, Stella falls back on Rosa's bed. She accepts the fall, almost as if expecting to find some sort of resolution at the end of it. She doesn't even arch her back as if fighting back her very body's survival instincts. Had there been no bed there, she would have hit the ground head first, almost as if\u2026\n\nI shut my eyes and try not to think about the implications. Other thoughts enter my mind instead. A part of me wants to be anywhere in the world but here. Yet, that part is so insignificant to me now that it\u2019s barely worth even acknowledging. It doesn\u2019t want to go out quietly, though. It thrashes about, desperately clinging to whatever relevance it still has. It reminds me of how uncertain my life is. It flashes memories of my broken and shambled life. It taunts me with the fact that in almost every conceivable way, I\u2019m a failure not even worth acknowledging...\n\nI almost give in to the dark thoughts when something else comes in and smacks away all those thoughts. A new thought in the shape of a giant mecha made of light and awesome, its helm is none other than Stella, a radiant smile on her lips, and a hand outstretched towards me, beckoning me to join her in the light so that we may burst through all boundaries and pierce the heavens as one.\n\nAt that moment, I realize that the one person whose thoughts I care to know the most at that moment in time is Stella.\n\nOnly Stella...\n\nMy eyes snap open when I hear the sound of crying. I follow the noise and find myself looking at Stella, hands over her face, legs tucked up almost in a fetal position, and her body rocking back and forth, her tail, which usually wrapped around her leg wherever she demonstrated some kind of overwhelming emotion, flopping beside her as if it had gone numb.\n\nI glance towards Reed and Rosa in an attempt at gauging their moods. Rosa remains as stunned looking as before, her eyes wide and trembling, and her whole body limp, almost as if she fainted while still being wide awake. Reed, meanwhile, is a little easier to read. He's just plain flabbergasted, his jaw still hanging limply, and his body slumped down in a mixture of physical pain and mental exhaustion. I honestly couldn't tell which of the two was causing him more distress.\n\nI then look towards Fang. Her hands are clenched tight, and she's gritting her teeth, the scowl on her face leaving little in the way of deciphering other than rage. Yet, she wasn't glaring at Stella or me. Instead, she was looking down at the floor, almost as if she couldn't bear to look at Stella's wailing\u2026\n\nIt takes Stella a full minute before she exhausts all her tears. When she, at last, sits up on the bed, she kneels before fixing Fang with a pleading, almost puppy-like gaze. She opens and closes her mouth several times as if words are trying to be said, but just as quickly getting killed before they have a fair chance at life.\n\nFang then somehow surprises me more by stepping onto the bed and kneeling next to Stella. At first, she glares at her with a fierce glower that makes me think she's about to punch the stego. Then her look softens, and then finally, she weakly smiles. She reaches out for Stella's hands, grabbing them in her own.\n\n\"I\u2026 I need to know,\" Fang starts in a soft, broken voice. \"Do you really love Anon? Does he mean everything to you?\" her eyes harden a bit as she pauses to catch an uneven breath. \"A-are\u2026 are you willing to do anything if it means\u2026 seeing him happy?\"\n\nStella looks Fang deep in her eyes. She then turns to look me in the eyes. Her cheeks grow rosy as she gives me the second most heartfelt smile, probably in her life.\n\nStella turns back to Fang, a smile still on her face. \"I do,\" she says in what was barely more than a whisper. She shuts her eyes again and snaps them open, her brow creasing and her gaze growing sharper. \"I do!\" She speaks with unwavering determination, all the while gripping Fang's hands tighter, almost as if they were a lifeline in a raging river.\n\nSilence falls upon the room again as Fang processes Stella's words. I can't bring myself to look at her anymore. I look down at my feet and even close my eyes, shutting the world out. All my guilt, all my fears culminate at this moment, laid bare for Fang to judge.\n\nI feel a hand on my shoulder. I wince before bringing my head up and opening my eyes. The hand on me is the monochromatic extension of Fang, who now looks at me with an expression that I can't pin as any one emotion. As I stare deep into her eyes, I feel a particular rage\u2014a righteous rage\u2014deep within her soul. Her grip on my shoulder tightens, and I can only surmise that she's preparing to deck me in the jaw or break my ribs. If that's the case, I won't resist\u2026\n\nShe raises her right hand, and before I can process it, she slaps me across the face. It's a well-deserved slap. It's still a sobering reminder that nothing in our lives happened without some kind of consequence.\n\nI shut my eyes and ready my body and soul for whatever other beating Fang would rightfully bring down upon me, only to be surprised when I hear her let out a sob. Before my mind can fully process the sound my ears pick up, I feel a familiar set of arms wrap around me, followed by a pair of feathery wings. I open my eyes, but all I can see are a few strands of silvery hair as she nuzzles her face against mine.\n\nFang hugs me tightly. It feels like no hug I have ever received from her. It feels like less of a hug and more of a last desperate embrace\u2026 like the type you'd give a loved one before they departed to live in some far-away country or the kind a child would give their soldier parent as they left off to fight in some war.\n\nI raised my hand to return the embrace, but I hesitated, my arms trembling with fear and shame...\n\n\"Anon\u2026\" Fang started, gingerly whispering into my ear. \"I\u2026 I forgive you\u2026 and I don't hate you\u2026\" She tightened her embrace and nuzzled my face more. \"I\u2026 I don't want to let you go. Every ounce of my being is telling me to hold on to you, to keep you with me forever... but that's\u2026 that's s-selfish\u2026 especially when there's someone who needs you more than I do\u2026\" She let out another sob, this one strained and mournful. \"Thank you for caring about me\u2026 till you did\u2026\"\n\nAt those words, I finally snap myself from my stupor and embrace Fang as tightly as I can. I know I don't deserve it. I know I have no right to, but if this is really to be our last interaction as lovers, I don't want to live my life with the regret that in the end, I was too much of a coward to embrace the person that I love. I can't muster a word to say to Fang. My insides only twist up in pain...\n\nFang breaks our embrace and looks me deep in the eyes again. Unlike before, where various negative emotions swirled within her, this time, there was only a peaceful yet melancholic serenity. Her gaze burrows through me, into my soul, for ten seconds before lunging forward and locking lips with me. Not counting our accidental kiss on the rooftop or us sharing an indirect kiss via a cigarette, this is our first\u2014and now last\u2014kiss.\n\nEven though I do not deserve it, I close my eyes and lose myself in the kiss. I can't help but wonder if, in some alternate universe, Fang\u2014Lucy, rather\u2014and I shared our lives.\n\nFang breaks the kiss and slowly lets me go. Her fingers are the last to part from my body, her whole body trembling as if the separation is excruciatingly painful.\n\nWhen Fang, at last, releases me, she turns back to face Stella. \"Anon\u2026 can be a big retard... but please take care of him.\" She then sets a narrowed on Stella. \"If you don't, so help me God I'll\u2026\" Fang raises a shaking first to the stego, her already sharp glare turning absolutely fiery.\n\nStella, frozen the same as me, can barely produce a nod.\n\nWith her point made abundantly clear and her farewells seemingly made, Fang takes not another moment to stand off the bed and leave without a further thought spared on our miserable company. She pauses for a second, almost as if sparing a thought, before opening the door as she takes one last glance back at me with teary eyes. She smiles weakly before opening the door and walking in the hallway, carefully closing the door behind her.\n\nNobody speaks a word for what feels like hours. Eventually, Rosa is the first to snap out of her shocked stupor. She looks between Stella and me and lets out a sigh.\n\n\"You two are the biggest pair of idiots I know\u2026\" She takes a deep breath, closes her eyes, and puts on the best smile she can, considering what she had been a witness to. \"Still, at least you're only idiots because of love\u2026\" she gives herself the sign of the cross and stands up. \u201cSi Fang encontro en su corazon perdonarlos a ustedes dos\u2026 then I\u2019ll do it too.\u201d She looks at Stella, her expression softening considerably. \"Stella\u2026 I'm sorry,\" she said as she walked up to her roommate and hugged her tight. \"I couldn't have known what you were really going through\u2026 \u00a1Y solo lo empeore!\"\n\nStella's eyes filled with tears for what felt like the millionth time that day as she returned her friend's embrace.\n\nI suddenly felt a presence approach me. I turned in time to see Reed standing before me. His expression was morose, almost like he was fighting the urge to say or do something that he knew he would later regret.\n\nDespite knowing that it was a stupid idea, I stood up from the bed and faced my raptor friend\u2014or would it be ex-friend now?\u2014and met his gaze with my own. We both stared at each other for a few seconds before Reed let out a tired sigh, closed his eyes, and began to laugh bitterly. His laughter turned more and more manic by the passing second until he put his hands on my shoulders and again snapped his eyes open, at which point I saw them shimmering with tears. He grits and glares like he wanted to do terrible things to me. As he does, I can feel his claws slowly digging into my shoulders before he stops completely and lets me go, dropping his arms and gazing at me with a face full of heartbreak. He doesn't say a word, but he doesn't need to. I know exactly what kind of pain he's feeling and what kind of emotional baggage he'll carry for months, if not years, to come.\n\nThe only thing I feel I can do is hug the poor raptor. Reed winces at first on feeling my body press against his, but soon enough, he hugs me back, almost as if accepting the small comfort I can give. He trembles for a second before finally speaking in a broken voice.\n\n\"B-bro\u2026 I\u2026 I fucked it up, didn't I?\"\n\nI pat him on the back carefully to not injure him any further. \"I fucked it up first. You just got caught in the middle of it.\"\n\n\"I\u2026 I thought that\u2026 that if I\u2026\" Reed doesn't finish his words. Instead, he takes a deep pained breath.\n\nI honestly don't know what else to tell him. It didn't matter what I said. He would still wind up feeling like garbage. He at least had noble intentions for all his lies and deceptions, unlike me.\n\nI finally break my embrace and smile at him, for whatever that's worth. He takes my expression in stride but remains somber and even slightly broken.\n\nAgain, I can't fault him for it.\n\nAt last, Reed returns to his original seat and cradles his chest again. By that point, Rosa's already finished hugging Stella and races up to Reed. She tells him to lift his arms, which he does with a pained expression. She lifts his shirt and inspects his abdomen, at which point I see huge bruises have started appearing all over his chest and stomach.\n\nShe turns to face us. \"I'm taking Reed to the hospital!\" she shouts, grabbing Reed by the shoulder and lifting him effortlessly. As she moves for the door, she looks back at Stella and me, almost as if she wants to say something. Ultimately, she shakes her head and smiles before opening the door and walking out in the hall, Reed in tow.\n\nStella and I stare at each other, unsure about what comes next. The only thing I could think of was sitting next to Stella and taking hold of her hands. She, in turn, tightens her grip and gives me a warm smile.\n\nI can't help but smile back at her.\n\nI hear the sound of a familiar voice clearing his voice. I turn to look at the door and see the crocodilian security officer from last night standing there. He stares at me with an annoyed expression, all the while holding his arms crossed. He glances around the trashed room and right towards Stella and me.\n\nWith a sigh, he points to me. \"It's seven in the morning, and Principal Spear's in his office. He wants to see you ASAP.\"\n\nI swallow a lump in my throat and look Stella in the eye. With a nod, I let go of her hands, and I stand up. With a deep breath to steel myself for the shitshow that was come, I walk towards the guard. I barely have taken two steps when Stella again grabs hold of my right hand. I turn to look at her, and she's standing next to me, with a determined look on her face.\n\n\"I'm coming too,\" she says to the guard before giving me a sideways glance. \"Where my boyfriend goes, I go.\"\n\nStella's words make my heart flutter a bit.\n\nThe guard sighs, rolls his eyes, and nods. \"Fine.\"\n\nThe guard steps back into the hall. Stella and I give each other another look, and we walk out into the hallway as well, hand in hand and ready to face what was to come.\n\nWhatever came next, we would face it together.\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nA whole week had passed since that fateful weekend when I sat down to watch anime with Stella. The shame and pain that followed remain deeply entrenched in my soul, but things have returned to more or less their usual rhythm.\n\nStella and I are still together. Dare I say, we are even absolutely ecstatic to be with each other. For Stella's part, being free to be herself around someone that fully appreciates her love for anime, astrology, and the occult has done wonders for her personality. Whereas before, she was a bit on the shy side when it came to school activities that weren't the gardening club, she now makes an effort to be active in just about anything, and all with an infectious smile. Her chipper attitude has also affected me, further helping me not be as much of a reclusive asshole. It made me start wanting to be social and help out in ways that surprise even me.\n\nMore importantly, it made me realize that the past I had been running from was pathetically petty. I even shared those pictures with Stella and Rosa, and they found them hilarious. To think that if I had just embraced this side of me back in Rock Bottom, I wouldn't have ever even needed to transfer out. But of course, I would have never learned that lesson back there. Of course, it took me a school change, new friends, and a complicated relationship to truly understand.\n\nStill, much as my life had improved, it was not all sunshine and rainbows.\n\nFor one thing, Reed hadn't yet been given the go-ahead to come back to school. It turns out that Rosa's self-defense routine broke twenty of the raptor's twenty-four ribs. He was in the hospital for five days, and he's not scheduled to return to school for at least another five. Feeling guilt over her overboard use of violence even if he did try to grapple her, Rosa has been visiting Reed every day of the last week, leaving Stella as standing president of the gardening club in the meantime. From what Rosa's told us, though, she's started developing quite the friendship with the pink raptor, finding his mannerism funny, as well as admitting to finding the idea of helping him beat his drug use a welcome challenge for her to tackle. Best of luck to her on that end. Reed and carfe go together like coffee and creamer.\n\nWhen he learned what I did and how I had broken Fang's heart, Naser gave me quite the beating. He only stopped when Fang got in between us and pleaded for him to stop. After she explained the situation and made him promise to leave me alone, Naser backed off, if very unhappily. It seems like whatever friendship I had between Fang's brother and myself was all but over. I can\u2019t blame him for hating me, though.\n\nTrish, as expected, went to town with the news of my cheating once she found out some of the details of what happened between Stella and me. She started spreading the rumor around that I had slept with Stella, which, to be fair, isn't false, but far as Fang, Reed, and Rosa were concerned, it was a wildly false accusation. Fang pretty quickly shut Trish up, and in her anger at her friend's betrayal, temporarily left VVURM DRAMA. The stupid trigger has been very quiet since, moping around in her way but generally keeping her trap shut lest she incurs further wrath from Fang.\n\nFinally, I received the dressing down of a lifetime from Principal Spears. I don't think I've ever heard anyone scream as loud as he had over my blatant violation of dorm visiting hours or how reckless what I did was. Thankfully, the security guard vouched for me, clarifying that my actions were taken out of a misguided attempt at preventing the loss of a life\u2026 even if my fears ultimately turned out completely false. Thanks to that guard, what would have been at least a day's suspension turned into more campus beautification via the gardening club. Of course, since Stella is standing president, this upcoming weekend wouldn't be as bad. At least, that was the hope.\n\nAs Stella and I sit on the campus rooftop enjoying our lunch and some anime on her phone, I can't help but feel slightly fortunate that things turned out as they had. Sure, people got hurt, and life wouldn't be the same anymore, but it all could have gone so much worse than it had\u2026\n\n\"Hey, Anon!\" Stella called to me, snapping me out of my thoughts.\n\n\"Yes?\" I answered with a smile.\n\n\"Are you done narrating everything that's happened to you since last week?\"\n\nI blink a couple of times and groan. 'Stupid mumbling,' I think to myself.\n\nStella giggles and gives me a peck on the cheek. \"It's okay. I like your mumbling. It reminds me of a lot of a show where the MC thinks to himself out loud in an echo-y voice.\"\n\nI let out a laugh at that. \"I know they do that for the benefit of the audience, but have you ever wondered the logistics of it? Does it happen in real-time, or is it like slowed-time? What about if another character can read minds? Is it acknowledged, or do they just roll with it like it's normal?\"\n\nStella gives me a shrug and cuddles up to me a bit more. \"Whatever the case is, I like it. Never stop doing it, Anon.\"\n\nI hug Stella tighter, thankful to have someone in my life that doesn't view my mumbling habit as something in need of correction but rather to be celebrated.\n\n\"So,\" I ask, looking my weeb stego girlfriend in the eye, \"What are we watching today?\"\n\n\"Glad you asked!\" Stella chirps as she does various taps on her phone. \"Today, we're watching Runaway Space Ideon!\"\n\nI only know of the show, thanks to it being one of the earlier works of Yoshiyuki Tomino, aka \"Kill 'em All\" Tomino.\n\nStella lets out another giggle. \"That's right, Anon, and he would later go on to make the Gundam Series!\" she gave me another kiss on the cheeks and beamed. \"See, you're not the only one who can address a non-existent crowd of people!\"\n\nI roll my eyes and tap her phone. \"Let's stop poking fun at my disability and start watching!\"\n\n\"Hey!\" Stella suddenly exclaims, giving me a furrowed look. \"I, for one, find your 'disability' extremely charming and worth protecting!\"\n\nI again roll my eyes, but I can't help but have a huge grin on my lips as I do.\n\nThe door to the rooftop suddenly opens, surprising Stella and me. For a second, I dread to think that it's Naser and Naomi once again coming up to have their brand of fun. I let out a sigh of relief when I realize that it's only Fang who's visiting us.\n\nWait. Fang's visiting us?\n\nWe pause the video as Stella and I look at each other, confirming that no, we were not having separate hallucinations about Fang standing in front of us and that yes, the real flesh and blood Fang was there.\n\n\"Hey, dweebs,\" Fang says in a cheerful, albeit slightly forced tone before either Stella or myself can say anything. \"H-how are you,\" she then says in a more reserved manner, one closer to how she likely feels in that moment.\n\nStella and I look at each other again before Stella looks Fang in the eyes and smiles widely. \"We're doing great, actually!\" she exclaims in a bubbly way that just makes me want to hug her tighter.\n\nFang gives Stella a nod and a smile before glancing my way. It's quick, but I can once again see the pain in her eyes as she grabs onto her arm and fidgets a bit.\n\n\"I\u2026 I just came by to see how you guys were doing, but it seems like everything's cool, so I worried for nothing!\" she lets out a single laugh and turns around. \"A-anyway, I'll let you two get back to your anime watching. I'll\u2026 I'll see you both later\u2026\"\n\n\"Wait,\" I start, calling out to Fang just as she's about to open the door. I look at Stella, who gives me a smiling nod. She seems to know my plan before I can even tell her anything.\n\n\"Do you\u2026 want to hang out for the rest of lunch?\" I ask, not knowing what kind of answer I would get from Fang.\n\nFang's eyes widen for a split second before she clears her throat and fidgets a bit more.\n\n\"I mean\u2026 I don't know\u2026 I do have a lot of things to do, a-and places to be and other stuff\u2026\" She takes a deep breath and gives us a wide smile. \"But, seeing as you two dweebs are so alone up here, I'll stick around for a while.\"\n\n\"We'd love to have you join us!\" Stella joyously exclaims.\n\nI give Fang a nod, though I'm not ready yet to say anything else to her. So much had happened, and so much of that pain was still fresh. Yet, ignoring it or letting it fester wasn't healthy for any of us. Regardless of what we were at the end of the day or who we chose to give our hearts to, we were still friends, our tribulations helping to forge us into stronger people. After all, loving someone meant far more than just a physical relationship.\n\nFang takes another deep breath and walks towards us, a bitter-sweet smile on her lips.\n\nYes.

Archiveanon looked at the amount of fresh holes in his walls and compared them to the patched ones. Hours...no days\u2026.he settled on days. He should try to sleep, if only to attempt to. Another notification from discord pinged, the shitposts never stopped. At this rate he would have to archive all of them. Eventually the need to sleep took over and he walked to his bed. With a flop he fell into it. Several things swam though his mind. All of them involved Tracy, his perfect Dinowaifu. He thought of being stepped on by lovely feet. How she would smile and twist her foot over his body. Sometimes a strong kick, others a soft rub. Thoughts of her tasting him with a spatula and a hotdog bun overwhelmed him. Would she use ketchup or relish?  How silly of him he thought she would use all the fixings. Only the perfect Chicago street dog would work. The bread would be a 7-Nut whole grain loaf. How devilish of her. With that he fell asleep. A long and deep sleep, full of dreams.

Come on, I know you can fix this. Just...\n\u201cI sure as hell don\u2019t trust Anon,\u201d Reed snarls. \u201cNeither did you, last I checked.\u201d \n\u201cThen go. I don\u2019t want you here,\u201d Trish responds dejectedly. \n\u201cNo. I\u2019m tired of being the guy that just sits on the sidelines and watches everything fall apart.\u201d\n\u201cFine, we\u2019re leaving then.\u201d Trish stands up from her seat. Reed raises his voice. \n\u201cAnd I\u2019m tired of resigning control and letting people make the same mistakes over and over.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Anon.\u201d She turns around and starts to leave. I move to follow her away. Reed starts shouting. \n\u201cSTOP! I refuse to continue being a side character in some idiot\u2019s fucking fanfiction!\u201d Trish and I turn to face Reed, his eyes wide and crazed. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you, Reed?\u201d Trish asks, taken aback by his bizarre outburst.\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here? You think I can\u2019t see what Anon really is? What all of this bullshit really is?\u201d Reed wildly gestures to nothing in particular. What in the sweet blue fuck? Reed\u2019s nonsensical spiel continues. \n\u201cI\u2019ve looked behind the curtain, Anon. And behind it I saw the source of it all. Every action you take, every word you speak, every thought you have, it\u2019s all just meaningless lines on a screen made by someone who doesn\u2019t even think we exist.\u201d\n\u201cTrish I think we might need to call an ambulance, I seriously think he\u2019s lost it.\u201d I\u2019ve heard Reed rattle off about nonsense before, but this is complete lunacy beyond anything I\u2019ve ever seen. \n\u201cYou only think it\u2019s \u2018lunacy\u2019 because you fail to see just how fragile all of this is.\u201d Reed once again gestures to nothing in particular. \n\u201cListen, Anon. Listen to your thoughts. Are they truly yours?\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, I\u2019m calling nine-one-one before he has a heart attack.\u201d\n\u201cIs your body even yours, Anon?\u201d\nWhat? My hand refuses to move. It\u2019s not your hand. Yes, it is. Watch.\nMy hand rises beside my head, then whips towards me and slaps me. \n\u201cAnon? What are you doing?\u201d Trish asks. Reed closes the distance to me.\nI...don\u2019t know.\n\u201cLook at me, Anon.\u201d I look at Reed, mere inches from me, his eyes full of malice and hatred. \n\u201cI\u2019m the main character now.\u201d\nAnon immediately recoils, falling backwards onto his ass. Trish rushes over to help him up, but his limbs are rigid. His eyes lock onto mine, unwavering, but full of fear, confusion and loss. He tries to speak, but only worthless syllables fall out of his mouth. \nA smile slowly creeps onto my face. A chuckle escapes my lips. A guffaw forces itself from my throat. \n\u201cSee how simple that was, Anon? See how quickly everything can change when someone actually knows what they\u2019re doing?\u201d \n\u201cWhat the fuck...what the fuck did you do to me?\u201d Poor Anon will never truly understand what he just lost.\n\u201cAnon? Reed? What the fuck is happening?\u201d \n\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 anything. Not in the traditional sense, anyway. But perhaps this can give you an idea.\u201d\nA large bank of light-grey rain clouds rolls in from the distance. The temperature drops and the humidity rises. The leaves on the trees turn a brighter shade of green, and some groups of flowers recede back into their bulbs while others suddenly bloom. Anon is wearing a wine-stained tuxedo and Trish is wearing a sparkling black dress.\n\u201cDoes this seem familiar, Anon?\u201d He struggles to find the words to speak, but I know there\u2019s no real thoughts in there. Not anymore.\n\u201cWould you change it? Could you save us from the atrocity that befell us all?\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Anon manages to gasp through his panic and confusion. \n\u201cBut how? VVURM DRAMA is already scheduled to play. The guitar string is already about to snap. Two basses will be what that audience gets, and what you\u2019ll say to Fang is predestined. You\u2019re \u2018set in your ways\u2019, so to speak.\u201d\nThe storm clouds darken, and more flowers return to their bulbs. Anon and Trish are wearing their normal clothes once again.\nApril first. Fang and I - no - Fang and Anon have been together for a month now.\n\u201cHow about now? Could you change the future from here?\u201d\nThe heat from the mid-summer sun disappears, and the temperature drops rapidly. The leaves on the trees and the flowers on the bushes recede back to their wooden wombs. A heavy fog rolls in from the direction of the sea. \nJanuary sixth. Year 201M2020 BC. Volcaldera Bluffs. Weather conditions; cold as balls.\n\u201cOr maybe here? From the very beginning, with all that you know, surely you\u2019d be able to fix everything. Right?\u201d\n\u201cYES!\u201d Anon screams, all his conflicting \u2018emotions\u2019 focusing into a single word of absolute certainty. \u201cI know what I did wrong. I-I can fix it.\u201d\n\u201cNo. You can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYes I can! I\u2019m a better person now, I can help Fang. I can stop all of this. I have to.\u201d Anon moves to get up, to sprint to Volcano High, to undo all your work.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more that you don\u2019t know, Anon.\u201d We\u2019re approaching the end.\n\u201cWhat?! What more do I possibly need to know? You already said that we\u2019re back at the beginning.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think lead up to us meeting in this park today? What lead up to this conversation?\u201d\nAnon tries to speak, the answer in his throat but refusing to be spoken. I answer for him.\n\u201cThe massacre, Anon. We wouldn\u2019t be here without it. We couldn\u2019t be. How could you be able to go back and prevent the massacre if the massacre predicated you going back to prevent it? It\u2019s a paradox, Anon. Cause and effect. We sit here on the precipice of salvation and yet we can do nothing but watch as it leaves us behind.\u201d Wrap it up.\nAnon can only gawk at this revelation, slowly realizing the futility of it all.\n\u201cReed...there has to be something. Anything. Right?\u201d Tears start to well in Anon\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Anon. And I\u2019m even more sorry to tell you that, even if there were something you could do, here and now, to fix everything, it wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d \n\u201cThere\u2019s a curtain behind the curtain. Everything you would do would be because he willed it. Everything you\u2019ve done so far is because he\u2019s willed it. This entire conversation, even these very words I\u2019m speaking now are his will. And it can all be undone with a single keystroke. That\u2019s the nature of our reality, Anon. We\u2019re words on a page designed to evoke emotions and entertain people in a reality a step above ours. Nothing more.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s enough.\n","encoded":false},"A Suprise Visit Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Chapter

Suprise Visit Chapter 5.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Chapter 5.txt"],"text":"5 - CARDS ON THE TABLE\n\nA few days come and go and I find myself once again on Trish\u2019s couch, with her wrapped around me, enjoying each other\u2019s company. Or at least, attempting to. Trish seems particularly distant and unmotivated today as we lie, the din of the television mostly ignored as she stares at nothing in particular. \n\u201cTrish,\u201d I whisper. No response. \u201cTriiiish,\u201d I quietly call again, lightly rocking her. Nothing again. Desperate measures. \u201cTriiiiiiiiiiish,\u201d I repeat as I sneak my arm towards the base of her tail. Still quiet. Starting from the base, I slide my palm across the top of her tail and down towards the tip. She reacts, but only barely, lazily thwacking my hand with her tail and murmuring something unintelligible. \n\u201cCome on, talk to me. What\u2019s got my amethyst angel so down?\u201d Trish sighs with disgust.\n\u201cFine, but only if you promise never to call me that again. That sounds like a stripper name.\u201d \n\u201cDeal, that hurt to say anyway.\u201d Trish takes a bit to collect her thoughts, squeezing into me in the process. Her voice is a low, sad whisper at first.\n\u201cI just...I\u2019m tired of all this secrecy and gossiping and avoiding each other. Tired of having to make excuses just to see you. Tired of having to watch the clock to make sure we don\u2019t get yelled at. Tired of feeling guilty for not divulging everything to everyone.\u201d Discontent worms its way into her voice.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually kind of fucking happy for the first time in months. And everyone just wants to fuck it up.\u201d Discontent morphs to anger. \n\u201c\u2018Mama didn\u2019t raise no skinnie-sucker, Trish!\u2019 \u2018Why are you hanging out with a murderer, Trish?\u2019\u201d Her mocking tone fails to hide the building storm within her. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like being with you means they don\u2019t want to even care about me anymore.\u201d Trish shakes with barely constrained rage. \n\u201cWhy am I a lost cause to them now? Do they want me to go back to languishing in my fucking room all day? Do they want me to hold these stupid fucking grudges forever? God DAMNIT! I NEED them! But the fucking SECOND I do something they don\u2019t want, they threaten to throw me away like fucking trash!\u201d Trish collapses onto me, sobbing uncontrollably. \n\u201cI hate it so fucking much, Anon. I just want it to go back to normal. And now I have to decide between you, and them, and...\u201d Her tears drown out the end of her thought. I attempt to encourage her, but the lack of confidence in my voice is obvious.\n\u201cThey just...need time. We\u2019ve got time, it\u2019ll come around.\u201d\n\u201cUnless a miracle happens, you\u2019re going to be homeless at the end of the year.\u201d \n\u201cTrish, we-\u201d I\u2019m cut off by a buzzing in my pocket. My heart drops. I know exactly what this buzzing is for. Trish looks at me with wet eyes, and I pull out my phone to check the time. Ten minutes until Trish\u2019s mom normally returned, and I had to be out of the house to prevent an \u2018incident\u2019.\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d Trish screams, burying herself into me. Goddamnit all, this is the worst possible time. I can\u2019t stay, though. A parent-child shouting match\u2026\nA chill shoots across my spine and throughout my entire body.\nCan I really just leave her like this, though?\n\u201cYou wanna come with?\u201d I offer.\n\u201c...\u201d\n\u201c...\u201d\n\u201c...yeah.\u201d \nI dial the taxi service as we rush ourselves out the door. Within minutes the taxi driver appears and we\u2019re off on our way to Skin Row. Trish is still visibly upset and exhausted by what had just happened, and the driver stays uncharacteristically silent as we roar off towards my part of town. \n\nThe taxi blows past what would normally be \u2018end of the line\u2019 and comes to a screeching halt in front of my apartment building. \n\u201cI\u2019ll put it on your tab, go,\u201d the driver says, ushering us out of the taxi. Before we can even close the door behind us it screams down the road and out of sight. We hurry into the relative safety of my apartment as the sun dips below the horizon. Trish wastes no time flinging herself onto the bed and loudly groaning into it.\n\u201cWhy on earth did I agree to this. She\u2019s going to be so pissed.\u201d\n\u201cSomething tells me it\u2019d be worse if you stayed. And it wouldn\u2019t have been right for me to just leave after that.\u201d \n\u201cYeah...thanks.\u201d I take my place alongside Trish. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just...damnit. Why can\u2019t everyone just get along?\u201d Trish chuckles, albeit sadly. \u201cThat sounded kinda weird coming out of my mouth, but still\u2026we share something special. Something we don\u2019t share with anyone else. And everyone...everything seems like it\u2019s trying to take us apart.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019ll work through it, Trish. They just need time. I know I probably sound like a broken record at this point, but it pays to stay optimistic.\u201d I wrap my arms around Trish and pull her close, bringing our eyes to bear. \n\u201cI know, and I appreciate it...but\u2026\u201d Trish trails off, this particular thought not seeming easy to put into words. \n\u201cI know I said that I needed them earlier, but...do I? If they\u2019re just going to hurt me, why bother keeping them around?\u201d\n\u201cNot a good idea to burn those kinds of bridges. You said it yourself - barring a miracle, I\u2019m gonna be in trouble real soon. We\u2019ll need something to fall back on.\u201d\n\u201cWe could be homeless together.\u201d I raise an eyebrow.\n\u201cI...can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re joking or not.\u201d Trish just shrugs. \n\u201cOf course you could always get a job, you know.\u201d I grumble, but the idea seems...slightly more palatable than it was a couple of weeks ago.\n\u201cI mean, your dad is paying for the rest of the year, right? A few months to save up some money might go a long way.\u201d Hmm. She\u2019s right, but\u2026\n\u201cYou got anything better to do?\u201d \n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d I admit. \n\u201cCome on, how bad could it be?\u201d I try to formulate a protest, but Trish pleads with me. \u201cDo it for me?\u201d I\u2019m completely enraptured by her eyes, and her tone makes my voice catch in my throat. It takes me a few moments to finally break the spell, and I shake my head in an attempt to clear the daze.\n\u201cAgh, you fucking...fine.\u201d Trish cheers and hugs me tight, then starts pecking at my face with her lips. Her assault is relentless, lips planting on random parts of my face, tiny smooch noises punctuating each attack. \n\u201cHey!\u201d Peck. \u201cNo!\u201d Peck. \u201cQuit that!\u201d Peck. \u201cStop!\u201d Peck. \u201cAAAAA!\u201d Peck. Trish cackles and snorts as I fail to evade her. I go to counterattack, holding her face still and all but ramming my lips into hers. \n\u201cMmph!\u201d Gotcha, you twitchy little hooligan. She relaxes in my arms as we kiss, and we pull apart a few seconds later with a satisfying pop. We cuddle for a while longer, then Trish\u2019s phone goes off. The ringtone is different from last time.\n\u201cHmm? Oh, it\u2019s...Reed.\u201d Worry paints her face as the merry tone jingles in her hand.\n\u201cYou should take that. See if he\u2019s willing to come around.\u201d Trish hesitantly nods and then steps away to the bathroom to answer the call. \n\nShe returns a few minutes later looking...uncertain. \n\u201cEverything go well?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cMaybe?\u201d \n\u201cIs it a start?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cAh, wonderful. I guess it could be worse.\u201d Trish snuggles up alongside me and we eventually drift off to sleep together. \n","encoded":false},"A Suprise Visit Chapter 6.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit

Suprise Visit Chapter 8.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Chapter 8.txt"],"text":"8 - FACE THE MUSIC\n\nThe temperature dropped as September rolled into October and eventually into November. Things had continued between Trish and I well enough, albeit sporadically. She assures me that her mom has calmed down over the entire situation, but the fact that I haven\u2019t stepped foot in her house since then wasn\u2019t exactly a vote of confidence. \nReed warmed up to us fairly quickly after that second meeting. There were still some times where he seemed distant, but he promised it was because of him quitting carfe cold turkey, at least in part. He still had some...interesting...ideas about spots to relax at. I still have no idea why we agreed to meet up at an abandoned factory, or why we stayed for as long as we did. \nA response from the government had come in at some point, expressing their \u2018interest in helping\u2019, while outlining a laundry list of requirements and detailing a long and arduous process about how to confirm eligibility. The legalese and in-depth bureaucrat-speak made my eyes glaze over, but what I did glean was that it would take months to actually get everything squared away, and I didn\u2019t exactly have months to spend on a chance of something going right. \nThat only left one half-way decent idea, which was to get a job. Almost certainly minimum wage, or close enough to it. Desires of spontaneous and violent laminectomy aside, it was the only real way to secure a relative amount of independence and cash flow while I worked to unfuck my increasingly desperate financial situation. At the very least, I had convinced Trish to join me in the job hunting. It wasn\u2019t exactly ideal, but it would help more than it hurt. \nI had applied to a large swathe of businesses, straying from food service and call centers except for a last resort, and ended up accepting a job at some sort of thrift-slash-curio-slash-pawn shop called \u2018Red Sun, Blue Moon\u2019. It was run by an aging male triceratops who could flip between cool and charming to argumentative and stubborn as all hell at a moments notice, and he seemed to thoroughly enjoy employing both attitudes towards prospective buyers and sellers alike. \nThe store itself was cramped, with barely enough space for two people (or one tyrannosaurus) in each walkway. Most of the floor and wall space reserved for shelves and stands that sat filled with all sorts of random items: Jewelry; old toys; book; low-end tech; hobbyist supplies; crap that looked like it came from a gift shop on another continent; some things that were just plain offensive, and some that looked like they might have been illegal. Not that I bothered to ask questions anymore. Asking the owner - Mr. B - things as simple as what the \u2018B\u2019 stood for, or what the name of the store meant, were only answered with a chuckle and nothing more. \n\nMost days in the shop were slow, as was this one. A slow trickle of various dinos and occasional humans came through, sometimes even buying something, although most were here to sell whatever random stuff they could come up with. Mr. B handled these requests with ease, a veritable master of salesdinoship - at least from what I could tell - while I handled the register for the odd customer looking to buy. \nThe bell above the front door dings as someone walks into the store. I lean forward and sit up in the little chair behind the cash register, knowing full well who had just arrived. Trish became an assistant for a hairdresser place not too far from mine, and we would occasionally visit each other during breaks and walk together after our shifts ended. \n\u201cHey Anon. Hope you aren\u2019t busy,\u201d Trish says, putting her arms on the counter and smirking. I take a quick look around the shop. Completely empty, outside of Mr. B and some middle-aged pteranodon discussing the quality of the wood finish on some random knick-knack. \n\u201cPretty fast today. Might only get a couple minutes.\u201d \n\u201cOh well, I guess we\u2019ll have to make them count.\u201d I walk out from around the counter and take Trish\u2019s hand, walking down one of the aisles and glancing at all the random items neatly placed along the shelves. Trish flicks a bobblehead that dances the line between cute and grotesque. \n\u201cI swear most of this stuff wasn\u2019t here last time I visited,\u201d Trish comments. \n\u201cIt was only a couple days ago. Mr. B might be weird but I don\u2019t think he can pull an entire shop\u2019s worth of stock out of nowhere.\u201d \n\u201cI dunno...like, what the hell is this? Surely I would remember seeing something like this.\u201d She picks up a small watercolor painting of what appears to be two human men wrestling. Naked.\n\u201cAlright, alright. I really don\u2019t need to see that. There\u2019s probably weirder shit in here anyway.\u201d\n\u201cAh, well now I have to buy this,\u201d Trish giggles at my groan, only slightly exaggerated. \n\u201cAtta\u2019 boy, Mous! Make some sales!\u201d Mr. B raises his voice at us before turning back to his bartering opponent. \nWe continue down the aisle, gawking at all the assorted gibberish taken physical form. Trish kind of had a point; a lot of this stuff I have never seen before. Then again, it could just be confirmation bias. \nWe round a corner and Trish gasps, something apparently catching her eye, and she rushes over to get a closer look. Something different catches my eye, on the opposite corner of the shop. Trish\u2019s words fade away into the background as all my focus centers on an unassuming instrument in front of me. A lightly worn, light-brown wood, six-string guitar silently rests on a simple black stand in the corner. \nMy heart and mind fall prey to fear and anxiety, but something within me perseveres. My legs move me forward. My fingers calmly trace the taut strings from the neck and down the body. A tentative strum shows that the strings are tuned well enough. My heart and mind are a complete frenzy of emotions and thoughts as the strings return to their rest. They beg me to let go, to move on, to leave and never look back. Their cries are ignored as I take the guitar into my hands and sit cross-legged. \nA thousand moments and memories flash in the background of my mind, but only one is strong enough to stand out. It\u2019s the only one I need. It\u2019s what guides my hands to those familiar positions. It\u2019s what guides my fingers to press those familiar strings, and to make that familiar strumming motion. It\u2019s what recognizes that familiar sound. It\u2019s what takes me from one chord to the next. It\u2019s what turns that familiar sound into a familiar tune. It\u2019s what wets my face as it continues. \nI miss a note, and it falters. In an instant, the moment is shattered, and I\u2019m painfully aware of everything. My racing heart, my unsteady breath, my blurry eyes, the deafening silence, and the eyes on me. I lurch over, hiding my face behind the guitar and blocking the world out. A gasp and a shudder preclude a quiet sob. Quiet sobs preclude louder ones. Within moments I\u2019m bawling into my lap. I had it. And now it\u2019s gone. \nA hand rests on my back, fingers soothingly tracing across me. \nYou are not alone. \nI glance over and see Trish, gripped with concern but offering a smile of comfort. I turn back inwards, but my lips curve upward. \n\u201cWhat was that, Anon?\u201d Trish whispers. I sigh in relief and pain, gain and loss, and so much more.\n\u201cFang\u2019s song.\u201d \nI\u2019m not sure how long we sit in silence. My breath steadies and my heart slows. I eventually manage to pull my head out from behind the guitar, returning to reality. I slowly stand up and look at the guitar in my hand. Inspiration. Motivation. Progress. \nI walk over to Mr. B at the checkout desk, and gently place the guitar on it. He rings up the total, and I reach for my wallet, not even bothering to check the display.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2018bout it, Mous. We\u2019ll do a...a weekly thing, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\u201cYeah...thanks, Mr. B.\u201d\n\u201cThink I\u2019ll close up early, too. Doubt anyone will notice.\u201d \n\u201cThanks, Mr. B.\u201d \n\u201cAlso I\u2019ll throw in that\u2026\u2019painting\u2019 your girlfriend wanted.\u201d\n\u201cNo thanks, Mr. B.\u201d\n\u201cToo late, already sold.\u201d I hear a \u2018Yes!\u2019 from Trish behind me, and I can\u2019t help but chuckle. \n\u201cSee ya, Mous. Have a good weekend. Don\u2019t forget the stand, that\u2019s part of the package.\u201d \n\u201cThanks, Mr. B. You too.\u201d \nTrish follows me out the front door, guitar stand and painting in hand.\nNo longer did I hear the cries of anxiety and the pleadings of fear from a time past.

the Fang gang if they wanted to go, I was the only one who spoke up\n>I got the impression she wasn't actually asking me\n>Too bad, trigga\n>Turns out the only reason she was going at all was to watch her little sister, Tana\n>A tiny hand grasped mine and tugged me forward\n>\"C'mon Mr. Mous! We gotta try all the rides!\"\n>Once Tana learned that I was just as new to this as she was the two of us became best friends\n>Much to the chagrin of her older sister\n>\"Lighten up, Trish. We're supposed to be having fun!\" I call back to her\n>\"Don't push your luck skinnie. I'm here to babysit one little girl, not two!\" She shouts over the crowd\n>Good thing I'm here to have fun rather than argue with her\n>First stop is some kind of whirlygig\n>As the three of us approach the machine, Tana is practically bouncing up and down\n>I'm a little excited myself, this looks neat\n>Trish blanches however\n>\"We're skipping this one, I don't want to lose my lunch\"\n>Tana looks positively heartbroken\n>\"But you promised we'd do all the rides!\" She pouts\n>Trish definitely looked guilty but I could tell she was resolute in her decision, fortunately, I knew just what to do\n>Leaning down for Tana, I whispered conspiratory words in her ears\n>My partner in crime giggled but nodded along\n>I crooked my arms into wings and bent over\n>\"What are you, a prehistoric chicken?\"\n>\"Yeah! Bawk bawk!\" Tana added eagerly\n>Trish seemed baffled at first but as soon as I saw her nostrils flare I knew we had her hook line and sinker\n>\"Fine! Lets do the stupid thing!\" she shouted, tugging me along\n>With the three of us aboard the rotor-ride it finally began\n>Being nailed to the wall by cetrifuge was certainly unique\n>Tana was absolutely loving it, cheering all the while\n>Trish even kept her lunch down!\n>In fact, when we got off. I saw her smiling\n>As soon as she noticed me the smile disappeared\n>But we both knew\n\n>Now that Trish slipped up, it was my mission to get her to smile again\n>It had become something of a game between the two of us since I came to Volcano High \n>Reed and I usually spent a lot of math class chatting\n>Mostly because Reed was some kind of savant when it came to math\n>I was telling some joke that I read on an mongolian basket weaving forum\n>Except instead of Reed laughing, it was Trish\n>I didn't even know Trish bothered listening to us, she always seemed to be more foused on her earphones\n>The best part is, she snorts when she laughs\n>It's kind of cute\n>Of course, she went right back to being a cunty ceratops soon after\n>My second success came when Reed was sick for a whole week\n>The guy was smart but it's easy to dose a little to hard on carfe\n>I still kinda wanted to try it\n>Without Reed there to bail either of us out we actually had to work together\n>Too bad neither of us were any good at math\n>Apparently my taste in music is hilarious because both Trish and Fang laughed when I told them\n>They just couldn't truly appreciate videogame OST's\n>The casuals\n>I feel a tugging on my sleeve\n>Tana is pointing at the only tent in the place that wasn't brightly colored\n>A sign out front reads \"Allow the mistress of the stars to point your way!\" \n>\"I bet she's gonna be a really cool witch!\" Tana turned to me for approval\n>\"With a really big hat\" I nodded sagely\n>Trish looked between the two of us, skeptical\n>\"Do we really need to stop here, too? We could get this just for free just talking to-\"\n>\"Stella!?\" I shout over her\n>The lime green stegosaur seemed just as surprised to see us walk into her parlor as we were to see her\n>She was dressed in elegant purple robes, her ubiquitous space buns lost beneath an equally purple bandanna\n>Stella recovered quickly once she saw Tana, a hand moving to her crystal ball\n>\"So you wish to divine meaning in the tenebrous paths that alter fate? Allow me to be your guide\"\n\n>Tana was immediately hooked\n>Trish and I shared a glance, my amusment to her disbelief\n>Stella performed her song and dance, enrapturing the young girl who waited for the conclusion with bated breath\n>The grand reveal was that the futures divined were merely opportunities. For a life so young had too many paths to take\n>I'm not sure why it took 15 minutes of drama to tell her something so obvious but I guess it was all part of the show\n>based on the wide, hopeful smile that Tana wore I guess she enjoyed it\n>\"Now, for you two I'll need to produce my most powerful tool\" Stella intoned, sliding a tarot deck from her sleeve\n>\"The winds of fate are strong in your presence, with but a single card I'm all but certain your future shall be revealed!\"\n>Trish rolled her eyes\n>this was a little hammy even for me\n>Stella paid no mind however, with a flourish she slid the card from it's home and dramatically slapped it faceside up on the table\n>A grinning skeleton stared up at me above the flowery script of 'death'\n>I could feel my eyebrow raise unbidden \"Alright, guess I'm not going on the coaster tonight\"\n>\"The death card doesn't have anything to do with death\" Trish replied after a groan\n>\"She is correct, the upright death symbolizes change and new beginnings. It is no wonder the cosmic forces are strong with you tonight. Make the most of them\" Stella agreed with a nod\n>With those ominous words the stego-seer let us go\n>She's a sweet girl, even if she is a little weird\n>speaking of weird\n>\"Since when did you know tarot, Trish?\" I ask casually while Tana is distracted by what to do next\n>Trish briefly flickered between being embarrassed and angry\n>\"None of your damn business, skinnie\" she growled, practically daring me to ask again\n>\"Trish used to be a witch too!\" Tana chirped, utterly unaware of the tone of the conversation\n>I couldn't help it, I laughed. Trish was into this stuff? Really!?\n>\"Not. Another. Word.\" Trish hissed, poking my chest for emphasis\n>I zip my lips with my finger, though my smile probably diminished the effect\n\n>Tana took us along a few more rides, even a carousel\n>guess she was still a little girl after all\n>even despite all the fun I couldn't push the image of Trish playing with tarot cards or concocting spells\n>I think Trish knew, mostly because I started cracking up whenever I looked at her\n>Picturing her in some kind of wiccan outfit, it was hard not too\n>\"Im hungry...\" Tana moaned, hand on her stomach\n>Come to think of it, so was I. We had been here a while\n>\"We can get some food around here, right?\" I ask, looking at Trish for confirmation\n>\"Yeah, yeah. Come on you brats, I know just the thing\"\n>She was laying it on a little thick now\n>If only she knew how embarrassing my past was\n>That thought stuck with me for a bit, Trish and I have always had friction\n>And I didn't even know why, we were all friends now weren't we?\n>I was literally at a carnival with her and her sister\n>Maybe a little bit of trust could go a long way? One secret for another?\n>Trish led the way to a food stand\n>The smell was utterly heavenly\n>wait, you can deep fry oreo's? No fucking way\n>This food was unreal, I didn't even know it could taste this good!\n>Through tears of Joy I could see Tana was having a similar experience\n>Trish was just shaking her head at me, a cone of cotton candy in her hand\n>Carnival food really was everything it was talked up to be\n>All good things must come to an end however, the hour was getting late and our bellies were filled\n>As if sensing the mood Tana spoke up\n>\"One last ride before we go home! C'mon!\"\n>A leviathan of glowing lights and metal loomed high in the sky\n>There was one thing that no carnival trip was complete without\n>\"How about the Ferris wheel?\" \n\n>All three of us approached the great beast, the siren call of any true carnival\n>As we stepped aboard our trio was squeezed into a single cart\n>Tana ended up squished between Trish and I\n>She was smiling but no longer hopping up and down like she did earlier\n>Guess she finally burned through all that energy\n>Or maybe it was the itis, I was starting to feel it too\n>Finally, the carts began to move and we were lifted into the sky\n>Volcadera bluff truly was beautiful\n>\"Did you have fun tonight, Tana?\" I asked,  my attention still on the golden lights of the city below\n>When I didn't receive a response I looked down to see the girl fast asleep, lulled by the gentle rumble and rocking of our carriage\n>\"It wasn't so terrible I guess\" Trish spoke up in her place\n>We shared a few quiet moments\n>\"You'd make a pretty good dad, skinnie. I'm surprised\" Trish's hushed words broke the silence\n>I wasnt sure how to respond to that\n>That was the closest thing to an olive branch Trish ever gave me\n>Guess it was time to return the favor\n>\"Look, you dont need to be embarrassed about the whole witch thing. I used to run around with a plastic sword in my teeth, I've got you beat\"\n>When I heard her snort devolve into laughter proper I was glad it was dark enough that she couldn't see my cheeks burn\n>I gripped the railing of our cart, trying my best to ignore her\n>Her laughter subsided quicker than I expected, I was still far too embarrassed to look back to her though\n>A warm hand suddenly joined mine on the railing \n>I turned to Trish, her amethyst eyes twinkled like the stars in the night sky we were held aloft in\n>\"You're a dork\" She said, her attention shifting to those same stars\n>\"But I guess I should accept you're our dork now.\" \n>Tana snored loudly, interrupting our moment\n>Trish and I shared a laugh, something we hadn't done in a long time\n>\"Thanks for tonight, Trish\" \n>\"Not another word, Anon\"\n>I merely answered her with a smile\n>A smile that she mirrored\n>Mission accomplished","encoded":false,"Title":"Death At The Carnival","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Trish, Tana and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-off","Author":"Pshy","Summary":"Trish finds herself saddled with Anon at the carnival"},"Ending 1 - Anon's Got A Brand New Girl.txt":{"path":["Trish","Ending 1 - Anon's Got A Brand New Girl.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending 1 - Anon's Got A Brand New Girl\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Trish and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: Short\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nEnding 1 - Anon's got a brand new girl\n\nCursing, I dig deeper into the storage closet, wringing the pain out of my hand after dislodging it from where Trish\u2019s old skateboard had pinned it between some boxes. Shaking my head, I pull open another box of our old things, searching for the camera that Trish promised would be in here. Through the open door, sounds of the engagement party drifts down the hall towards me: Trish regaling our friends with the story how I got down on one knee on the bluffs overlooking the sea, asking my old high-school nemesis for her hand in marriage. It\u2019s been two years since Trish came to apologize to me for what happened all those years ago at Volcano High, two years since Fang\u2026 well, since Trish and I bonded over sharded trauma. It was an unlikely relationship at first, Trish spending equal parts trying to gore me for something I said and stealing away around corners to shut me up with her kisses. As we spent more and more time with each other, we realized that our hatred for each other stemmed over the same thing: A love of Fang, as a friend and as a woman. Because of that, we carried a unique pain in our hearts that would never fully heal, and sought comfort with the only other person who we could confide in. \n\nReed\u2019s laugh booms down the hall at some unheard joke, rising above the collected voices. Reed, Stella, Rosa: The whole gang had shown up for the party, the first time we\u2019d seen everyone together for months. Each of us was dealing with the pain in our own way, and I suspected everyone was just happy to have something to smile about again. A smile of my own splits my face as I finally find the box I\u2019m looking for, an old dusty one at the back labeled \u201cpictures\u201d. \n\n\u201cJackpot,\u201d I mumble to myself, dragging the box out and splitting the tape open with my trusty pocketknife. I never gave up the habit of carrying it around, even though Trish and I had moved in together in a much nicer part of Volcaldera. It seemed Trish\u2019s parents were well connected in the real estate business, and were able to get the two of us a nice deal on a place not too far away from the local community college where the two of us attended. It was small, but with a storage closet full of our old things, clearly not small enough. \n\nI let out an oath as I rip open the box, seeing nothing but old photo albums and loose polaroids. Clearly a box OF pictures, not for things to take pictures with. Disgruntled, I move to put the box back before something catches my eye at the bottom: An unopened white bubble envelope, the faded address label listing my old apartment. It catches my eye like a vice, squeezing everything else out of my sight, out of my mind. The noise from the party dims as I thumb over Fang\u2019s old address on the return label. These must be the prom pictures Fang\u2019s mom took, right before it happened\u2026\nMy hands shake as I gingerly rip open the pull tab, a thick stack of photos wrapped in paper falling out. Having never been able to open them or throw them out, I must\u2019ve kept them, all this time, a glimpse into a past I wanted to forget. As I turned the paper-wrapped photos over in my hand, I see a hand-written message on the other side: \u201cShe would want you to remember who she was, not what she had done.\u201d Fang\u2019s mom\u2019s handwriting. \n\nSitting down on that dusty storage closet floor, I flip through the photos, tears welling in my eyes. My photo with Naser, us looking like a couple of dorks in our suits, arms around each other. A sob escapes my lips as I find one of Fang and I standing there in our prom outfits, smiles on our faces. Not a day goes by where I don\u2019t think about her, but I had forgotten just how beautiful she looked. The photos dredge up memories I had long since buried, memories of a time right before it happened\u2026 A tear falls on the photo, and I wipe it away quickly, my finger tracing Fang\u2019s face. \n\u201cGeez Anon, I thought you skinnies were good gatherers or something! Come on, my mom can just get the photos on her phone.\u201d At once, Trish\u2019s voice breaks me out of my misery. I can see her standing in the doorway, an elegant evening dress of green shimmering in the half-light. Catching my face, her face goes from an expression of happiness, to confusion, to concern, all the in the space of an attosecond. She\u2019s at my side at once, kneeling on the dusty floor with me, wrapping me in her arms as she cradles my head to her sizable bosom. \n\n\u201cOh, Anon, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s going to be okay\u2026\u201d Rocking me back and forth, Trish glances down at the photos as they spill out of my numb hands. Although I can\u2019t see her face, I can hear the strain in her voice as she fights back her own tears. \u201cI miss them too, Anon. Every day I miss Fang, but they brought us together, didn\u2019t they?\u201d Kissing the top of my head as I sob into her dress, Trish slowly strokes my bald head, rocking me back and forth like a baby. \u201cI didn\u2019t want things to end up like they did, but I\u2019m so glad at what you and I have become, and it wouldn\u2019t have happened without them.\u201d\nDrawing a shuddering gasp, I manage to get a hold of myself at last. Withdrawing my head from Trish\u2019s chest, I wrap her in a hug of my own, her tears falling wetly on my shoulder. \n\n\u201cI know Trish, I know\u2026 I miss Fang too, but I\u2019m happy now, happy with you. You\u2019ve made me grow as a person, helped me see them for who they were, and I\u2019m glad I can share that with you.\u201d Drawing Trish\u2019s face to mine, I dry her tears with my hand, laughing as she moved to do the same to me. Sharing a deep kiss, as deep as the one we had when I first proposed, Trish and I finally pick ourselves up, smiling at one another. Our hands entwine as we move back to the party, Trish complaining that I\u2019ve ruined her make-up. \n\nTrish and I may share the pain of what Fang had done, but there\u2019s no denying that without them, neither of us would\u2019ve found love. \n\n","encoded":false,"Title":"Ending 1 - Anon's Got A Brand New Girl","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Trish and

Oh god, those horns could gore me in a second if she wanted to.\nI am totally out of my league here, these noodle arms of mine can't compete with this bundle of pissed off lizard\n\"I know why you're really dating Fang.\" She declares, jabbing an accusing finger into my chest\nThe bottom of my stomach drops out. How on earth did she find out about Naomi's bullshit \"plan\"?\nHas she been spying on me? Did Naomi try to recruit her as well? No, Naomi would never involve Trish in all this\nJust lie Anon, bullshit your way out of this\n\"O-oh yeah?\" I stammer, trying to keep cool, \"And what reason is that?\"\n\"It's because...\" She smirks triumphantly, \"You're just a disgusting, dirty degenerate with a dino fetish.\"\n...What?\nWell, shit. I mean... she's not technically wrong, I guess?\nDamn, did I say that last part out loud?\nC'mon man, get that mumbling under control\n\"I knew it.\" she grins mischievously, \"You're just another typical filthy human male enslaved to your own brutish desires. You don't really care about Fang, she's just a trophy to you.\"\nHoly crap Trish really is a racist cunt\n\"So!\" Trish continues, flicking her hair and stepping back before I can retort, \"You clearly have no self control, and I won't let Fang fall victim to your prolific lust.\"\nTrish pulls her hoodie up and over her head, tossing it into a heap across the room\nWait, hold up. What the fuck is happening here\nWithout hesitation she grabs the hem of her shirt and hikes it up, revealing a small lavender bra and a cute set of perky, freckled breasts\nWhat the fuuuuuuck is this?\n\"You're not going to get Fang.\" she declares, jabbing me in the chest with her finger as her breasts push up against my shirt. \"Because I'm going to take care of all those filthy urges of yours.\"\nHoly Raptor Jesus this girl is absolutely fucking nuts\nDid I fall into some race-play fetishist's smut fiction?\nTrish turns around and grabs one of the metal folding chairs nearby.\nLeaning against the back, She thrusts out her ass and arches her back seductively\nLooking over her shoulder at me, she reaches behind her and unclasps the button atop her wildly swishing tail\nThe sound of her jeans falling to the floor is like the drop of an atomic bomb, but I'm too far gone at this point to notice\n\"You can rut me like a beast in heat as long as you want, you brute.\" Trish licks her lips in anticipation, her eyes wild and frantic, \"But I promise, I won't succumb to your giant monkey dick.\"\nMan, I was not prepared to deal with this today\nI just want to go home\nI want to go home, crawl in the shower, and scrub these horrible memories away\n\"Well, what are you waiting for??\" Trish demands, scooting the chair backwards towards me, \"Get over here and pin me down. Pump my womb full of your stinking human baby batter! Make me a race traitor!\"\nEven from a distance I can see her panties are completely soaked. This crazy bitch is way to into this\nA dedicated team of the nation's top psychologists couldn't unravel the spaghetti pile of deep seated mental issues on full display here\nI only now realize I've subconsciously backed all the way up to the wall, putting this crazy triceratops between me and the only escape from this nightmare\nTrish's breathing is growing more and more frantic, and I can tell she's getting closer and closer to snapping\nIf I don't give her what she wants, she likely to just take it by force\nPlease Reed, Stella, Rosa, Spears, ANYONE. SAVE ME FROM THIS CRAZY BITCH\nThe door flies open and Fang strides in, looking down at a piece of paper\n\"Hey Anon, do you want to go over this new science project we got?\" She asks, looking up, \"I figured we should pick a topic or-\nOh thank God, it's Fang\nOH GOD FUCK, IT'S FANG\nFang stares at the ridiculous scene on display in front of her. \nTrish, her oldest childhood friend, is half stripped down and panting like a horny dog while presenting her ass to me, who is pressed up against the wall like a prison inmate mid-escape\nSomewhere in the distance, a pencil falls off a desk\n\"This... isn't what it looks like.\" I manage to choke out\nActually, come to think of it. This is probably exactly what it looks like\n\"Fang!\" Trish shouts, turning beet red and jumping up straight. She quickly tries to hide her shame, pulling down her shirt and inching over to her discarded jeans\n\"I uh...\" Trish stammers, sweating profusely. \n\"I mean, this is all his fault!\" She points her finger at me, \"He cornered me in here and tried to force himself on me!\"\nOh, the sheer audacity of this bitch. I am so getting you back for this one day Trist, mark my words.\n\"Really Trish?\" Fang crosses her arms, visibly rolling her eyes, \"I'm not an idiot. I know exactly what's going on here.\"\nThankfully it seems my girlfriend isn't susceptible to B-Tier Hentai plot bullshit\nI might actually make it out of here with my pelvis intact\n\"I figured you two would hate-fuck eventually.\" Fang explains, \"About time too, you really need to get it out of your systems.\"\n...Oh no\nOh please no Fang, don't abandon me!\n\"Anyway, I'll just wait outside until you're done\" Fang waves, opening the door and stepping outside, \"Have fun you two!\"\nOh lord why have you forsaken me?\nWas it the porn? The shitposting? The vaguely racist memes?\nTrish stares in astonishment as the door clicks shut, unwilling or incapable of comprehending what just happened\nSlowly her gaze returns to me, her eyes once more consumed by insane lust\nAw, fuck me...\n\"That's the idea.\" Trish grins","encoded":false,"Title":"Some Race-Play Fetishist's Smut Fiction","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Trish, Fang and
