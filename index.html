It's difficult to pick up without breaking, but even if I could, I'm not sure I'd eat it. The banquet hall is bustling; nearly every single table is occupied by our friends and family sitting together and conversing. Lucy's parents, along with Naser, sit at a table not too far away. Stella and Rosa seem to be having a whispered discussion while the Latino eats Mexican food out of a Tupperware container. Hell, even Reed and Trish made it; what could be plausibly explained as 'steam' rises from that table in particular. Even people I don't know are here; Naser asked me to invite that girl in the wheelchair and the other human. Something about his 'one favor as the best man'. Everybody's presence in the banquet hall makes reality all the more painful; I can't help but let my sight drift over to an empty table, closer to the wall. It's lit brightly, as if a spotlight shines directly upon it, taunting me with the expectation of its guests arrival.\n\nThe words from the phone call dance across my mind. Both Mom and Dad said they'd be at the ceremony, but there's been no sight of them for the last several hours. Six calls to voicemail, a dozen text messages, and even an email yielded no results. I want to assume the worst; maybe they got into some kind of accident on the way. The possibility of something like that is almost none; hospitals tend to notify family when shit like that happens. I can't decide what's worse; did they forget about it, or did they just not care? My dad was always a bit reluctant about the whole dinosaur thing, maybe this is his fucked up way of saying he wants nothing to do with me now. The reasoning doesn't even matter. They aren't here, and that awkwardness tainted the air both at the ceremony and now. There's only one person that can overshadow the lingering pain; I lift my head up, staring at my newly-wed wife. Lucy was focused on eating right now; she really seemed to enjoy fish. Eventually, though, she glances up to me and our eyes meet. Her entire form shimmers in an enchanting manner, and I can't help but linger on her as she offers a shy smile.\n\n\"Uh.. Anon?\"\n\nI continue to admire Lucy as I whisper a quizzical \"Yeah?\" towards her. At first, she tries to do the same, and we engage in some kind of staring contest at the table. It doesn't take long until Lucy relents, though; an adorable blush paints her face as she looks down to avoid my gaze. I can't help but laugh quietly, and finally avert my own. As if to try and clear the air the odd situation, Lucy points at my plate with her fork, asking, \"You gonna finish that?\" I look down and realize I've barely touched it since we've sat down, and sigh. Cutting the fillet in half, I pick up one piece to the best of my ability and lift it into the air. Excitedly, Lucy pushes her plate forward, and I deposit the piece of fish onto it. She offers me the cutest \"Thaaaaanks~\" in response, and practically devours the meal in front of me. Even doing something as mundane as eating, the sight of Lucy makes my whole body flutter and instills a sense of peace in my soul. Leaning back in my chair with a content smile, I scan my eyes across the room to ensure everybody else is having a good time as well. For now, it looks like it.\n\nI can't help it. I look at the empty table.\n\nDisappointment, sadness, anger, disgust; all manner of negative emotions rise from my soul when I look at the table. They mix together with the euphoria that still fills me, forming a hideous bittersweet concoction that I can't process emotionally. My stomach churns, and I suddenly feel very ill. A bead of sweat runs down my forehead, and I dab it off with a cloth napkin. I think I'm going to throw up. Lucy looks up at me suddenly, her earlier smile replaced with an expression of concern. \"Hey, are you okay? It's not the food, is it?\" I shake my head, resenting the mumbling habit that I still haven't gotten over. I force a smile on my face, looking my wife in the eye. \"I- need to use the bathroom. Give me a 'sec.\" Lucy's concern seems to fade, and her smile returns, helping to dilute the nausea that fills my body. I stand up from the chair, whispering \"Excuse me\" to the tables that I pass before reaching the banquet hall doors. Stepping out into the hallway, I hang a left towards the bathrooms. The dead silence in this area of the building is comforting, at least for now. By the time I get to the bathroom, I no longer feel the urge to puke as I once had. My own disgruntled sigh breaks the silence of the hallway as I sit down on a metal chair close to a row of windows; I have a little bit of time to kill. I check my phone, and to nobody's surprise, not a single call or message has been returned to me. I take a deep breath, leaning back in the chair and trying to clear my head. This morning was the happiest I've ever been, and yet I'm here moping about my life in the middle of my own wedding reception. Trying to pump myself up, I stand rapidly and start walking back to the banquet hall. The doubts still linger in my head, but I march forward anyway, hoping they disappear. I round the corner and-\n\nStopping suddenly, I see Lucy's mother, Samantha, standing in the hallway facing me. She doesn't capture my attention very often, but I do notice how much meticulous care she's placed in looking.. pure. She doesn't turn heads, and no part of her appearance is overdone, but she still mirrors Lucy in her angelic appearance. I almost figure she's on her way to the bathroom, but as a few seconds pass, she shows no intention of moving, almost like she was explicitly waiting for me. In a polite voice, she speaks to me; \"How are you doing, Anon?\" I stomach my earlier feelings, rubbing my chin as I tell a bold-faced lie. \"I was.. just in the bathroom, didn't mean to make y-\" Samantha cuts me off in a concerned voice, \"You're not very good at lying, honey.\" I drop my shoulders, my explanation dismantled, and I genuinely don't know what to say to her. Not wanting to make Lucy worry, I clear my throat and let out a quiet \"Excuse me.\" as I pass the woman to go back to the banquet hall.\n\nBefore I make it far, a hand sternly grabs my arm. I turn around to look at Samantha; her kind smile conflicts with the seriousness of her stance. Our eyes remain locked as she utters words that I hadn't expected.\n\n\"Anon.. nobody can ever help you if you don't let them.\"\n\nTo my surprise, she lets go; I look down the hallway towards where the banquet hall doors are. Samantha shows no further sign of impeding my progress, so I could just leave, but her words ricochet back and forth in my head. I don't exactly know Lucy's parents too well, would it really be- yet, it seems like I'm closer to her than my own parents, both literally and figuratively. I close my eyes, a heavy sigh escaping my mouth as I turn back towards Samantha and let my shoulders drop. She continues to look at me with a familiar expression; one that I've seen many, many times before. I can picture my own mother in my head, looking at me with those eyes. Ones that were meant to bring me comfort. It didn't take me long to become distrusting of it; no matter what happened to me, she always said it would be okay. She only ever said it would be okay. Even in middle school, when I'd walk through the front door covered in dirt and bruises from relentless harassment, she'd just hold me by the shoulders and tell me it didn't matter, that everything was okay. So many of my younger years were spent in numb acceptance that suffering was okay, that sadness was normal, because it was always okay. I look into Samantha's eyes, desperately searching for that same sentiment of dismissive token support, so I could write her off as another manipulative, uncaring sociopath. So I could turn around and march back towards Lucy, forgetting about this waste of effort and letting her love wash away my worries.\n\nI couldn't find it. The traces of deceit that I learned so well identify were completely absent from her face. I sill wasn't sure what she was asking of me, but I knew for certain it was genuine. I lower my gaze and sigh as she continues to wait; not expectantly, but patiently. I drum up my inner thoughts and try to express them as genuine as I can, in words that I hope she understands. \"My.. Mom, and my Dad, they both said they'd be here.\" Samantha's gaze visibly furrows, expressing genuine sympathy as she slowly nods her head. I continue,  \"I've been calling and texting since before the ceremony.. I don't know if they forgot, or just.. don't care.\" Samantha takes a small step forward, expressing concern through her question; \"Are you sure they're alright? Perhaps something happened.\" I can only shrug at this question and reply, \"I think I'd know by now if that was the case.\" Samantha lowers her head again, pursing her snoot. I continue; \"I guess I've always an afterthought to them. I used to like the independence, but.. I don't think I'm even an afterthought now. But, even though they weren't.. the greatest at being parents, I still wanted them to..\" I let the statement fade out, as the disappointment and sadness grasp onto my heart again and send waves through my body. I glance at Samantha, and notice she's looking at me once again, with an expression I can't read. I must look pathetic right now. I bite at my lower lip while I await any kind of response from her, but she says nothing. Not that saying anything would help right now.\n\nSamantha eventually raises an arm, planting her hand on my shoulder gently. Her visage blooms into an uncontrollable smile as tears begin to bud at the edges of her eyes. I almost feel guilty for burdening her with my own problems, but this feeling fades nearly instantly as she pulls me into a hug. She clutches me tightly, as if she's afraid to lose me. It's only then that I realize how weak my legs feel; I've practically melted into her arms, and she begins to slowly rock us back and forth in a maternal manner, despite her size. She's keeping me standing, rather than the other way around. It almost feels like an out of body experience as my doubts and sorrows spill out into Samantha's boundless form of kindness and sympathy. A single tear rolls down my eye, which is all I can spare right now. This is in contrast to the several from Samantha; sobless tears that have begun to stain the shoulder of my suit jacket. Despite this, I can't will myself to let go just yet; Lucy must've gotten her ability to save my life from her mother.\n\nEventually, the strength in my legs return; I find myself able to stand normally again, and I begin to relax my body. Samantha senses this, and pulls away from me. She's no longer crying, but the tears still hover in her eyes; tears that she doesn't even bother to clear away as she maintains her gentle grip on my shoulders and looks into my eyes. I can't help but return the woman's gaze, and she speaks slowly in a gentle tone; \"A-Anon.. you'll always have a family in us. Don't ever forget that, okay?\" I can't help but smile, still locked into her gaze as I nod my head and mutter a sound of approval. She slowly releases me, reaching to her red choker scarf and undoing it, using it as a handkerchief to wipe her own tears. I opt to use my sleeve instead, like a barbarian. Following that small interlude, we face each other once again. She motions a hand ever so slightly towards the banquet hall. \"You should go in first, honey.\" I nod my head, appreciating the thoughtfulness. I walk down the hallway, reaching the banquet doors and offering one final gaze at Samantha, who smiles at me and waves her hand. Opening the doors, I step back into the banquet hall.\n\nTracing my steps back to my table, Lucy and I lock eyes as I'm about to take my seat. She looks happy to see me again, and offers a chipper \"Welcome back.\" as I sit down. I look at my own lukewarm meal, regretting not finishing it earlier. As I pick up the fish with a fork and take a bite, Lucy catches my attention with a look of concern. \"Anon? What's all over your shoulder?\" I have to finish chewing before I can answer her question, and I try to come up with a story that sounds plausible. Swallowing my fish, I start; \"Well, I was in the bathroom, and the faucet broke when I tried to turn it on. Shot water at me. I had to go let the reception desk know, sorry about that.\" Lucy looks at me with an expression of disbelief, but she eventually snorts. \"You've got to be the unluckiest person in the world.\" I can't help but smile and reply, \"I said the same thing, until I met you.\" A furious blush crosses Lucy's face, one that she tries to cover, but ultimately she just mutters \"Dweeb.\" \n\nMy attention is pulled to the banquet hall doors as Samantha walks back in, attracting no attention to herself other than me and Ripley. She sits down with the man, having some kind of whispered conversation. Suddenly, the large scarred pterosaur looks apprehensive; an expression that I haven't seen from him before. Samantha keeps pressing whatever they're talking about, and they both go back and forth for about a minute. Ripley eventually relents, reluctantly nodding his head in agreement to whatever they were discussing. I chuckle lightly, finding Samantha's ability to argue with someone that intimidating humorous. Looking around the ballroom, the rest of the guests seem just about finished with their meals, and the banquet hall is filled with even more quiet discussion with the distraction of food no longer present. I think about the near future, wondering if the rest of the reception will go well, even with the lack of my parents.\n\nSuddenly, something that I never expected in a million years to happen, happens.\n\nRipley scoots his chair back and stands up, catching the glance of practically everybody in the banquet hall. He looks around at first, then picks up a glass of wine sitting on his table and flicking it with a claw. The resulting twang of vibrating glass catches the attention of no more than him simply standing up did, and he stands there for a few moments awkwardly before raising the glass of wine. In a voice that is simultaneously gruff and nervous, he speaks.\n\n\"I'd- like to make a toast. To uh..\"\n\nHe turns towards me, and our eyes meet. The intruding thought that begs him to say \"ptero pussy\" won't leave my head.\n\n\"To you. Anon.\"\n\nRipley commands the attention of everybody in the room, and he continues his speech. \"I've seen a lot of people in my days. People that.. aren't good. People that refuse to fight their battles. People without the conviction to see things through to the end, that spend more energy looking for something to hide behind than they do trying to solve their problems. You, Anon.. you aren't that. Not only did you have the strength, so I've been told, to push through the adversities of life without giving up, but you had the.. courage, the empathy, to help my daughter do the same. For that.. thank you.\"\n\nRipley slowly sounded more genuine as the speech continued, but I hold my judgement. The entire banquet hall remains silent for a few seconds, but, of all people, Trish begins to clap enthusiastically. The pleasant surprise is met with the rest of the guests joining her, a light applause celebrating the speech. People begin to pick up their glasses, holding them in the air; Lucy and I do the same. My judgement is made. Ripley's booming voice fills the hall.\n\n\"To Anon!\"\n\nThe sound of clanking glasses fills the hall as everybody begins to toast each other. Lucy looks at me with an unwavering smile as we toast, mentioning \"I've never heard my dad talk like that.\" We drink. To me, to our marriage, to happiness, to family, to love. Idle chatter fills the hall afterwards as everybody excitedly discusses their thoughts and opinions with each other. I check my watch; dinner was supposed to end at five, but I'm sure fifteen or so minutes don't matter. I spot the reception director, motioning him over. His attention catches me, and as he approaches, I ask if we could just start the dance now rather than make people wait. He considers it, and nods with a smile.\n\nWithin five minutes, the lights have been dimmed, and blue lights illuminate the dance floor. Every guest stands, and we make our way towards the floor; I watch Reed as he hops onto the ramp in front of the DJ setup we had asked for. I wouldn't have any other man behind that desk. The reception director claps, catching everybody's attention. \"As is customary, the newlyweds will take the first dance, then the floor will be open!\" Everybody looks towards me and Lucy expectantly. I've been dreading this. The director signals reed, stepping away from the crowd. As Reed fiddles with the sound equipment, the gentle clatter of plates and silverware fill the air as the wait staff clean up the tables. Lucy grabs my hand, squeezing it as she whispers to me. \"So, you memorized the dance, right?\" I can practically feel my forehead getting hotter and hotter; I reply, \"I.. think so.\" She sighs, flustered. \"Just.. I'm leading, so follow me, dork.\"\n\nGentle music plays through the banquet hall's speakers as we step out onto the dance floor and command the attention of the entire room. I silently pray that I don't mess anything up too bad as Lucy begins to lead me through a waltz. The moves are a flurry in my mind as I do my best to follow, but it's not easy. She doesn't seem to mind, though; I try not to think too hard about the crowd for fear of missing a step and screwing the whole thing up. We dance like this over the course of a minute, the classical music continuing to grace the room. Knowing what's coming next, I'm excited. If I memorized anything about this dance, it's the cue.\n\nThe track hits a certain orchestral sound that we both recognize, and I place my arm around Lucy's head as I prepare my strength for what comes next. The lull in the music fades out, and lurch forward, catching myself in a kneeling stance as Lucy holds onto my hand with one arm and lets the other flourish. A near perfect dip, and as I begin to guide her back onto her feet, the familiar sounds of saxophone fill our ears. The transition into Bill Withers' gentle soundtrack goes off without a hitch, and I have only Reed's basic audio editing skills to thank for it. The lights themselves change, with the set of blue lights turning off and more purple-ish ones turning on; I watch as Lucy's figure is suddenly covered with luminescent markings that make her quite literally glow. Her beauty removes any sense of nervousness from my head, and we transform into a more traditional slow dance as we both forget the crowd even exists. Over the next three minutes, we hold each other, drifting around our castle in the sky in pure happiness.\n\nThe song fades, and we finish our dance towards the center of the floor. We break positioning, keeping our hands held together as we face the crowd and bow.\n\nThe applause completely rejuvenates me, and we slowly step off the dance floor as the lighting returns to normal and Reed begins to play a separate track.\n\nOver the intercom, a voice states, \"The floor is now open.\" I watch a few people, including Rosa and Stella, step up to begin slow dancing; Samantha seems to be trying to convince Ripley to. Trish even approaches Reed, and the two walk towards the floor together; I'm not sure if the display is platonic or romantic, but either way, I can't help but smile. Trish even notices me, and returns the expression before stepping onto the floor. For the first time, no attacks against the triceratops touch my mind. Lucy taps me on the shoulder, and as I turn my head, she looks genuinely happy. In excitement, she grabs me, wrapping her wings around my back and pushing her lips into mine in an incredibly warm display of affection that catches the attention of a few lingering guests. We hold each other for several seconds, locked in this kiss. As we pull away, she looks at me tenderly, and then quickly transitions into excitement as she yells.\n\n\"AAAAAA THAT WAS PERFECT ANON\"\n\nI never want this to end, but eventually, it does; she releases me suddenly, whispering a quiet \"HOLD ON\" as she moves past me towards both her mother and father. I watch the trio hug each other at the same time, the excitement shedding off of Lucy and infecting both of her parents. Watching them chatter amongst themselves begins to tug the smile from my face; I can't help but think about Mom and Dad. I shrug to myself, though; I have everything I need here, in this banquet hall; friends, family, and my newly-wed wife.\n\nAs I stare at Lucy and her parents, Samantha glances over towards me, and we lock eyes briefly. After a few moments, she looks back towards Lucy and her father, excusing herself. Neither party seem to mind as she disengages from the group and approaches me. I smile towards her, taking a few steps forward myself. She eventually stops in front of me, with a sincere smile painted across her face; an expression I can't help but mimic. She eventually manages to speak. \"H-Honey, you two.. you were beautiful up there. You.. You're an amazing man, Anon. Don't let yourself forget that.\" I look away in embarrassment; the words of praise aren't ones I've gotten used to hearing. The smile never leaves my face, though, and Samantha gently plants a hand on my shoulder. Understanding the sign, I take a small step forward and we pull each other into a hug. The wounds won't heal overnight, but the bond we share has begun the long process of wiping the scars of the past from my heart. We both pull back, and Samantha turns her head to look at Lucy and Ripley. The two seem to be locked in their own hug, one that likely mirrors ours, one of familial love and connection. Neither Samantha nor I can suppress a smile at the sight, and as we turn back towards each other, Samantha quietly states, \"Let's give them a minute.\" \n\nI watch Samantha stare out at the couples slow dancing on the floor. I assume pleasant memories fill her head, moments from previous weddings, perhaps even her own. Eventually, she turns back to me, slowly raising her hand. \"Say.. honey. Would you.. mind if-\" My words interrupt hers. \"We dance?\" I watch her smile grow as she nods, almost sheepishly. I can't help but laugh as I gently take her hand.\n\n\"Sure, Mom.\"\n\n\n~END~","Title":"A New Family","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Naser, Samantha, Ripley, Trish, Reed, Rosa, Stella and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"A Special Suprise.txt":{"path":["Anon","A Special Suprise.txt"],"text":"Title: A Special Surprise\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Trish, Reed, Rosa, Stella and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\npost ending 4 marriage\n|\\\/|\n\n\nAnother tiring day at work,I pull up to our little home that Fang and I where able to buy with our hard earned money, with the \"help\" of ridley of course.\nIts not perfect by any means, it definitely has its flaws,exterior paint needs to be redone, fence needs to be rebuilt properly, and the lawn has seen better days for sure but id rather be out here than living in that shit hole that is skinrow.\nI fish the keys out of my pocket and insert them to the door, giving it a gentle push as i make my way trough the noisy door,giving it another gentle push to close it as i hit the light switch, and in that instant\n\nFang,Trish,Stella,Rosa,Reed:\"Surprise!\"\nIn that moment i just stood there looking utterly dumfounded, words escaping my mouth,Confetti raining down on me.\n\nFang:\"Happy birthday Anon!\"\n\nTrish:\"Happy birthday you monkey!\"\n\nRosa:\"Feliz cumplea\u00f1os An-on!\"\n\nReed:\"happy birthday bro~\"\n\nStella:\"A happy birthday to you anon!\"\n\nAnon:\"wh-wha? me?\"\nnice going anon\n\nFang:\"Well,yeah who else idiot\" a small chuckle escaping her\n\nTrish:\"Fang mentioned that you've never celebrated a birthday before,sooo we thought 'why not throw one for him'?\" she said as a small smile brewed on her face\n\nRosa and stella pull fang to the side and whisper to each other, fang giving a nod to both of them as they take a turn into the kitchen.\n\nCuriosity waves over to me, as I'm about to start making my way to the kitchen I am stalled by a mildly toxic puff of smoke,halting me on my tracks as I start coughing, I look over to see the pink velociraptor with his 'science equipment'.\n\nReed:\"whoops my bad amigo, didn't see you there\"\n\nof course you didn't\n\nTrish:\"Reed! we went over this! you cant be doing that here! fangs parents drop by every once in a while you know that!\n\nReed:\"trish its fine, it hardly leaves an odor right anon?\" he remarked,giving me a small wink \n\nAnon:\"Riiiiight\" my words having absolutely next to no confidence as i imagine the potential devastation fangs dad would impose onto me\n\nReed:\"Still bro i cant believe you've never celebrated your birthday before\"\n\nTrish:\"Yeeeah, i thought you sknnies celebrated that like a ritual or something, whats up with that anon?\" curiosity waning in on her eyes\n\nAnon:\"well i never really bothered with that stuff you know?

I still sleep on the same side of the bed, knowing that it would be wrong to do anything else. Shuffling under the covers, I reach over to turn off the lamp, glancing down at the picture sitting there: A picture of myself and Fang, when we first found out we were expecting. I make sure to look at that picture every night before I go to sleep, careful to look nowhere else on that wretched nightstand. Over the past few days, it has become a talisman of sorts, protecting me from what lay within the drawer below.\n\n\u201cI miss you so much, babe.\u201d\n\n\u201cPfft, dweeb, I\u2019m right here.\u201d\n\nI freeze, my hand on the knob of the lamp.

I used to indulge these thoughts at first, when they started a few weeks ago. But I know better now.\n\n\u201cDo what, dweeb, hug you? Can\u2019t a wife give her loyal, loving husband a hug after a long day?\u201d The hug gets tighter, and I can feel her body pressing into my back. \u201cHere, let me at least rub your shoulders, get some of that tension out.\u201d Her hands knead into my shoulders, slowly working out the knots and\u2026\n\n\u201cNo!

Finally, another day of school over with. Trudging laboriously up to my shitty apartment, I fumble the keys out of my pocket. How the hell had Fang convinced Spears to let her out of sixth period this semester? She could\u2019ve at least waited for me, her damn boyfriend, before heading off. I know she\u2019s got her own stuff going on, but it would still be nice to see her after school. I push open my apartment door, dumping my backpack on the floor before a voice nearly sends me out of my skin.\n\n\u201cHey Anon, what\u2019s up babe?\u201d It was Fang, a mischievous look in her amber eyes. Her quick peck on my cheek in greeting left me fumbling for words like an idiot, still too stunned at her sudden appearance in my apartment. How long had she been here?\n\n\u201cJust stopped by to grab my guitar. Left it here by mistake, and I\u2019ve got a jam sesh with Trish tonight.\u201d The words tumbled out in a flood, Fang nearly tripping over herself to explain what she was doing. As she hoisted her guitar case up, I could see her face was flushed, her beathing labored. \u201cI\u2019ll catch you later, okay?\u201d \n\n\u201cY-yeah, y-you too.\u201d Nice fucking going Anon. My eyes flicker over to my computer screen, a sinking feeling opening up in my stomach. Shit, did I forget to clean up today?\n\nFang laughs, giving me a quick jab on the shoulder before pulling the door open. \u201cYou gotta work on your mumbling dude. Anyways, laters!\u201d\n\nThe second Fang left, I fly to my computer. How could I have forgotten to delete the browser history this morning?! Ever since Fang started dropping by unexpectedly (thanks Naser, for getting her a copy of my key), I had been diligently making sure to hide my power-level as much as possible: All Saturina wallpapers archived and deleted, all anime torrenting paused, all browser history deleted every day before school. But today\u2026 I had been in such a rush to leave, I had forgotten all of my careful steps to isolate my weeb-side from my girlfriend. It was bad enough she had seen those photoshops I had made last year; no way she would stick around if she thought I jerked it to anime titties and was downloading the entirety of K-On! off of my usually Scandinavian basket weaving forum!\n\nI tried to keep my heartbeat down as I jammed my password into my computer. Fuck, how could I have told Fang that as well?! Here we go, finally. Now, to open my trusty copy of FlintFox, navigate to the browser history, scroll down aaaaand\u2026My hand froze, the blood in my veins turning to ice. Not only had I not deleted my browser history, but Fang had also totally seen it! Entries from last night littered the screen, threads from all my usual boards mapping out a list of Fang\u2019s snooping. Video Games, Anime & Manga, Mecha; They all painted a clear picture of my desperate neetdom, and Fang had seen it all. I slumped back in my chair, unable to tear my eyes off the screen. Cradling my head in my hands a thin wail began to escape my lips. It was over.\n\nWait a minute\u2026. The last thing I had checked out, a tasteful \u201cIs food bad for you?\u201d thread, WASN\u2019T the last thing that was viewed. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to re-focus on the screen, delving deeper into just what Fang had been looking at. It seemed she had done a little digging into how much of a hopeless loser I was, checking out the anime board first, the threads ranging from normie-tier Dino-Ball-Z discussion (Rosa\u2019s influence) to shitty slice-of-life harem shit (Stella\u2019s hand, no doubt). From there, she migrated over to Mecha for a bit, checking out some imported models from Japan that I made sure to save for later viewing. A shitpost thread or two on Video Games kept her interest for a bit, and then\u2026\n\nOh.\n\nOh no.\n\nShe had found the pink boards.\n\nRandom; Politically Incorrect; Cams & Meetups. It was like a who\u2019s-who of desperate internet losers. Nothing on each of those boards seemed to keep her attention for long, thank goodness, but I couldn\u2019t help my mind from spinning out the worse case scenarios for each board. How would Fang tolerate a wrecked thread? A meteor-dodger one? What about the porn? Surely Fang couldn\u2019t have missed those, they were all over the place!\n\nThe more I scrolled up, the worse it got, however. It seemed Fang not only found the porn threads, but found a LOT of them.  Big titty threads, big ass threads, anime porn threads. Reading the evidence of Fang\u2019s discoveries, I couldn\u2019t help but begin to wail again. If she thought this is what I looked at all the time I was on the computer, I was fucking finished. I could almost hear her dad storming into my apartment, his golf-club raised high with murderous intent after Fang blabbed that I spent my time jerking it to shitty nudes. Or maybe it would be Naser, setting out to do more than just shove me against some school lockers. I wanted to bury my face in my hands, close the tab, pull the plug; anything to avoid facing the truth of what happened. But still I continued to scroll, digging myself a deeper grave with each little spin of the wheel.  \n\nThank Raptor Jesus on his cross of rock I forced myself to keep going.\n\nFrom the entry-level pink boards, Fang had turned her search in a decidedly more erotic direction. LGBT became Handsome Men became Sexy Beautiful Women. Page after page and thread after thread of softcore porn rolled on, no one thread keeping Fang\u2019s attention for very long. From there, it was over to Adult GIF. From the look of my browsing history, she must\u2019ve visited every single thread on that board! My rictus of fear slowly gave way to a shit-eating grin as I investigated further. The usual threads \u2013 Blowjob, YLYL, Amateurs \u2013 were on the list, none really catching Fang\u2019s eye, until at last, Fang had found her holy grail: Human-male-on-dino-female. \n\nEvidence of dozens of threads flowed by, hundreds of images providing detailed evidence of Fang\u2019s depraved fetish. From the looks of things, she must\u2019ve opened every single image she could\u2019ve found, and from the timestamps on each they were open for a while. Suddenly, her flushed face and mischievous look made more sense. So that\u2019s what she had been doin! With a wicked grin, I grabbed my phone, pulling open the messenger app, intent on a little revenge.\n\nAnon: saw what u were doing ;)\n\nAnon: tonite u wana see the real thing?\n\nA brief pause, and then Fang\u2019s response sent my phone buzzing.\n\nFang: OMG yes please <;V","Title":"Fang And Anon - Anon's History","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Anon And Fang - Dude Weren't You Married.txt":{"path":["Anon","Anon And Fang - Dude Weren't You Married.txt"],"text":"Title: Anon And Fang - Dude Weren't You Married?\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nI stand there, keys held limply in my hand, the door still closed in front of me. The longer I stand here, the longer I can pretend everything is okay on the other side of that door, the longer I can keep things together.

Better to face it now.\n\nThe ley turns, the door opens, the universe passes on, totally uncaring. The slow mechanical nature of life mocks me in my moment of tragedy.

I should be glad the hiss is gone.\n\n\u201cNo, Fang, please, you don\u2019t understand! I don\u2019t feel that way, I promise!\u201d A lie.

But not for long.\n\n\u201cNo, Fang, really I DO want to work on this, please! I love you babe, I promise.\u201d She lets me hug her, my face buried in her hair. She does not hug back. I hang on, wishing, desperately wishing, that I could stop her. \u201cPlease say it back, babe. Please say it.\u201d Pleading now.\n\nA long moment passes before she moved me away, not unkindly. \u201cI love you too, Anon. But I have to go.\u201d Words stilted, face composed, eyes crying. Fang moves past me now, my body too numb to stop her. The suitcase rolls on, out of the apartment. She pauses in the doorway. \u201cI\u2019ll text you later.\u201d I don\u2019t bother to respond.

The only thing that matters is Fang and I, and our new baby girl about to be born.\n\n\u201cRemember the breathing hun,\u201d I grimace, imitating the exercises we both learned in lemaze class. \u201cIn, and out; innnnn, and oooout.

Fang gives another ear-piercing shriek, her hand tightly clenched in mine as she screws up all her energy for one final push.\n\nAt once, the most wonderful sound in the world hits my ears: A tiny wail, one that starts off slow and quiet, but gains in strength as it continues. The cry of a newborn baby; OUR newborn baby. \n\n\u201cThere we go, she\u2019s out! Ten toes and fingers, good, good. Congratulations you two, she looks totally healthy.\u201d Quickly handing our most precious object in the world to a nurse, the doctor snips the umbilical cord with practiced ease. I glance up at Fang, brushing her hair out of her eyes as tears of happiness begin to streak down my cheeks. The strain of childbirth has taken its toll on her: Fang\u2019s hair is a mess, slick with sweat and plastered to her face, and her amber eyes are half-open from exhaustion. But still she smiles, that same soft smile she\u2019s shone me so many times before.\n\n\u201cLet me see her,\u201d Fang sighs, reaching out a hand slick with my blood towards the nurse. \u201cLet me see my sweet baby girl\u2026\u201d Her voice is eerily quiet. I expected Fang to be hoarse from the scream, but this\u2026 No, something else is wrong. Fang\u2019s eyes flutter shut, her outstretched hand slumping to the bed. She looks pale, as if the very spark of life within her is fading fast. Somewhere, the sharp staccato of a hospital alarm begins to blare. \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s ruptured! Quick, get her into surgery!\u201d The doctor parks orders to the nursing team, moving quickly to wheel Fang\u2019s bed out off the room. \n\n\u201cFang? Fang!\u201d The nurse wrapping my hand with gauze restrains me as I fight to get to Fang. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t leave her! I WON\u2019T!\u201d I try to rip my arm free, but the nurse\u2019s grip is an iron bar. Elsewhere in the room, our newborn continues to cry out for her mother, but I pay her no mind. Right now, all my thoughts are focused on my wife.  \n\n\u201cSir, please, you have to stay calm!\u201d Another nurse takes my other arm, pushing me back down into the uncomfortable hospital chair. I catch one last glimpse of Fang through the doorway before she\u2019s wheeled down the hall. She looked so small, so helpless, like a fragile doll that\u2019s been thrown against the wall. Hot tears begin to spill down my cheeks, tears of anger and sadness and everything else that should be absent from this special day.\n\n\u201cFANG!\u201d I manage to free my arm at last, reaching out my own blood-slicked hand towards the only woman I\u2019ve ever loved as she is wheeled away from me, forever. \n\nA life for a life.

Good job, Anon. You are better at this than I expected.\u201d\nYou closed the door to the storage-room, as Tracy took care to inspect every corner of her counter-kitchen. It was a bit of a surprise that the orange-colored dinosaur lady owned a restaurant herself, even if it was little more than a hole in the wall. Her place had a counter with seven bar chairs for seats pressed together. Behind the counter itself was the kitchen itself; the stove, a deep frier, slots for vegetables and meats, and a spot to place dirty dishes on. Further into the place was a table with two seats squeezed into the corner, and on the right side the entry to the toilet as well to the storage room where cleaning utensils were stored and the mentioned dishes washed. Needless to say, your first days were hot, quick, and difficult. It could\u2019ve been worse, according to your boss. The after-school hours were mild compared to the rush hour when customers needed a quick bite before returning to whatever jobs they had.

You really should get that looked at.\u201d\nYou one-handedly massaged your face in embarrassment as you walked outside. You were done for today, and since Tracy was more religious than most people, you had tomorrow off as it was a Sunday. No school, no papers to work on, you were pretty much free to do whatever you felt like. With a groan, you placed your hands on neck, taking in the street your workplace resided in. It was not far from the bazaar-esque place where you got your pet-roomba. Before moving to Volcadera, tomorrow would\u2019ve been a perfect set-up for you to slack off, but now it felt\u2026 awful. Boring. No homework to finish, the others had their practice, even the consoles didn\u2019t appeal much to you at the moment.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then why not stick with me tonight?

The waiters won\u2019t ask any questions.\u201d\nYou felt like this was utterly irresponsible of her and said such.\n\u201cAw, c\u2019mon! What\u2019s life if you haven\u2019t spent a night or two drunk with friends? I promise you will get home safely. See?\u201d, she laid her left hand on her chest and lifted her index and middle finger in a crude imitation of scout\u2019s honor, mock-seriousness evident. \u201cCook's honor! Whaddya say?\u201d\nFor a moment, you wanted to say no. On the other hand\u2026 you did make friends by stepping out of your comfort-zone. Naser, the band, Rosa, and, to your own surprise, Stella, you would\u2019ve faded into the background if they haven\u2019t forced you into the front.\n\u201cAlright, I guess? Where is this bar?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not far, just a short walk.\u201d\nAnd with that, she started taking off. For a moment you stood behind befuddled before chasing after her.\n--- 15 minutes later ---\nThe bar was nothing fancy from the outside. A mix of various east-asian cultures, it served drinks in a vaguely japan-styled environment. Lesser beings would have thrown conniptions over the cultural appropriation or whatever, but you had to admit you liked it, somehow. Bamboos sprouted in pots, the tables were separated by paper-walls, and each table had a small pit in the center. You wondered what was up with that. But through the power of weeb and anime as well as deductive reasoning, you figured that they kept sake warm in these pits. Which you didn\u2019t really expect, with how the wall behind the center-counter was stocked with little else than western alcoholics. Where was your boss anyway?\nYou looked around the bar, trying to find the orange lizard that paid for your flat. There she was, waving with the same enthusiasm she cooked her servings with. You waved back to signify that you saw her, and slowly made your way over.\n","Title":"Anon Meets Hot Single Moms","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Tracy, Trish's Mom and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Anon, Sam, Ripley - Hello, Misery Department.txt":{"path":["Anon","Anon, Sam, Ripley - Hello, Misery Department.txt"],"text":"Title: Anon, Sam, Ripley - Hello Misery Department\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Ripley, Samantha and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nThe ringing of the phone sounds muffled to my ears.

Summer isn't far off, the last cool days of spring are long gone. I'm already starting to sweat, and the day has only just begun. I jump up the concrete steps in front of Volcano High, eager to get inside and enjoy the air conditioning. The front lawn is strangely deserted, only a couple dinosaurs still lingering outside. It takes my sleep deprived brain a couple seconds to remember why. This is the first day of estrus week. I remember a couple announcements were made over the intercom last week, reminding students and teachers that half their class would be absent for the next ten days or so. Apparently everyone was already used to this routine, there weren't any special assemblies or classes to attend, which unfortunately left me out of the loop. All I really knew was that some of my female classmates had been steadily trickling out of class, and now all of them would be staying home for the coming week. According to Trish, this was because the 'patriarchal institutions insist that women are too emotional too blah blah blah...', I honestly just tuned her out after a while. I at least know better than to believe all those stupid stories that circled around my favorite Bavarian yodeling forum. It will probably just be a week of half-assed classes held by bored teachers projecting documentaries or holding 'open study sessions'. \n\nI stepped through the front door, dodging a thrown ball of paper and turning down the hallway to my locker. Despite the less crowded halls, the noise inside seems somehow louder than it usual does. There's half as many voices, but they all seem to be shouting and yelling. I can hear lockers slamming in the distance, as well as other loud noises I can't identify. There's a faint smell too, like somebody hooked up the gym lockers to all the air vents. I can't help but feel tense, like everyone is watching my back as I walk by. I'm not sure what's going on, but there's an undeniable undercurrent of tension is the air just waiting to snap, my instincts screaming at me to stay on guard. I open my locker in a rush, quickly grabbing my bag and heading to class. \n\nJust as I think I'll get there without incident, I feel the floor tremble beneath my feet. I narrowly jump out of the way as an enraged triceratops charges past me from behind, his massive head and horns held low. At first I think he's after me, but he keeps running down the hall, slamming into another triceratops coming from the opposite direction. I can feel the impact reverberate in my bones as they collide, I'm surprised neither of them broke their necks doing that. They hardly seem fazed at all, continuing to slam their heads against each other. Their horns lock, their feet sliding across the linoleum as they push against each other like bulls. A crowd quickly forms around the two fighting linebackers as I try to scramble away, students cheering and shouting as they jostle to get a better view. I escape from the crowd and head down another hallway, determined to get away form that mess. I can hear the shouts of the crowd grow louder as I run, the fight no doubt inciting it's own set of brawls amongst the audience.\n\nJust as I think I've gotten clear, a blue and green blur of tails and feathers bursts from around the next corner and slams into the lockers. Two velociraptors roll around in a tight ball of flashing claws and pulled feathers, their jaws and tails snapping back and forth. I press my back against the far wall and slowly inch past, giving them both as much distance as I can before breaking into another sprint. What the flying fuck is going on? It's like everyone has gone crazy and reverted back into bloodthirsty animals. This couldn't be because of estrus week, could it? I thought that only effected females? Now that I think about it though, a horrifying hypothesis comes to mind. If all the female students are in heat, does that mean all the male students are in a rut? Am I trapped in a school with hundreds of enraged, testosterone mad dinosaurs?\n\nI don't belong here, I need to get out. I start heading for the principal's office, planning to talk to Principal Spears. He's human after all, so he should still be sane. I can ask him to be excused from my classes until things calm down. Heck, I'll take the stack of homework and assignments all the female students got sent home with last week if he really wants. Anything to get me out of this madhouse.\n\nThe unmistakable sound of animalistic violence grows louder as I approach Spear's office, but that's starting to be true for the entire school at this point. Everywhere I look students are squaring off with each other, or already in the midst of some kind of fight. Nothing however, compares to the scene of absolute carnage in front of Spear's office. It looks like half the senior class decided to besiege his front door, all the largest predators and herbivores pushing and shoving past each other to get closer. In the center of the melee is Principal Spears, bellowing like an enraged god atop a pile of knocked-out and subjugated students. I duck out of the way as he tosses a velociraptor aside like a ragdoll, the other dinosaurs charging in heedless of their numerous defeated comrades. I don't know if Spear's position marks him as some sort of alpha to all these testosterone fueled nutjobs, but it's clear I won't get a chance to talk to him today. I quietly slink away before anyone can notice me, resigned to just get through the day. I just need to keep my head down, not make eye contact, and stay out of everyone's way.\n\n\n\n\nThe first half of my classes are a nerve wracking disaster. The students have at least enough self-control left to sit in their seats, but the thick aura of impending violence is inescapable. Sitting behind a desk is torture, my instincts screaming at me to run away and escape from all the dinosaurs sitting around me. More than once, an exasperated teacher is forced to pull two students away when a brawl breaks out in class, the inciting incident as casual as a misplaced glance. Out in the hallways, chaos reigns. I sprint from class to class, dodging snarling carnivores and dueling herbivores. The noise is deafening. Ankylosaurs slam their clubs against  lockers, pterosaurs screech at each other, and everyone is shouting insults and challenges. The cafeteria is only slightly better, if only because the intercom announced anyone caught fighting during lunch wouldn't get any food. Nobody forms a sensible line, everyone simply charging in and shoving each other out of the way as they snatch whatever food they possibly can. I'm nearly crushed between two large brontosaurus students as I grab the nearest sandwich I see, escaping from the mob as quickly as I can. At least with half the student body missing, there's plenty of room to sit as far away from each other as possible. I spot Reed sitting alone at our usual table, remarkably unscathed despite everything that's going on. He's waving me over, a big grin on his face, and I can't think of a good reason to sit anywhere else.\n\n\"Hey Anon!\" He smiles as I sit down, his own lunch halfway gone already, \"You hanging in there alright dude?\"\n\n\"Hey Reed, good to see you're still sane at least.\" I reply, getting my first good look at the sandwich I grabbed. Lettuce and tuna, great. \"Yeah, I'm surviving. Just about.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know it can be tough.\" Reed chuckles, unaware just how big an understatement that is as an empty lunch tray flies through the air behind him, \"At least you're keeping your head down. You should be fine.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah?\" I ask, warily checking over my shoulder for the millionth time today, \"Why is that?\"\n\n\"Cause you're a human, moron.\" Reed replies with a smirk, \"Most people are only interested in their own species today. Just don't look anybody in the eye or piss them off, and you should be fine.\"\n\n\"Is that why you're not trying to claw me to death?\" I ask, earning another laugh out of Reed as I take a reluctant bite of my sandwich.\n\n\"Nah man, I've got my own remedy.\" Reed smiles, waving his thermos in the air. That explains a lot, Reed is just too stoned right now to be an angry hormonal maniac. I never thought I would say it, but thank God for his insatiable drug habit.\n\n\"Well that's a relief.\" I sigh, running my hand over my head, \"Wait, so how do you avoid fights? You don't look like you've been mauled yet today.\"\n\n\"Oh well...\" Reed laughs, \"The others guys don't really see me as part of the 'competition', you know? They don't have to worry about me, so they leave me alone.\"\n\nWait, what the heck does he mean by that? I feel like there's an implication here that I'm not quite grasping. Why would Reed not be considered a threat by the other students?\n\n\"You know...\" Reed continues, his voice dropping into a husky tone. He bats his thick eyelashes, looking me in the eye with an uncomfortable intensity. His tail lazily sways in the air behind him, the feathered end fluffed up to it's fullest. \"If you wanted someplace to hide, I know a couple spots where nobody would find us~.\"\n\nHis hand slides over to mine, our fingers intertwining together. I jerk my hand away as everything suddenly clicks into place. Why Reed wouldn't be considered competition by the other males. How he could hang out with two girls for years and not date either of them. Why he is staring at me now with a debaucherously 'come-hither' expression.\n\n\"Dammit Reed, not you too!\" I shout, grabbing the last of my sandwich and sprinting out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nI've nearly made it. I just have one more class to get through, then I'm home free. Unfortunately, it's the one class I've been dreading most all day: gym. The packed locker room is practically a ticking timebomb of impending violence, the smell even worse than usual. I bashfully decide to change in one of the toilet stalls, just to avoid literally getting caught with my pants down. Luckily nothing happens, if only because everyone anticipates an opportunity to settle their differences soon enough anyway.\n\nEveryone files into the gymnasium, shoving and elbowing each other out of the way. I can feel the hot breath of the dinosaur behind me on the back of my neck, the the joints in his fingers popping as he clenches his fists. Oh sweet Raptor Jesus, if you get me through this, I'll swear off porn for the whole month.\n\n\"Alright you friggin' morons, listen up!\" Mr Delewski shouts, blowing hard into the silver whistle around his neck. Everyone stops their bickering and pays attention, although I get the impression some are just debating if they could take him in a fight.\n\n\"Now I know you're all a bunch of friggin' stupid, pumped up horn-dogs today!\" Delewski shouts, several of the students snarling and beating their tails against the ground in response. What the fuck is this guy doing, does he want to get killed?\n\n\"So, in order for you all to 'work through your energy' and 'find new outlets for your aggression' we's doing something different today!\" Delewski continues, forming finger quotes in the air. He reaches into a nearby bin, pulling out an iconic red rubber ball and pitching it to the nearest student.\n\n\"Dodgeball!\" He announces with a maniacal grin, a lead weight dropping into my stomach. \"Now form your friggin' teams!\"\n\n\n\n\nThe last bell rings for the day as everyone pours out the front doors and into the sun. It seems most of everyone's aggression has finally been burned away, some of the usual cliques chatting away normally. A few students are still literally butting heads, but it could almost be mistaken for the end of a typical school day. I trudge out with the last stragglers, aching all over from the innumerable bruises I'm soon to develop. Nobody even followed the rules in that insane bout, they just kept throwing balls at each other for the whole hour. Dropping heavily to the concrete steps, I take a seat and bask in the hot afternoon sun. It's over, finally over. At least for today anyway. I don't know how I'm going to survive a whole week of this. Consequences be damned, I think I'm just going to stay home for the next few days and wait for this all to blow over.\n\nI hear footsteps behind me, and I nearly jump up as a large shadow looms over me. I calm down as I see it's just Principal Spears, smiling down at me. He takes a seat beside me on the steps,  his shoulders slumping as an uncharacteristic wave of exhaustion rolls over him. His suit is nearly in tatters, he's got scratches everywhere, and even one of the lens is missing form his glasses. Despite everything, he seems to be in a good mood.\n\n\"So, Anon.\" He rumbles, his voice surprisingly deep every time I hear it. \"How was your first day of estrus week?\"\n\n\"Horrible.\" I moan, unwilling to put up a tough fa\u00e7ade. Spear chuckles, the sound like a friendly grizzly bear.\n\n\"Yes, it can be difficult. I'm impressed you managed to get through the entire day.\" He slaps me on the back, making me wince and nearly sending me sprawling down the steps, \"I'm afraid I must apologize, I meant to speak to you last week. As a human student, you aren't required to stay in attendance during estrus week. You may stay home if you wish.\"\n\n\"Wait, really??\" I ask, shocked and more than a little outraged. I went through all that for nothing? It was all pointless? I could have bailed at any time?\n\n\"Of course!\" Spears smiles, his teeth unnaturally large, \"I wouldn't subject a human student to that kind of danger. Don't be ridiculous!\"\n\n\"Then why even have school open at all?\" I ask, desperate for answers, \"This place is a madhouse! Nobody is learning everything, they just fight!\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, that's rather the point.\" Spears explains, conspiratorially tapping his nose, \"We keep them all here to burn off their aggression on each other. Could you image if we let them lose through the whole town? At least this way they're somewhat supervised.\"\n\nI open my mouth to argue, but I have to admit it makes a certain amount of sense. Having a bunch of hormone crazed dinosaurs running loose would probably be a small scale disaster. Before I can ask another question, there's a loud buzzing from inside Spear's pocket. He pulls out an old flip phone, comically small in his oversized hands, and flips it open.\n\nSomething on the other end roars loudly enough to make me jump, the speakers popping and crackling in protest. That thing isn't even on speakerphone, and it could probably be heard clear across a room. Spears seems unperturbed, simply nodding along as the roars continue unabated.\n\n\"Yes dear, I'm fine.\" Spears replies once there's an opening. There's another set of roars, just as loud as the ones before it.\n\n\"Yes dear, I know.\"\n\nAnother roar, this one only slightly quieter, but still probably deafening in person\n\n\"Yes dear, I'm on my way now.\"\n\nSpears flips the phone closed, putting it back in his pocket. He stands up straight, straightening the thin scrap of fabric that used to be his tie. I stand up with him, my abused back aching in protest.\n\n\"Well Anon, I'll see you next week.\" Spears bids me farewell, stepping down the steps. He stops on the sidewalk, looking back up at me with a sly smirk.\n\n \"Just remember, there's usually an upside to everything.\" He winks.","Title":"Estrus Week","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Spears, Reed and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Hope in The Grim Dark.txt":{"path":["Anon","Hope in The Grim Dark.txt"],"text":"Title: Hope in The Grim Dark\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: Short \nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n>It's been two and a half years since Anon joined the military\n>the media has been all up in a buzz over an approaching meteor, playing up fears of it smashing into Earth\n>experts made it clear that an actual impact was miniscule\n>they were right\n>instead, against all odds and known-to-anon physics, a piece split off instead and crashed into the North Pole.\n>It's been half a year now.

Recently, I've been acting incredibly self-destructive by allowing myself to read depressing writefaggotry on dinochan. If I was a normal person, I would have just shut down my computer and not spend my time on an Albanian weapons training forum. But of course, being the abnormally autistic individual I am, I do the exact opposite of that. My eyes are totally puffy and dry by this point. After reading a piece that was inspired by the author's own relationship problems with his pterodactyl family, I couldn't help but break down from there. It was so painful, but I couldn't stop reading it. It was like the more I tried to pull away the closer I was dragged to it by a thick rope. Throughout my time at Volcano High, I've really come to appreciate the different forms of art across the board. The three that hit most for me personally were music, drawing, and writing. Now, writing... has hit hard for me as you can see. I was never too much of a literature guy, not until recently, but I learned that it has a special charm that can't be rivaled.\n\nWriting is truly infinite, held back by no boundaries. You can create a world, and change it with the snap of a finger. The reader's mind then creates it's own idea of how your world is. A story is a wonderful, anonymous bond between the reader and the author, one that is mysterious, yet fully cherishable. Whether it is true, fictional, or inspired, it allows for the use of imagination; Our most cherished ability. Writers use their hopes, dreams, fears, experiences, and emotion to build the incredible worlds they have constructed with their hands. Readers use their lack of understanding of the world they're delving in to make their own idea of that world, thus creating a bond that cannot be achieved anywhere else. These worlds truly stick around, capable of bringing many things out of you. They make us laugh, make us smile, make us calm, make us hopeful, make us...\n\nCry.\n\nAnd, as far as I know, nothing else is like this.\n\nI continue to stare at the void of space, the stagnant cold air ever so slowly gliding off of me. With the perspective-changing pieces of literature written by the utmost remarkable stuck in my head, I can no longer move. The true power of writing has left me frozen. I don't think there's anything here that could get me out of this new depression.\n\nI break out of my endless trance as my phone lights up from the desk.\n\n[Fang] hey dweeb parents just left\n[Fang] come ovr and play guitar w me\n[Fang] i made dino nuggies for us\n\nWell... that might no longer be true.","Title":"Jumping Out The Rut","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Lowkeyloki"},"Past Redemption.txt":{"path":["Anon","Past Redemption.txt"],"text":"Title: Past Redemption\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Ripley, Samantha and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Cobalt_Blue_Sphere\nSummary: Too much happened too fast. Too many mistakes were made. The one at the center of it all decides to visit her one last time.\n\n\nI didn\u2019t know how long it had been since that black day. I\u2019d been holing myself up in my apartment. Nobody wanted to talk to me, and I couldn\u2019t blame them.\n\nEverything was too far gone now, and it was all my fault. The web of misery I\u2019d wrought stretched far. A half dozen families personally affected. A few dozen direct relations. A hundred-odd friends and acquaintances. All the students at a school that was now on the map for what could only be called a national disaster. I was pretty sure my own family were unaffected by what had happened, though. They hadn\u2019t cared to call while I was in hospital, at least. So it hadn\u2019t impacted them, for whatever that was worth. There was that.\n\nIn my introspection of late, I\u2019d realized things could never be the same again after this. Nothing could. There was no more help for it. No more hope for things to change. The line could never be uncrossed. In Fang\u2019s wake, my life had become a quiet, reflective nightmare where nothing happened.\n\nI remember I\u2019d used to dream of nothing happening to me. Of hiding away from the world. What I wouldn\u2019t give to be able to go back to those times before I ever met Fang, before I ruined everything. Was that a selfish thought? I supposed so. Didn\u2019t really matter anymore. Either way, it was weird that the time I\u2019d spent at Rock Bottom now seemed preferable.\n\nI was beyond saving, I knew that for a fact. That was half of the reason why I\u2019d finally come out of my hideaway to visit Fang in her... resting place. The solace of the dead who couldn\u2019t judge me anymore was preferable to the accusations of the living. The words I knew they\u2019d say if they ever saw me. The questions I didn\u2019t have any appropriate answers for. How on earth could I answer what they\u2019d ask of me? I had nothing. I was nothing, compared to the enormity of what had happened. It was all beyond me now.\n\nThe other half was that I knew I couldn\u2019t hide forever. The world called me, asking me to forget, to move on, to do better next time. I didn\u2019t want to \u2013 I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t just leave Fang behind like that. She was worth remembering. Worth holding onto, even... even now. I didn\u2019t judge her for what she\u2019d done.\n\nThe quiet earth that held her coffin didn\u2019t judge me, either.\n\nThat was why I\u2019d come here with the tools I had. She would understand. Naser was right next to her... hell, he\u2019d get it too. He\u2019d been a bro.\n\n\u201cSorry, Naser. I let you down,\u201d I whispered helplessly as I looked at his headstone. \u201cI let you down and you paid for it. I don\u2019t even really know what I did wrong, but I know... I know it was too much. Sorry doesn\u2019t cut it, I know, but... I just don\u2019t have anything else.\u201d\n\nNobody answered. Of course.\n\nI turned to Fang\u2019s grave next. It, too regarded me silently.\n\n\u2018Here lies Lucy. Heaven restores you in light.\u2019\n\nLucy. Her real name. She\u2019d been Lucy before, hadn\u2019t she? I\u2019d only ever known her as Fang. Were they the same person?\n\nI didn\u2019t know what Lucy was like. I knew what Fang was like. She was... beautiful. Precious. Willing to connect, even with someone like me who only fucked up his connections. It had been her undoing, as she\u2019d opened up and promptly been eviscerated from the inside by the poison I hadn\u2019t even realized I\u2019d been feeding her. I\u2019d been like a caustic drip feed to her, ruining her life through nothing but meagre proximity. I\u2019d gotten too close to a living being, and she\u2019d paid the price.\n\nShe\u2019d been... soft. Too soft. Receptive. Vulnerable. Too easily turned against her own self, without even realizing \u2013\n\nI shook my head as I became aware of the wicked thoughts creeping across my treasonous brain. That... was no way to think of her. She didn\u2019t deserve that. Especially not when it was my fault.\n\nI was trying to think of something to say to her when a sound snapped me out of my reverie. Footsteps.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d Fang\u2019s dad. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. The living had found me, just as I\u2019d known they would before the end.\n\nDully I looked up to see both of her parents standing there, a dozen feet away. The titan of a pterosaur was glaring at me hatefully, clearly only barely held in check by his dimunitive wife\u2019s iron grip on his arm. She, too, didn\u2019t look exactly happy to see me.\n\n\u201cRipley, dear...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou little piece of shit. You\u2019ve got some nerve standing there.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mumbled under my breath. Didn\u2019t care if he heard me. Didn\u2019t matter if he did or didn\u2019t, I supposed. Sorry wouldn\u2019t soothe either of them. Sorry wouldn\u2019t bring her back. Sorry didn\u2019t matter to her where she was.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sorry? You\u2019re fucking sorry?\u201d Ripley seethed. He did hear me, then. \u201cYou think that fixes anything, huh? That you\u2019re sorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cMy kids are both dead!\u201d The massive dino\u2019s roar echoed through the whole graveyard, Samantha cringed away, covering her ears, and birds in every direction took fright and flew away. \u201cI\u2019m not fucking stupid. You show up, and just like that they\u2019re gone \u2013 and you disappear. I know you had something to do with it! What the fuck did you do!?\u201d\n\nA few short weeks back, hearing him raise his voice like that would probably have put the fear of God into me something fierce. Today, everything was just numb, and I hardly felt it.\n\n\u201cI tried to help her.\u201d I murmured. No sense beating around the bush. That was exactly why they were dead. I looked down to the graves; my confession was as much for them as anyone else. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I tried to help her. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tried to \u2013\u201d Ripley snarled, furious incredulity colouring his voice red. \u201cWhat exactly did she need your help with so badly, huh? And how the fuck did your help turn her into \u2013 into this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d It was the truth. Everything I\u2019d said worked for me. How had it gone so wrong? Didn\u2019t matter anymore, I guess. \u201cShe hated them. Naomi. Naser. Everyone. I think it was my fault. I don\u2019t know. I thought I could help.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou... You fucking think... You...!\u201d I heard the boiling point reached in those words. Anger bubbling over.\n\nI heard the massive stomps of his approach. I heard his wife\u2019s panicked pleading.\n\nI think it was my body that reacted then to keep me safe. A second later, with the gun pointed at the massive ptero, I wondered why it was bothering. It worked, though \u2013 he stopped his approach mid-stride before settling back a bit and glaring balefully at me.\n\n\u201cYou going to kill me, too, then?\u201d He sneered.\n\nI supposed it would be pretty easy at this point. I had him dead to rights, really. But I didn\u2019t want to. I\u2019d caused her family enough pain in my short time here.\n\nAll too stupid to say aloud, so I didn\u2019t. I kept my silence, just held the gun pointed at him as a deterrent. He\u2019d come and take it away if I let him. I still needed this damn thing.\n\nSamantha drew up beside him, one arm steady on his as they both faced me down. She stood stoic alongside her husband, her eyes fixed on me, a painful mixture of emotions swirling within. Worry, grief, panic, determination. Defiant in the face of danger. It was almost like I was looking at Fang. Like a vision of her twenty years into the future. Like she wasn\u2019t dead in the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what I was doing now. I only knew I couldn\u2019t break. I had to hold my ground. I had to keep my face blank.\n\nWhy? Couldn\u2019t answer. But I knew it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a piece of shit.\u201d Ripley spat again. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough you break our family up once, is it? You had to come back for seconds.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnon, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Samantha asked me gently. Kind of sounded like Fang. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never wanted to,\u201d Cracks forming. Have to shut my mouth. Can\u2019t stop myself. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for any of this to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright,\u201d She said soothingly, trying to put a warm smile on to go with her bold lie. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to get any worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Too weak to keep myself quiet. At least it only came out as a whisper. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to get this bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright, dear,\u201d She lied again. \u201cJust put the gun down. You don\u2019t have to hurt anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your breath,\u201d Ripley growled. \u201cLook at this spineless shit. If he was going to shoot either of us, he would have done it already.\u201d\n\n\u201cRipley...\u201d She said warningly.\n\nHe continued on, unheeding. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault, you little shit. That little trike was right \u2013 if she hadn\u2019t met you, none of this would have happened.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. He was right. What could I say?\n\n\u201cYou were right there with her the whole time! You could have said something to actually help her! You didn\u2019t even say anything, did you?\u201d\n\nI had. Nothing good though, I don\u2019t think. I didn\u2019t want to think, anyway. I just wanted to let myself crumple then and there, but I managed to stop myself.\n\n\u201cYou fucked everything up! Whatever fucking poison you put in her head \u2013 you ruined everything! How the fuck have you got the nerve to stand there and point a gun at me!?\u201d\n\nIt was only by a miracle I managed to keep myself from falling apart under the condemnation. The pressure of my sins given voice from without was unbearable, echoing with the rightful guilty verdict I already had clanging around in my skull.\n\nIt had to stop. It had to give before I fell apart. He knew too much for me to take it. The weight of the truth was too much for me to bear.\n\nMercifully, it did. He stopped, giving up on me with a dismissive shake of his head.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, Samantha. Leave this worthless shit here. Lucy will understand if we come back later.\u201d He turned away, indifferent to the gun still being pointed at him. Slowly, nervously, Samantha did the same, and they walked away towards the graveyard gate.\n\nLater. They\u2019d come back later. The culmination of my failures would outlive me, a legacy of death that eclipsed my life. They\u2019d see it... later.\n\nSomething broke. A wall broke. I saw the truth behind it.\n\nIt was time I paid for what I\u2019d done. Time I did what I\u2019d come here for. No more stalling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d On a whim I called out to them. Maybe I could make it just a bit better before I left. One little act of penance, for all it was worth. \u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve this. None of you did!\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter what they had to say. It only mattered they heard. Maybe it would help a little bit.\n\nI looked down to Fang\u2019s grave.\n\n\u2018Heaven restores you in light\u2019.\n\nMaybe I\u2019d see her there.\n\nOr maybe I\u2019d be headed straight to hell.\n\nMaybe I\u2019d see her... there instead.\n\nI turned my gaze to the implement of my destruction. The bringer of repentance.\n\nSleek-barreled. Pretty in its own right, I supposed.\n\nRedemption at the pull of a trigger.\n\nI brought it up to my chin.\n\nSqueezed my eyes shut.\n\nSaw Fang\u2019s face in the dark behind my eyes. She looked kind of panicked. Couldn\u2019t really tell.\n\nWould have asked her what she wanted from me, if she was there.\n\nDidn\u2019t. Obviously. She wasn\u2019t.\n\nDrew in my last gasp.\n\nWilled myself to leave it all behind.\n\nLet out my last breath.\n\nSqueezed the\n\n\n\nThe gunshot rang out through the graveyard, a midnight bell tolling out its sorrow for another soul that never found its worth. A spatter of blood, bone, and brain flew with visceral report, and the empty body dropped heavily to the grass, the guilt gone with its mind. The weapon \u2013 the deceiver, the promiser of deliverance \u2013 fell out of its hands, its wicked work done.\n\nJustice had been an impossible dream for a long time. The path of redemption was long behind them all. But judgment still presided, sure and certain, even if those who sought her were not. The final bang of her gavel let her disappointment in her lost child be known.\n\nSamantha\u2019s horrified, primal shriek pierced the silence that followed.\n\n\u201cOh my God! Ripley, call 911!\u201d She shielded herself from the sight with her wings. \u201cQuick!\u201d\n\nRipley stood stock still, unable to respond, shock plastered onto his face. The kid had just died right in front of them. Shot himself right before their eyes.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t been lying. He had been sorry.\n\nHow many had died now in such a short time? How had it all gotten out of control? How had it come to this?\n\nIt was too late now. None of those who remained could know for sure exactly how long it had been too late for. The lost probably didn\u2019t know either, not that they could answer if they were asked.","Title":"Past Redemption","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Ripley, Samantha and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Cobalt_Blue_Sphere","Summary":"Too much happened too fast.

Only, you want to run away, pretend you are someone else or just fall asleep forever and never wake up. When you have someone who you\u2019ve come to know, love, and experience all the joys of your youth and young adulthood for years only for it to end in such a horrible manner. With the last words being \u2018I love you with all my heart,\u2019 and how much you have to lie to yourself that everything will be okay, but never will you ever realize what it was you wanted to do again.\n\nAnon felt like that for every waking moment since his grandmother\u2019s passing. He showed his own vulnerable side to Fang for the first time in a long time. He had no one to turn to but her. Now almost thirty years old and living with Fang, all he had left were the memories. He mentioned to Fang about how his family life\u2019s been rather rough, yet there was one good thing about it all and that was his grandmother. While Fang only knew her for a few short years, she was a darling to his Petro wife.\n\n He\u2019d go on about how such a wonderful sweet woman she was, and just how full of joy she was in life. The memories he carried with him were some of the best he had ever had when he was a child. Five years old, up till 4 AM, playing Super Cave Brothers, having to eat through 20 lives to beat that one world with the annoying flying turtle dino thing.\n\nThe fresh cooked meals she would serve during each holiday celebration. Hell it was the best time because not only did he not get to see his dad, but he got to experience grandma\u2019s cooking. Just having her around was his perfect escapism than the creative escapism he was able to maneuver in a digital game. All those boomer rock and long nights of video gaming were all because of those special moments he had as a kid with her. \n\nAnon very rarely wanted to go to her grave. Mostly because he didn\u2019t want to feel that pain. He always had to steel that pain he was dealing with to support others who had also been affected by it. Anon, who wouldn\u2019t give less of a shit about anyone else, always tethered over the edge of a breakdown because he had lost someone he hadn\u2019t come to appreciate the time he had spent with her until these last several months. \n\nHe stared at the sound panel, his fingers traced along the buttons, switches and nodules and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to work. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to enjoy anything. Not the games, not the work, nothing except to bury his face into Fang\u2019s shoulder. Today was like any other day. He just stared at it,  even knowing he was nearly putting his job at risk. Despite his boss giving him so much time off because of grief, there were one days too many.\n\n\u201cHey\u2026 Anon\u2026\u201d a familiar voice came across the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve been staring at that panel for an hour.\u201d\n\nIt was Fang. Or, Lucy, however much it mattered. He looked upon her, his other wonderful thing to ever happen in his life. Oh how he wished he had her confidence right now. He wanted to hear her voice to tell him to do something. Anything.\n\nTell me to man the fuck up like I always when shit got bad. Tell me who I am and what I should be doing. Or just tell me to suck it up even. I don\u2019t know.\n\nFang walked over and threw her arms around him. Already he could feel himself trembling and breaking down. He reached up and wrapped his arms back around her in turn. \n\n\u201cAnon\u2026 I think we need to visit her grave again. I think we should, and you should  get it off your chest what you wanted to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t Fang\u2026\u201d Anon choked through his tears. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore. None of it matters. She won\u2019t hear me anyways.\u201d\n\nFang brushed her snout along his face and it only made him feel even more shitty about himself.\n\n\u201cAnon you won\u2019t be able to help yourself or overcome it if you don\u2019t. I will be there for you if you need it. You know I always got your back. I had your back when she needed you and I got your back now.\u201d\n\nAnon pulled back and looked up at her with those tear stained eyes of his. With a sniffle, he wiped his collared sleeve across his face. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t know if I can say what it is I really want to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t. Just being there would help you just as enough because at least you won\u2019t let your guilt eat up at you.\u201d\n\nThey took a moment, sitting there, embraced in each other\u2019s arms. Eventually, Anon finally stood up, wiped his tears away and was led out by Fang to their car. The drive toward the graveyard was agonizingly long.Feeling as though he is reaching the very end of everything.\n\nAnd there she was. As they pulled up alongside the marble tombstone, the epitaph \u2018beloved grandmother\u2019 was etched on the stone. \n\nAnon and Fang stepped out of the car and walked on over toward the site. When they got there, Anon\u2019s body started to feel heavy, his legs weak, and everything was weighing him down. He got down on his knees, and stared at her tombstone.\n\nHe was not sure how long he had actually sat there but it couldn't have been more than 10 minutes. The wind howled in the distance as the dawn of autumn came to greet the inhabitants of Anon\u2019s old hometown, and the dead in preparation for Hollow\u2019s Eve. Oh if the dead could really come back one night every year there\u2019d be so much he\u2019d want to say to her as he was about to say now.\n\n\u201cOh Fang\u2026 I wished you and her would have spent more time together\u2026\u201d he spoke, shifting where he knelt. Then he addressed his grandmother. \u201cI miss you grandma. I miss you so much. You have no idea how lonely it is without you. I\u2019ve only had you for a few years since and I thought I was actually going to have you forever. But\u2026 things don\u2019t always work out the way we want them to.\u201d\n\nAnon took a deep breath and shuddered. \u201cI wish we had done more together in life.  I wish it was more than just me taking care of you. I wanted us to go to the casinos again. I want to show Fang how much of a master you were at those slots. Those triple diamonds\u2026 they were always your favorite to play, weren't they? You didn\u2019t play any other slot machine beyond that.\u201d\n\nFang knelt down next to Anon and grasped his hand with hers and held him tightly. She nuzzled for him to continue. \u201cIt's okay\u2026 go ahead.\u201d\n\nAnother deep breath, only his voice was lost to the tears. \u201cI always took the moment we\u2019ve had for granted and I hate myself for it. And I hate that we couldn\u2019t have enjoyed your final moments in peace. You were in so much pain grandma that it hurts just thinking about that final moment. Even when you said you \u2018loved me with all your heart\u2019 I knew it to be true\u2026 but I wanted you to live so that you can show it again. And now I\u2019ll never have those moments we\u2019ve had together ever again.\u201d\n\nNo more going to the casinos together, no more going out to eat in those fancy Italian restaurants. No more of grandma\u2019s cooking. No more taking care of her. The hardest part was actually acknowledging that she\u2019s truly gone and nothing was ever going to be the same ever again. He wanted her back. He wanted her back so badly that he would do anything to get her back.\n\nFor more than an hour they sat there at her grave. Anon cried until there were no more tears left to shed. He cried until his eyes burned, bloodshot, and tired. He looked to Fang one more time, who was trying her best to keep herself strong for him. But he didn\u2019t need her to. All he needed was just a hug from her, that was it.\n\n\u201cIt's going to be okay Anon\u2026\u201d he heard her say through her own tears. \u201cRemember, she\u2019s in a better place now. She isn\u2019t suffering anymore. You can\u2019t beat yourself up like this anymore. You know you loved her\u2026 she knew you loved her\u2026 and she loved you. She would not want to see you destroy yourself like this Anon. You\u2019ve got to live for her.\u201d\n\nThey pulled back for a moment. Anon stared at Fang, face swelled with tears and heat from crying. He let out a mournful cry before shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Fang. Y-you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry hun\u2026\u201d she said as she hugged him again, helping him stand up. \u201cWe will get through this together.\u201d \n\nHer hands reached down to grasp for his. His legs stopped shaking but he still felt heavy and weak. Fang guided him back to the car, and settled him in the passenger seat. \u201cI\u2019ll drive us home for today. That's okay with you?\u201d she asked him.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m fine with that,\u201d he replied. Then he turned to face out the window, staring at her grave once more. As the car revved up, Anon blew her a kiss, and bid her goodbye.","Title":"Saying Goodbye","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Sinners From The Past Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Anon","Sinners From The Past Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: Sinners From The Past\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Ripley, Samantha, Moe, Naser, Naomi, Rosa, Stella and Anon\nRating: Semi-NSFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: Lowkeyloki\nSummary: After Anon and his friends narrowly escape an attack from a gang thought to be a bygone part of his life, he\u2019s forced to come clean about his past.\n\n\nContains depictions of gore, frequent language, emotional trauma + bonding, and a shitty combination of shits, giggles and feels. Jarvis, turn off all Gosling inhibitors.\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe spring breeze coming from the alleyway on the right had only improved Anon's already good mood, as the double date he was just on had ended in the highest note possible. He and Fang had just nabbed a venue, and a great starting one at that. Not only was it at a popular Pizzeria, it was also at Fang's uncle Moe's Pizzeria. The guy looked so happy to see his niece with a new friend and asking to perform at his restaurant. However, thinking back on it, Anon had just felt something click in the deepest part of his brain. The almost wicked smile, the body language, the accent, the heavy concern of family, it had all just hit Anon like a V8 truck slamming into him. \"Moe\" wasn't just a happy face; He had to have been a part of some sort of crime organization. The conversation with him had felt all too familiar, and Anon was not about to let that part of his life come rushing back to him, especially with his friends around. He had already had so many people break ties with him out of fear of association, and he couldn't let that happen again. These three silly meteor dodgers had given him the first feeling of friendship he's had in a very long time.\n\nIt was getting late. Black darkness had already shrouded over the town. As the four had approached the NasCar, Anon had a sudden light-bulb appear above his head. He's already impressed Fang, but he could do even better. He could impress EVERYBODY. Years of living in high stakes had given Anon the driving skill of a Rally professional. If Skin Row could give anyone anything of value it was Psychological strength and survival skills. Having escaped many \"deals\" gone wrong, Anon had mastered the art of driving, and he was going to wow everyone in the Charger Hellcat. Though, he wasn't about to just get in the car and show off, as he really wanted to have Naser's permission first. The dude had acted like a true friend towards him since the start, and he felt a strong sense of honesty and dedication coming off from him ever since they met. He was always willing to listen to Anon, always willing to help, and was just... a good guy.\n\nHell, Anon was willing to call him a brother. Maybe even family.\n\n\"Yo, Naser, can I PLEASE try something?\"\n\nNaser glances towards Anon, uncomfortably awaiting his request. The human continues\n\n\"Can I take this thing for a spin and drive you all back? I'd love to try this sucker out!\"\n\nNaser gives a long sigh as he had saw this question coming from a mile away. His dad had just given him permanent PTSD with his threat, so there was no way in all of the nine circles of hell that he was going to let him drive.\n\n\"Absolutely not.\" \n\"But-\" \n\"Don't you remember when my dad brought me to the back room for a little \"talk\"? Yeah, there's no way that's happening. Sorry bro.\"\n\nNaser's response is quick and straight to the point, much less to Anon's disapproval. Quickly huffing at the rejection, Anon begins to walk toward the back left seat where he had been before, but notices a black luxury car with a pamphlet 4 spaces away from him. Jogging towards it, he starts to get a small, but dreadful feeling in his gut. It couldn't possibly be what it looks like, could it? Leaning down, he picks up the pamphlet to see a silhouette of a Margarita Glass with a pistol barrel sticking out of its right side. The feeling gets worse and his heartbeat begins to quickly accelerate. \n\n\"Uh...\"\n \nIn the distance, Anon can see four other humans coming out of a restaurant. They were all dressed in older-era dapper clothing, and one of them held a black and grey striped fedora to match the clothing of their suit. They had begun to stand around a pole, conversing with each other. Good, this was his one shot to warn the others before disaster struck. \n\n\"GUYS?\"\n\nThe three called out to quickly snap their heads towards the worried voice. \n\n\"COME HERE, QUICK!\"\n\nAnon's shout quickly brings them over behind him. He grabs the pamphlet, flips it open and holds it near his chest. \n\n\"We can't stay here long. Naser, I gotta drive us home, it's absolutely necessary, understand?\" Naser rolls his eyes at the panicked Anon, not understanding his sudden fear. \n\"Dude, we literally just went over this like 30 seconds ago. You are not driving my c-\" \n\nAnon cuts him off with a finger to his mouth, turning over to the back of the car. He quickly checks the back of the vehicle to confirm his suspicions.\n\nThe Mercedes logo seems to ominously stare into Anon's soul as he realizes who's here.\n\n\"I mean it, I know who these guys are we gotta go!\"\n\nFang starts to also get the feeling of dread bouncing in her stomach. \n\n\"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\n\"These guys are not good news, Fang, they're part of a mafia called Shots, and they absolutely do NOT like me at all, so we need to-\"\n\nA new voice twirls Anon's attention to the group by the pole one more.\n\n\"There he is!\"\n\nAnon goes into full panic mode as he's recognized and starts to run towards the NasCar driver's seat. \n\n\"GO, GO, GO, GO! HURRY, GET IN THE CAR!\" \n\nAs if on instinct, everyone begins to run after Anon into their seats, with the exception of Naser. \n\n\"I'M DRIVING!\" \n\"Bu-\" \n\"GET! IN THE FUCKING! CAR! RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNaser starts to take in the circumstances and jumps into the front passenger seat, never before seeing his friend like this. Anon quickly starts up the car, shifts the gear to reverse, and double checks to make sure everyone's in. With a look to his left, he sees the four human gangsters are already in their car, with one holding a pistol and aiming it at him. \n\n\"SHIT!\"\n\nAnon slams the gas pedal just in time as the bullet bounces off the front edge of the driver's window, to which everyone yelps at. He gets into the street and skillfully spins the car into the main road. The chase had just begun.\n\nThe car very quickly accelerates down the main road as everyone begins to panic even more.\n\n\"GO, ANON! GO, GO!\"\n\"I'M TRYING, DAMNIT!\"\n\nAs Anon hopelessly tries to reassure Fang, Naomi and Naser join in with a spaghetti-spilling train of their own.\n \n\"BABE, WHAT'S HAPPENING?\" \n\"I DON'T KNOW!\"\n\nAnon regretfully takes a glance to his right as the gang had already caught up to them. He sees the man holding the pistol again, noticing an intention to shoot both Naser and him. \n\n\"Naser, DUCK!\" \n\nThe two of them do so right on time as a stream of bullets glaze by them in less then a second, with all but a scratch on Anon's forearm. He slams the brakes to get behind the Mercedes and hopefully avoid more gunfire. In fact, he needs to start returning some medicine of his own. Fishing into his jacket, Anon nabs his Ruger Mark IV from his inner pocket, much to Fang's surprise.\n\n\"What the FUCK?!\" \n\"COVER YOUR EARS!\"\n\nIgnoring the shout, Anon thwips out the pistol at the two gangsters in the back. BLAM. One bullet finds its way square in the chest of the man on the right... hello Tinnitus, my old friend. Anon doesn't have time to celebrate however, as the left pawn brings out an assault rifle and steadies their aim. \n\n\"FUCK!\"\n\nAnon is forced to slam the gas once more, flying by the other car as bullets ricochet off of the doors and roof in rapid succession.\n\nThings had started to become REALLY stressful. The screams of bystanders, the blinding lights, Naomi's crying, Naser's hyperventilation, and Fang's incoherent shouts to Anon all start to take their toll. He needed to concentrate more right now then he will probably ever have to, or else it would be the last time he tried.\n\n\"EVERYONE SHUT THE FUCK UP! I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE, LET ME DO THAT SO WE CAN LIVE!\"\n\nThat immediately turns the passengers silent. Anon spots a new intersection after about two miles of sheer terror. It's now or never. \n\n\"Everyone hang on!\"\n\nHe swerves over to the farthest lane on the right before taking a hard drift left to the next street. Everyone almost falls on each other before Anon straightens out the car, snapping everyone back into place. They don't get a chance to recuperate before he accelerates full force once more. Ahead, there was an absence of street lights. This was PERFECT! Still speeding up, Anon gets to the last burning light and turns off the interior, front and tail lights. The pitch black nothingness of the night invades everyone's sight as the car heads to the right and starts to skid on the dirt. Anon narrowly avoids another crash with twists and turns, bringing the car to a full stop far past the side of the road.\n\nHe notions for everyone to stay where they are. At this point, no one was going to question his methods; Those ended up saving their asses. Anon struts to a nearby collection of bushes, gun in hand. The remaining three humans had to have still been chasing them. And speak of the devil, they are. Speeding at nearly 150 miles an hour, the intimidating Mercedes flies down the road, lights still on, with no clear end in the driver's sight. If this was going to work, it had to be perfect. No fucking this up now. Turning his flashlight to \"Strobe\" and \"23000 Lumen\" Anon holds the gun close to his side, patiently waiting for the car to get close enough to distract the remaining gangsters inside.\n\nHere it comes.\n\nNot yet...\nWait...\nWait...\nJust a little longer...\nAND-\nNOW!\n\nAnon jumps out of the bushes and turns on the strobe harsh enough to blind anyone. As the car is about to pass, he uses the opportunity to shoot at the back tire. Flying by, the Mercedes starts to swerve sideways, then it finally flips. In the distance, glass, doors, gears, and other machinery can be seen flying off the already totaled vehicle. It starts to flip more, and more, and MORE, speeding up every time contact is made with the asphalt. It finally stops at a metal pole, nearly piercing the car in half.\n\nAnon stares at the scene before him, giving him the most relief that any living being could have ever been given. It unfortunately came with more ear-shredding Tinnitus plus a Migraine, but he could barely notice them at this point. What mattered is that the others were safe and that the threat is done for. He might be all by himself again, but that didn't matter right now. Everyone was going home safe and sound tonight.\n\nAnon quickly gets to the car and steps in without a word. He needs to get everyone to the hospital and inform the authorities of their scuffle. Turning on the lights once more, the badly beaten NasCar speeds down the road towards the bustling city streets.\n","Title":"Sinners From The Past","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Ripley, Samantha, Moe, Naser, Naomi, Rosa, Stella and Anon","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Lowkeyloki","Summary":"After Anon and his friends narrowly escape an attack from a gang thought to be a bygone part of his life, he\u2019s forced to come clean about his past."},"Sinners From The Past Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Anon","Sinners From The Past Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Chapter 2\n\nBreaking several traffic laws, Anon continues to hurriedly drive himself and the other terrified three to the nearest hospital, not too far away now. The silence does little to help the seemingly infinite Tinnitus stuck in everyone's ears. No one could even begin to know how to feel. The chase of their lives had just ended not even 5 minutes ago, and death kept his presence heavy amongst the four. Anon had begun to shake from the leftover adrenaline, nearly hindering his driving. It didn't help that what was thought to be a scratch on Anon's forearm from earlier had ended up to be a gnarly gash , leaking blood on his clothes and unfortunately the driver's seat as well. The pain was beginning to set in, and it felt like a flamethrower had his arm torched at point blank range. A sharp intake of air does little to numb the pain. Fang is about to say something to Anon, but the thought quickly leaves her head as soon as it comes. She still had to let him concentrate, lest he crashes the car after escaping what would have been certain death if it weren't for his bravery earlier.\n\nThe hospital finally starts to come into view. Come on now, it only gets easier from here. Looking right and back, Anon can see small cuts and bruises on everyone else from the shattered glass and the janky ride. It was like they had all just gotten off a ride of Dino-horn Bobsleds. However, it's the least of Anon's worries, as keeping them alive and safe is what actually mattered. Pulling up to a free parking spot surprisingly close to the entrance, Anon and others let out a collective sigh as relief finally washes over. The beaten up NasCar finally begins to rest from its damage given to it earlier. After taking everything in for about a minute, everyone begins to get out of the car, one by one. Anon begins to lean against the door of the car, but doesn't get a chance to recuperate as a furious looking Naser is already speedwalking towards him.\nWhat the hell is he doing?\n\n\"Hey-\"\n\nPOW.\n\nStars. That's all that Anon can see as Naser's sudden sucker punch in the face makes Anon land right on his ass. Callouts to Naser are left ignored as he's already grasping Anon by the collar with one hand, clenched fist in the other. A booming voice scarily similar to his father's comes out of him.\n\n\"YOU! You've got some fucking explaining to do! What the FUCK was that?! Why did we just happen to be in danger when we were all together?!\" Naser raises his fist higher. \"Maybe I can beat the answers out of you!\" However before his fist can make contact once again, Anon's gashed arm suddenly stops the fist from getting another punch. The fist the other arm to everyone's surprise collides into Naser's face with just as much force, immediately unclenches, then heads right to his throat, holding him hostage in a choke hold. Now fully standing up, Anon uses both hands to choke Naser while he fails to do so himself. Yes, it's in the position you're thinking of.\n\nFang and Naomi rush in to break up the fight, worrying it was about to turn deadly.\n\n\"NO, ANON, STOP!\"\n\"NASER!\"\n\nThe two rush in and force the others apart, Anon tries to rush back in, but Fang suddenly yanks him back. It takes both of the girls' strength to keep Anon away, who's currently in a fit of rage from Naser's previous actions.\n\n\"UNGRATEFUL SON OF A BITCH! I JUST SAVED YOUR GOD DAMN ASS! YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO PUNCH ME AFTER THAT?! I'VE KILLED BASTARDS FOR DOING A TENTH OF THE SHIT YOU JUST PULLED! FUCK YOU! I-\" Anon gets the instant realization of what he just said, and the feeling of his shoe being shoved down his own throat returns. All the rage that was just there 5 seconds ago had all vanished like a handful of sand in the wind. Anon stops trying to break free and keeps his eyes locked on Naser. Cold. That's all Anon felt as he froze in place. Then the shaking began. No more words could have formed out of his mouth if he tried.\n\n\"...Anon?\" \n\nFang's concern did nothing to help the situation. Shaking heavier than before, Anon instead stares at the asphalt below him, clenching his teeth as the waves of emotion continue crashing down. This is it, they were going to leave him behind. He's once again going to be back to square fucking one. Just when he thought that he had the ones to call family as well. The blood still seeping it's way out of Anon's nostrils starts to burn, forcing him to stain his shirt with a wipe using his good arm. Maybe there's a way to save this relationship, first time for everything as they say.\n\n\"Um, Anon, I think Naser's right. We really need to know why that happened. What's going on?\"\n\nA shook Naomi interjects. One glance tells Anon she is frozen in fear from his words. Further observing the world around him, he sees the siblings have similar expressions on their faces. Anon desperately tries to get something out of his mouth, anything- but no noise comes as all words repeatedly die in his throat. What was he supposed to say? Anything he'll tell them will drive them off, and it'll just be darkness all over again. The drug deals, the forced murders, the underground hierarchy, the stored wealth... any one of those are going to make them run. Standing in the same place for the past minute or so had left a pool of blood from Anon's wounded arm, and everyone is STILL frozen. Someone do something, damn it! He'd rather pass out from blood loss having said something than nothing at all!\n\n\"Please, tell us. You know you can tell us anything, right?\"\n\nBullshit. Anon was certain the moment he revealed a speck of his past, it won't matter anymore. Naomi gets the case of the waterworks once more as her shaky voice shows more desperation as she speaks.\n\n\"Anon, please, please, PLEASE! I'm begging you, please! Don't leave us in the dark! We need to know what's wrong with you, we want to help you, PLEASE!\"\n\nNaomi is facing head down, gripping both sides of Anon's jacket, sobbing a tsunami out of her eyes. though, to Anon, it hadn't felt real for a second. She only pretended to care about him just to get closer to Naser. There was no way that he was going to tell her jack, not after her showing that she's a manipulative bitch. She had the gall to stab strings into Fang and his hearts for her shitty, selfish reasons and expects him to do her bidding again? Not on your life, \"friend\". Anon immediately shoves Naomi away.\n\n\"NO!\"\n\n\"No, God, please...\" Anon's voice raises as tears fall once more, projecting to everyone now.\n\n\"I can't, I fucking can't! Because the second I tell you anything about my past, you'll just run off! Yeah, you! All of you! You don't even have to lie to me about it, I know it's inevitable! Every FUCKING time! When I'm done, you'll fly your asses to China just to be as far away from me as possible! Please, you all are the only family I've had in the longest time! I love you all more than you could imagine! I haven't felt happiness in a decade and you're forcing me to just abandon that when I finally get it again?! You're telling me that you're not going to get in that car... drive off...\" Anon's voice simmers as it turns from angry-depression to pure hopelessness. \"...and leave me behind and... go where... I can't find you?\"\n\nNaser slowly stands up, staring at what seems to be right at the gateway to Anon's soul. Thump.... thump, thump. Naser starts to walk almost gravely toward Anon... No, wait, it's a speed-walk again?\n\nOh shit, is he doing a full-on sprint?!\n\nWHAT-\n\nNaser slams into Anon, wrapping his arms around him in a bear hug, constantly re-adjusting himself as if he would slip into a black hole if he wasn't giving the hardest embrace he could. The momentum eventually slows down, finally bringing them into a full stop. Anon goes from feeling absolute shock, then love, then fucking clueless, then back to love, all in the space of an attosecond. He couldn't believe what was happening to him, but it felt real. For the first time in a while, he's self-assured with the thought that he's finally cared for again. Waterworks were crashing through the dam again, but that was the least of Anon's concerns. He's needed this hug for all of his life, and he finally got it. Naser finally speaks to glue in the assurance. Even he can't hold back silent sobs of his own.\n\n\"No... We're never going to do that... never. We're staying with you, no matter what. We're not leaving family behind...\"\n\n\"At least I won't... I'm with you. You'd better fucking believe it.\"\n\nAnon slowly raises his arms.\n\n\"GOD...\" \"DAMN IT!\"\n\nAnon returns the gesture, wrapping his arms around Naser just as hard as he was. Naser could have never expected that Anon was keeping this inside of him for all of these years. It's funny, he thought that he had been through a lot of shit. Anon proved to him in that moment that there's always someone out there who's suffered more than you. In this case, the gap felt almost infinite. Naser knew exactly what he was feeling, but it had to have been multiplied ten fold. When he jumped off of a roof and broke his wing, he hadn't told a soul outside of his immediate family how it happened. It nearly split his spirit to the bone.\n\nNaser wondered how Anon hadn't ended his own life yet. Going through what he had and living on must take an impossible amount of resolve. He's probably the strongest person he's ever met, and there probably won't be another that comes even close.\n\nWalking up to Anon, Fang finally breaks her silence, beginning to take everything in.\n\n\"Anon... you don't have to say anything to us. You don't owe us anything. If it hurts to think about, then don't worry about it.\" Oh, it hurts to think about a LOT. He couldn't walk off without letting them know about who he truly was. They needed some slack cut for them, as they were literally inches away from death due to his presence at a bad time. Slowly letting Naser go, the two are freed from the oxygen-denying hug as Anon responds.\n\n\"No Fang, I... you guys deserve to know. I've already caused way too much trouble as it is, but all of you need to promise me something first...\"\n\nAnon stretches out his right hand to everyone, giving each and every single one of them a glare that could go down to the deepest, darkest parts of themselves.\n\n\"I want you all to promise me that you'll stay by me... I need you to shake on it.\"\n\nNaomi walks up first. A firm grasp with a hand over the other, along with a push down and a truthful nod seals the deal.\n\nNaser is next. He keeps one hand at Anon's back and gives his promise with the other.\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\nFang finally steps up, giving a reassuring smile while starting to cry herself. She shakes with the same gesture Naomi does.\n\n\"Of course... but we need you two patched up first. You both look horrible, especially you. You're still bleeding from that bullet glaze, Anon.\"\n\nOh shit, she's right. Better get that fixed before it turns real bad.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 3 Days Later ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTaken into the ER, Anon was given a surgery to patch up his gash, and everyone else was treated for minor injuries. It had unfortunately taken a few days before visitors were allowed in Anon's room. He had ended up with a large wrap around his left arm, underneath it was a good chunk of stitches patching up the wound. Currently staring at the ceiling in the late night, Anon had started to ruminate on the three's promise. He felt their honesty coming off from them as they shook his hand, yet he couldn't stomach the feeling that it was a lie either. It always had to be that voice from the darkest part of his mind telling him that nobody was going to be there for him. But from now on, he wasn't going to let it control his life. He's finally on a new path, and nothing was going to stop him from continuing down that path.\n\nA pterodactyl doctor comes in to check in on Anon, again attempting to give him normal company. Unfortunately, neither Anon nor his friends were safe from the paparazzi. The chase made national news, and every news station was digging for all the information. It took lots of intimidation to keep them away. It was even a challenge keeping them from bursting into Anon's room to harass him. During his time here, Anon and Doctor Crecellius have had a wonderful time talking to each other, finding comfort in the tense situation around them. Unimaginable stress from the press seems to have brought the two together in a harmony of their own.\n\n\"'Ello again.\"\n\"Hey, Doc.\"\n\"You gotta few... ah won't even beat around the bush here. You've got yerself a crowd of visitors waitin' out there for ya, no more than 10 ah'd say. Ah dunno who you want in or out. Nun'a them look like those paparazzi folks though.\"\n\nOh, what the hell, let 'em in. Although the Doctor was great, he needed more than one person. He absolutely needed to see the other three after the scuffle, hoping they weren't mentally dead from the pressure.\n\n\"I'll take all of them, Doc. They've got lots to catch up on. You can be at ease now, I'll take it from here.\"\n\"You sure, Anon? It's a lot of folks to take in at once.\"\n\nA nod confirms Anon's request.\n\n\"I'm sure.\"\n\"Well, alrighty then. Ah'll come back to check on you tomorrow, See you then, friend.\"\n\nOpening the door to Anon's room, the Doctor gestures a welcome before he takes leave. And dear lord, he wasn't kidding! It practically was a crowd, everyone's here! Fang, Naser, Naomi, Reed, Trish, Rosa, Stella-\nFANG'S PARENTS AND UNCLE MOE?!\n\nGoing into full panic mode from the sight, Anon throws himself out of the bed and holds himself against the corner of the room. That's it, he's dead. Done. Finished. Now here come the bullets to finish him off once and for all. At least that's what Anon thought before Moe spoke up to the terrified human.\n\n\"Woah woah woah, hey, kid! It's okay, we're not here to hurt ya!\"\n\nRipley also reassures Anon, noticing the complete fear on the poor guy's face.\n\n\"Anon, you're okay. We're not here to hurt you. You can settle down.\"\n\nHe slowly lets himself go from the wall, struggling to stand. Finally regaining his footing, he notices Samantha slowly approaching with an upset look on her face. Anon also slowly approaches, having the words die in his mouth just like before. They stop in front of each other. However, she starts to look angrier than before-\n\nSLAP.\n\nEveryone's eyes go as wide as dinner plates at the scene before them, jaws dropped to the floor. Anon's head is forced to the side, but the disappointed expression on his face doesn't change. He gladly accepted to smack to his face, knowing that it was coming for a while. \n\n\"MOM!\"\n\nFang yelps out at her mother's slap, feeling both protective over Anon and terrified at what was going to happen next. However, Anon immediately turns down the intensity with a collected response.\n\n\"Fang... it's fine.\"\n\"...I deserved that.\"\n\nAnon sits down on the bed, prepared to spill everything. Breathe in, breathe out.\n\n\"Well, I've got some stuff to clear up for you all. Get comfortable, you're gonna be here for a while.\""},"Sinners From The Past Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Anon","Sinners From The Past Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"Chapter 3\n\nIt was a while, a good chunk of hours to be more specific. Ripley was able to use his authority as a high-ranking police officer to give everyone permission to stay past visiting hours. During the time he had, Anon had told EVERYTHING. Every major event. The gang involvement, the driving skills, the constant abandonment from others, his parents' deaths, the life-threatening drug deals, even the story of how he bought the pistol he owns. After what could have been the biggest truth bomb ever told, everyone's in tears. Especially Reed after hearing the story of Anon's accidental overdose with extra fentanyl laced in. He sat right by Anon with understanding, as a similar episode happened to him. He knew the true dangers of stimulants, every druggie did, yet no one ever wanted to talk about it. If anyone tried, the thought would quickly be pushed aside. Hearing Anon's stories finally brought that pain in the back of his mind out of him. Reed couldn't bare to see anyone else having to go through the kind of pain he did, especially one of his friends, but at the very least he had one more thing in common with Anon. Fang had a very small suspicion that Anon had a similar history to Uncle Moe once upon a time, but his masking allowed that thought to escape right when it came. Fang never could have expected that her gut told her the truth. It usually doesn't, so this is a pleasant surprise for her. Trish has been itching to gore Anon with her horns ever since she heard he had basically gotten her friends had into a deadly chase, but after hearing Anon's story, the feeling has toned down. It isn't totally gone, she still thinks that it was partially Anon's fault that the four had almost lost their lives that day, but she isn't not going to give credit where it's due. As for everyone else, they're still in shock, struggling to take it all in.\n\nSitting by Anon on the hospital bed, Reed slithers his hand into Anon's in hopes of consoling him.\n\n\"Anon... how the hell are you alive right now, dude? It sounds like you should have died from that dose you took, man. D-don't get me wrong, I'm happy that you're here, but... how on Earth did you survive?\"\n\nHe saw this question coming from a mile away. Luckily, with the can on it's side, the beans can keep spilling without too much trouble.\n\n\"I remember shaking on the ground and not being able to move. I couldn't feel any pain, but I knew for a fact that I was in a horrible state. I was gagging from the air itself. I remember screaming \"I can't breathe, I can't breathe\" over and over in hopes that someone was going to hear me. It was like someone was forcing their knee on my throat. Someone burst through the door after I was already screaming for about 3 minutes, I couldn't tell who it was, I was only able to see their clothing. He looked like a million bucks. I can only remember him picking me up and throwing me in a limo to drive me to the hospital. After that, it's just fog. I kept fading in and out of consciousness. In, out, in, out, over and over again. When we got there I only saw complete darkness... and then I woke up in the bed. I tried asking who it was that brought me here, but they insisted that I didn't need to know.\"\n\nAnon finally lets out a hearty chuckle before continuing.\n\n\"Heh. Now that I remember, the way the guy was talked and all kind of reminded me of you, Uncle Moe.\"\n\nAll eyes are on Moe now. From him comes one deep breath in, and one deep breath out. He gestures towards 5 of the visitors, all noticeably not part of his family.\n\n\"Hey, dere's somethin' very important I need ta tell Anon ova here. You youngins mind scramin' for a bit while I talk to 'em? Also, while you're at it, get that thing from the lot out front, will ya?\"\n\nNot wanting any trouble with the intimidating Tyrannosaurus, Reed, Naomi, Trish, Rosa and Stella immediately take their leave and head to the parking lot to... get something?\n\nBefore he can think more on it, Anon notices a horrifying glare from Moe. Needless to say, it was one that was sure to have Anon nearly shit his pants at the sight.\n\n\"...Anon, if yous tells anyone what I'm about to tell ya, I'm turning you into tomorra night's stew, capiche?\"\n\nA loud gulp and nods at breakneck speed shows the human's understanding of his situation. \n\n\"Alright... Anon, dere's a couple a' things I need ta tell you, son. Remember what you was just talkin' about wit that drug incident?\"\n\"Yes, Uncle Moe.\"\n\"And how yous said that the one who saved you sounded like me?\"\n\nAnon starts to freeze up. There's no way it's what he thinks it is.\n\n\"...Yeah?\"\n\"Well, yous was right, Anon.\"\n\"I was the one who saved yous that day.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nFreezing cold, unforgiving, relentless silence.\n\nThe realization hits everybody like a freight train, and Anon nearly screams at the top of his lungs.\n\n\"WH-\"\n\nMoe quickly covers his mouth with a deadly stare before any noise comes out. The now speechless Anon nods in fear and shock, listening in.\n\n\"And the gang yous been in for almost your entire life?\"\n\"It's wonderful ta see yous again, Underboss Leo!\"\n\nThat right there...\n\nThat's the moment he knew.\n\nFrom the oddly happy attitude, to the sketchy money practices, to the formal title with his real name. It's all summed up now.\n\nMoe wasn't just any dodgy big-mustached Tyrannosaurus, he was the boss of a gang.\n\nThe very same gang that Anon had grown up in for all of his life just until about a year ago.\n\nEveryone begins to look at Anon with worry as he just... stares. It's the kind of stare that's so distant you can't tell if they're alive or not. He was lost, not even in his own thoughts, just completely lost. Time seems to have stopped for what felt like hours to Anon, and it didn't show any signs of resuming. His hand is held over his mouth, eyes wide open, staring at the floor. Fang begins to make her way toward Anon, each step a thundering boom to his ears.\n\n\"Anon?\"\n\nHe doesn't move. Not a single inch. It's almost as if he became a statue, or a hollow body with nothing inside. He couldn't believe that for most of his life he's been working under Uncle Moe himself. The boss' identity had slipped right under Anon's nose. Fang calls out once more in hopes of helping him.\n\n\"Anon...\"\n\nShe places both hands under his chin, responded to by a gasp through Anon's teeth.\n\n\"Look at me, Anon.\"\n\nHe hesitates for what feels like another eternity before slowly moving his eyes to Fang's.\n\n\"I know that... this is a lot, and... nothing makes sense right now.\"\n\"Anon, I...\"\n\nShe begins to struggle against a wave of tears, getting even closer to Anon.\n\n\"I'm so sorry...\"\n\nShe lightly wraps both arms around his neck, sobbing quietly to herself. She never wanted to admit it, but she felt responsible for bringing Anon into this entire mess. The family tie to Uncle Moe's criminal organization gave her the idea that anyone brought close to her emotionally would rope them in to their own world of trouble. She was never intimidated in order to feel this way, it just naturally came.\n\nAnon very slowly brings his arms up to Fang's back for his own embrace, still feeling as unstable and discombobulated as before. Thinking on it more, he began to feel responsible. Wherever he went, trouble seemed to always be only a few steps behind. It glued to him as if it was his own shadow in the sunlight. It was his fault they chased him. His reputation alone could have caused 3 innocent lives to be taken, and for what?\n\n\"Fang, you have to understand, I don't... you guys... this isn't...\"\n\nA short huff of annoyance comes from Anon as he continues to blurt out the any words that come to his mind.\n\n\"You all shouldn't... I'm not... it's just...\"\n\nAnon pulls his arms back and starts digging his nails into his scalp using both hands in frustration.\n\n\"I FUCKED UP.\"\n\"I FUCKED IT ALL UP BY JUST BEING HERE, FANG.\"\n\"No.\"\n\nA new voice forces Anon's head to face the new voice of Ripley. He begins to walk towards the hospital bed.\n\n\"Don't you DARE say that. I don't think you realize what you've done for us all.\"\n\nHe kneels down, straightening both arms and holding Anon by his shoulders and looking him right in the eye as if a father was consoling his son.\n\n\"You saved my kids lives, can you not see that?! You can't begin to imagine how glad I am to have you here, boy.\"\n\"Anonymous, you've shown something to me, and it initially wasn't something that I thought would ever be true.\"\n\"Look, I thought you were some nobody skinnie who couldn't do anything right to save his life.\"\n\nAny ego that Anon had left might as well have sunk to the center of the earth with that one.\n\n\"But, not only have you proven to me that you possibly have the most resolve out of anyone on this planet... you've also shown that you can protect people.\"\n\"You protected 3 innocent lives, Anon. You protected my family. There's nothing that makes me happier than seeing someone look out for my kids, especially as much as you.\"\n\nHe gestures to Fang and Naser in a quick panorama motion.\n\n\"When these two told us what happened, they said that you had a certain look while you were driving. They described it as \"the look of someone who was ready to die.\" Would you agree with them?\"\n\"Were you prepared to die for my family?\"\n\nAnon doesn't hesitate to take a deep breath and nod.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nOH SH-\n\nAnother harsh hug comes in, but Anon is held up and his back is practically breaking this time. Ripley laughs to himself as he \"pats\" Anon on the back, AKA nearly impaling him with his hand. He was glad to have another embrace, but Ripley unintentionally pushed it a bit with his brute strength.\n\n\"ACK- RIPLEY- BACK!\"\n\nNow knowing to stop, Ripley does so. He places Anon back on the hospital bed and gives him the look that simply states \"I'm proud of you\".\n\nAnon gives a happy chuckle, currently full of contempt and comfort. From that point on he knew that everything was going to be okay. However, he still was concerned for Moe. Wouldn't he be mad about ANY of this?\n\n\"Hey, Moe... I'm sorry about tonight. I know that telling me all of that was probably not what you were planning, and it must've been hard. Thank you.\"\n\"Of course, kiddo. If anyone should be apologizin', it's me. Yous been through a lot, the least I coulda done is tell ya... I'm sorry.\"\n\"Surprised yous didn't catch on, though! Why'd yous think I was so happy to see ya, especially wit my lil' Lucy?\"\n\nAnon now had the feeling that told him how to solve it all now. He was going to officially let go of his past instead of just shoving it to the side. How he would go about doing it was still being brainstormed and probably will be for a while. This wasn't about to happen without the others, though. He would've never gotten this far without them, doing something as hard as that would be impossible alone.\n\n\"Well, there was one more thing I wanted to ask you guys.\"\n\nEveryone waits for Anon to ask in anticipation, getting the gut feeling that this was important.\n\n\"Will you... help me put my gang life behind me?\"\n\"I see a chance to start over, and I don't want to waste it. I know it'll be really difficult and there's no way for me to do this without you.\"\n\"Please?\"\n\nMoe gives a warm smile and places one hand on Anon's right shoulder.\n\n\"Absolutely. Don't worry kiddo, we's all here wit ya to the end.\" \n\nA sudden knock on the door makes everyone jump. The silhouette of Doctor Crecellius projects past the door blinds. Anon looks to Moe for permission to let him in, and he gives a quick nod.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nQuietly opening the door as to not wake sleeping patients in the nearby rooms, he walks in with a biggest smile Anon's seen from him so far.\n\n\"'Ello again, Anon. Ah got good news for ya! Yer free to go!\"\n\"What? How? What about the costs of the surgery, or contacting the insurance company, or-\"\n\"It's all been covered, son. All paid for. Someone was really lookin' out for ya these past few days.\"\n\nMoe hides his face from the Doctor to give Anon a sparkling wink with his signature toothy smile.\n\n\"And... yer friends gotta sweet surprise out in the front lot for ya too. They say yer gonna love it.\"\n\nEveryone in the room seems to line up towards the door, clearing the way so Anon can go first. He steps out with Moe right behind him, followed by the rest. Anon's heart had started accelerating in anticipation. What on Earth could they have for him? \n\nNaser almost sprints to catch up to Anon, clearly pumped about seeing his reaction.\n\n\"Hey man, you're gonna love this. You can take it as everyone's token of gratitude. I... also wanted to say sorry for whackin' you in the face.\"\n\"Nah dude, you're all good. I think I needed some sense knocked into me anyway.\"\n\nThey both chuckle at the joke, beginning to pick up the pace towards the hospital entrance. Just what in the name of Raptor Jesus could be on the other side of that door? Finally arriving, the only thing that's standing between the present and Anon was the double door. One foot at the mat below, and the double door opens to reveal Naomi, Trish, Rosa, Stella, and... a stunning, shiny red Challenger Hellcat on the road.\n\nAnon was about to faint at the sight. There was no way that this was real. It couldn't be, it wasn't! Yet, Moe's projecting call would put an end to Anon's disbelief.\n\n\"Welcome to the family, Anon!\"\n\nTo say that it was extravagant would be a disrespectful understatement. The muscle car's paint seemed to glisten even without the piercing of the sun. The running engine replicated that of a tiger's growl, ready to pounce it's unsuspecting prey. The smell of the tires invaded his nostrils with gritty smoke and rubber. It had to have been from the Ark of the Covenant, it looked too incredible for any mortal's eyes. Anon's heart was overtaken with absolute joy in that moment, and no other emotion was present in that moment. This was much more than a token of gratitude, it was an incredible showing of love. It meant the world to him, and it made him think of what Moe said to him.\n\nNot only was he welcomed to Fang and Naser's family, the others had welcomed him as a brother of their own.\n\n\"You... come on, you didn't...\"\n\nAnon begins to tear up as he approaches the car. On the trunk's hood, he could see multiple names painted on in their own unique fonts. Each and every one that visited him had written their names. Anon walks over to the left side of the car, gliding his hand over the back hood as he does so, his sensitive fingerprints pick up the ticklish feeling of everyone's names. He reaches the front door and opens it to show the driver's seat. After taking a moment to appreciate the inner scenery he steps inside, not bothering to close the door to see a sparkling deep black leather steering wheel and a custom home screen for the user interface in the center...?\n\nIt was exactly that. A photo showing everyone huddled together giving the brightest smiles they possibly could illuminated the interior of the car. Even Ripley was smiling like a normal person!\n\n\"Sooo? What do you think?\"\n\nTrish walks up to the car, hands behind her back as she waits for Anon's response. God, what did he do to deserve these meteor dodgers?\n\nA jump right onto her with a quick hug that could give Ripley's a run for his money is his answer. Damn it all, here comes the waterfall again.\n\n\"I love you guys...\"\n\"Oh Anon, you maravilloso humano, We love you too!\"\n\nRosa continues to fill Anon with joy. Dear lord, this is way too much to handle! Before he can faint from the happiness overwhelming him, Naser comes up with an oddly smug grin on his face.\n\n\"So Anon, wanna take this for a test drive?\"\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA newly repaired NasCar and a roaring Challenger sit next to each other, engines revving, rubber burning. Adrenaline was pumping, eurobeat blasting.\n\n\"Alright, let's go over this one more time. We go around the city block and back, not too far, got it? Also, I almost forgot to mention that whoever loses is paying for the band's next venue!\"\n\nThe stakes are high, the cheering deafening!\n\n\"Yeah Anon, show him who's boss!\"\n\"Bruh, show me those skills man!\"\n\"Naser, show that skinnie who's boss!\"\n\"TEAR HIM A NEW ONE BABE, BEAT HIM SO BAD THAT HE HAS TO GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL ROOM AGAIN, YEAH!\"\n\nHoly shit, Naomi.\n\nHere it is, the moment we've been waiting for. Waiting for about 15 minutes, to be exact.\n\n\"Oh, Anon, one last thing!\"\n\nA cocky glance from Anon prompts Naser to continue.\n\n\"Fang said she'd think that you'd make a good brother-in-law for me!\"\n\nWAIT\nWHAT\nWHAT THE FUCK?!\n\nNaser uses Anon's shock to speed down the street with a head start. Oh HELL no! He's not getting away with that!\n\n\"OH NO YOU DON'T, PRICK!\"\n\nThe two cars speed by each other as they disappear into the blinding streets.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n>this will never happen to you"},"The Journey Of A Lifetime.txt":{"path":["Anon","The Journey Of A Lifetime.txt"],"text":"Title: The Journey Of A Lifetime\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Samantha and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\nSummary: There were complications during childbirth.

He even had that look of calm intelligence duelling explosive fury, albeit still nascent. And Lucy in her mother's dress, the night as a whole, was a bittersweet memory.\n>Grug didn't make you feel like you had to pull pages from Ripley's playbook to keep him in line. Polite, respectful, sharp, and so sweet on your daughter that you could see the love between them from a mile off even then.\n>That's why news of him proposing after they both graduated college didn't shock you in the slightest. Your daughter was ecstatic, and you had to hold back the lone tear of pride that she was doing so well for herself after overcoming that transitionary phase of young adulthood, flourishing just as Fang, sweet Fang, did.\n>That's why you were sitting in the car outside the wedding venue, getting everything out now so you wouldn't ruin your little girl's special day.\n>You had already gone over all those pictures of Fang even before Lucy was just a twinkle in your eye. You would have given Grug your old tuxedo but retailoring it wouldn't taken too much, so now those wine-stained sleeves were coated over in drying tears. \n>Tears of sorrow when you went over the part of the book where Fang dropped off and Lucy picked up. The only pictures you had of the funeral were in your head, and even those were almost too much to bear.\n>But even why you wept changed as you watched all of those birthday photos and life's firsts start to roll in. Her first steps, her first violin, bass, and guitar, the first time she stepped out of your hands and into school. All those pictures with grandma and grandpa. Raptor Jesus bless Ripley and Sam.\n> High school, prom, and then the pictures she had mailed you from college. And now that blank page that was going to be filled with wedding photos.\n>You wish she could be here to have seen all of that. To see this.\n>Later on the ceremony starts up and you walk her down the isle, keeping it all together for her when you see her in her mother's old dress, wearing that amulet of amber.\n>You're strong for her when you think it's time to step away, one last time, for her to be wed to her man.\n>And you almost falter when Naser, somehow looking barely aged, taps you on the shoulder and hands forward a guitar. \n>Her guitar\n>Lucy turns to you and gives a smile that tells you this was her idea.\n>\"Dad, before we start, could you play something for us? I know she would want you to.\"\n>You almost break down but smile through the freshly welling tears as you take it and place the strap over your neck.\n>There's no question on what to play.\n>It's her song. It's the one she guided your hands on and wrote out in her head, passing it on to you. It's what you would play whenever Lucy couldn't sleep as a child and needed something to her lull her to sleep, and what you would sit and play when it felt like you couldn't go on any further.\n>You can only shut your eyes and go through it all. The dam breaks and you swear for one last time you can feel her hands guiding yours again.\n>All of it comes tumbling down as you finish the song off, all that's left to do is fling your arms around your daughter a final time, tell her how much you love her, how much her mother would've loved her, and step away after she squeezes you tight and lets go.\n>A few hours later while she and Grug are entertaining guests you can't help but sit off to the side, trying to recompose yourself.\n>You're so wrapped up in thought that you hardly notice when your side of the bench practically raises and a meaty, claw-tipped hand settles on your shoulder.\n>You swear this is the only time Ripley has done this without meaning for it to hurt.\n>He's still a grizzled stone of a pteropatriarch, somehow keeping muscle and an imposing stature on into old age. But there are some worn-out features to match; a milky eye and a few missing teeth. There's a fatigue behind the one he can still see out of that took up lodging when Samantha died and never left.\n>Everything passes for a while before he speaks.\n>\"I wanted to tell you something before we both go off and probably drink ourselves blind. You did it, son. You're one of the biggest reasons why my granddaughter is getting the happiest day of her life. You succeeded as a man and, more importantly as, a father. You didn't break even when it felt like everything was falling apart, and you did what a father is supposed to do. You kept everything together even in the face of total despair, all for her. You're a man I'm proud to call my son, and you can golf with me anytime.\"\n>You can only inhale deeply and say thank you before you get one of the ptero's rare pats on the back along with a smile as he gets up.\n>He was right. Just like you're the reason why she's here, she's the reason why you're still here. All of it, all of it for her\n>For her\n\n>You sit down on the park bench, your back complaining louder than it has in years\n>Volcadera bluff was a beautiful place but you had grown to hate the damp coastal air in your old age\n>Lucy used to chuckle when you complained about your bones but these days she just looked worried\n>You feel a pang of guilt, you really shouldn't be a burden on her, she's busy enough\n>People walking by don't pay you any mind, just an old man in the park, where did all that time go?\n>You heave a wheezing sigh that rattles your chest\n>You really shouldn't be out here, too many medical problems to be away from the nurses long\n>You're old enough to make your own choices, damn it.\n>High pitched squeals catch your attention\n>A gaggle of children, human, and dino alike are chasing each other\n>You probably sat on this same bench and watched lucy play tag just like you are now\n>You just... Can't quite remember that far back\n>You remember her wedding, you remember the birth of your grandchildren, you remember Ripleys last words to you\n>You remember Fang\n>You lived a good life, didn't you? Certainly a long one.\n>Seems like the only people that visit parks are the very young and the very old\n>You content yourself to watching the children play, utterly unaware of the lives they're going to lead\n>It's funny that no matter how many old people warn us to cherish our time we never do until it's gone\n>You've done your fair share of it after all, even if you know your grandchildren won't take it to heart just yet\n>Your eyelids are heavy, did the walk here tire you out that bad?\n>You lean against your cane, maybe you can take a quick nap before you go home?\n>Just a few minutes\n>When you open your eyes again you feel so much lighter\n>Someone's sitting next to you\n>Pure white like an angel, with wings to match\n>She gives you a smile that you could never forget, a smile from a rooftop so long ago it may as well be another life\n>\"Hey dweeb, what kept you so long?\"\n\n-ENDING FIVE OF FOUR-\n-The journey of a lifetime-\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Pkg8jHM6guw","Title":"The Journey Of A Lifetime","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Samantha and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous","Summary":"There were complications during childbirth.

A soft, fragile little ptero woman with a stubbled head and worn skin, leaning against my chest. It had been years since we reunited, but she maintained her almost haggard look from when we first spoke after several years, only now she had put on some healthy pounds, back to a less emaciated form and filling out her clothes better. She smelled like cigarettes and cheap beer, and it was a smell that now brought out feelings of desire within me. She was so beautiful, bags under her eyes and track marks on her arm, proof of the horrid life she took on after our brutal breakup in highschool. I\u2019m not one to judge, my time in the service had me visiting the clinic more than a few times a month for a myriad of issues, most of which involved burning urination and side effects of alcoholism. To this day I find my liver still kicking me every now and then reminding me of when I would pound a case of beer every night when off duty or chugging a bottle of vanilla extract with the boat\u2019s cooks on my worst days.\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d She sheepishly asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about how glad I am that you saved me\u201d I replied earnestly.\n\n\u201cShut up, cheeseball.\u201d She chuckled while blushing. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who saved me\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess we saved each other\u201d I said as I held her tightly with my free arm.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter what we watched every night, all that mattered was that we were together and holding each other. Any crappy sitcom would do, any pukeworthy romcom, any lame action film. The best part of every night was coming home to our decrepit apartment and meeting each other over a microwave meal, bitching about our shitty day and snuggling together on our second-hand couch. Occasionally I\u2019ll feel the burning stare of my beloved and I\u2019ll look down and ask, \u201cWhat\u2019re you looking at?\u201d \n\n\u201cI just love staring at you\u201d she\u2019d say with no pause. \u201cI love watching you eat, I love watching you sleep, I love watching you make stupid faces while you play videogames\u201d.\n\nI loved hearing her say it. I loved staring at her while she ate too, I loved watching her sleep too, and I loved the beautiful face she made when focusing on her guitar playing.\n\nThe crappy sitcom we were binging came alive in an uncharacteristically uproarious episode, the jokes hitting one after the other. Fang would laugh hard at every other line, and I joined her in mirth. I usually try not to laugh with her, not because I had become a stoic husk, but because I wanted to hear my beautiful girlfriend\u2019s wonderful laugh, see her head pull back and her snoot open up and belt out a fantastic guffaw. Every time she reacted to anything, it was like a gift from Raptor Jesus Himself, and I loved examining it like an art appreciation student.\n\n\u201cHAHAHAHA\u201d Fang threw her head back and screamed in laughter as the sitcom character pushed out a relatable TV friendly line.\n\nI smiled and couldn\u2019t help myself, planting a kiss on her cheek immediately after she calmed down from her burst of laughter.\n\nFang turned a pinkish hue and brought her gorgeous snoot down, looking up at me like a shy puppy.\n\n\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d She cooed in a sweet childish voice.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help myself when I see you laugh\u201d I said. \u201cAll I want to do is hug and kiss you and make you blush\u201d\n\nFang\u2019s smile became coyer, and she cheekily hummed as she brought her wonderful face to mine.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help yourself, huh?\u201d \n\nShe slowly closed her eyes and brought her snoot up to my lips, and I met her beautiful mouth with my own, feeling like my heart was going to burst from sheer excitement. \n\nI woke up the next morning to an obnoxious brightness burning my face, groaning softly and attempting to shift myself into a slightly more comfortable position. I look down at my chest, my sweet little woman breathing softly, still deeply in sleep.\n\nTo this day I continue to hate myself for what I did when we were younger, for what I said and for how I acted. I made us both suffer needlessly and wished every day that I could\u2019ve taken it all back. But when I look at Fang, my heart soars and I only think about making it up to her, every day until the day we die. I carefully rummage through my pocket and hold the tiny box, within it one of the most important pieces of rock that I\u2019ve ever held. I think forward to our upcoming date to the pier, how I\u2019ll wait until she least expects it, how I\u2019ll make myself the most vulnerable I\u2019ve ever been in my life.\n\n\u201cWake up, stinky\u201d I gently sing as I nudge the love of my life with my shoulder.\n\n\u201cMmm\u201d she moans tiredly. \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d\n\n\u201cGet a shower and let\u2019s hit the pier, Tracy\u2019s stand should be open by now\u201d I tell her.\n\n\u201cFiiine\u201d she yawns, \u201cI\u2019m gonna take all the hot water though\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI love cold showers\u201d I say as I puff out my chest valiantly.\n\nFang chuckles and kisses me on my neck. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a tough one ain\u2019t ya?\u201d she mockingly says as she gets up.\n\nI smile at her, feigning confidence as my stomach churns. I watch her strip and admire her lithe form, trying my best to hold back just this once so I can focus on my possible ascent into an emotional firing squad.\n\n\u201cWhat do you wanna do after lunch?\u201d She calls from the bathroom.\n\nI smile to myself, looking down at the ring and hoping that all the forces of the universe will help carry me on this day. \n\n\u201cI think a nice walk would do us some good\u201d I call back.","Title":"Unbroken Love","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"War Season.txt":{"path":["Anon","War Season.txt"],"text":"Title: War Season\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nWar Season\n\t\nDad seemed disappointed but hardly surprised when I told him I planned to go into the service after school.\nSomething about how he couldn't expect more from someone like me.\nThe only other thing resembling encouragement was a simple, \"Keep yourself alive\".\nFucking goober.\n\nLucy on the other hand... well she understood, that's all I'll mention about that.\n\nI guess the biggest surprise was all the people here who seemed like shitposters.\nMight have fallen into my old ways a bit; doesn't help we get good internet access even in desertfuck nowhere.\nLeast I got \/fit\/ I suppose.

I had made this journey a hundred times over since my transfer to Volcano High, and I was practically on autopilot. As I turn the corner, I nearly run into someone else walking down the sidewalk. \n\u201c\u2018Scuse me,\u201d my mutter before I go to move on. The person I nearly bumped into steps in front of me. They\u2019re wearing a long black trench coat and a hat that went out of fashion nearly a century ago. \n\u201cYou Anon?\u201d His voice is rough, raspy and moderately accented. Raptor Jesus, not this shit. Not today. My hand tightly grips the knife in my pocket. \n\u201cNot interested in whatever you\u2019re selling. Move.\u201d \n\u201cI think you should be.\u201d The right half of his coat shifts to the side and the barrel of a gun pokes out, pointed straight at my chest. A jolt shoots across my spine, and my entire body freezes in place. A pair of footsteps sounds behind me, and something dark is draped over my head and wrapped taut around my neck, blocking my vision and threatening to strangle me. I try to struggle but the bag yanks my head backwards and someone jabs me in the kidney, forcing me to my knees. A car rolls up to the curb. A door opens, I\u2019m practically thrown inside and it closes behind me. \n\nI don\u2019t know how long I rode in that car, but eventually it comes to a stop and the door opens again. I\u2019m dragged out and lead around by the neck for a while, then forced to sit in some sort of chair. A pair of straps come around my wrists and latch me in before the bag is finally removed. The room is large, dark save for a single, dim light from above, and mostly empty, each sound echoing off of the walls multiple times. Front and center of me is an aging, brown Tyrannosaurus wearing a pinstripe suit and staring me down with a cold fury, as well as at least half a dozen other figures standing around us. \n\u201cU-Uncle Moe?\u201d He leans over and one of his tiny arms strikes me across the face.\n\u201cYou\u2019se eva call me dat again, and I swea\u2019 on my life I\u2019ll stick ya like a damn pig.

Moe brings his voice down to just above a whisper. \n\u201cGood. Good. Now, onta business.

Ya know what happens to punks that lie to ol\u2019 Uncle Moe, right?\u201d To accentuate his point, Moe moves behind one of his cohorts and then returns, dropping a pair of buckets right in front of me, smelling of...cement mix? \n\u201cN-No sir, Mister Moe, I\u2019m...not lying.\u201d My voice is almost impossible to keep steady, my panic rising with every second spent in this place.\n\u201cAhh, good, good. We\u2019d have a problem if you we\u2019re. And ya treatin\u2019 my lil\u2019 princess good, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf...of course, mister Moe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYa sure, punk? Cuz if I was to \u2018ere \u2018bout some punk treatin\u2019 my lil\u2019 princess poorly\u2026\u201d He trails off, certain that my imagination would be much worse than any threat he could come up with.\n\u201cY-yes\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, you\u2019se don\u2019t sound so sure to me. I mean, would\u2019ja really be \u2018ere right now if\u2019n ya did nothin\u2019 wrong?\u201d Moe\u2019s voice is gleefully malicious, like he enjoys threatening people with gruesome deaths. \n\u201cIf\u2019n I heard that some punk was out dere pumpin\u2019 and dumpin\u2019 my Lucy, dere\u2019d be Hell to pay, see?\u201d The silhouettes all echoed Moe\u2019s \u2018see\u2019 with their own \u2018yeah, see?\u2019\nI\u2019m being accused of pumping and dumping someone even though I\u2019m a virgin.

I\u2019m pretty good at joggin\u2019 folk\u2019s memories, ya know?\u201d He snaps his fingers, and one of the figures runs off into the room, returning with a wheeled cart. The cart is littered with all sorts of sharp implements, pliers, wrenches, and other tools. He picks up a metal grabber and holds it up to the dim light, his grin growing as he surveys it. It makes a menacing clacking noise as he toys with it. His gaze turns back towards me, filling me with abject terror. \n\u201cHow \u2018bout now, punk? Know what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 \u2018bout now? Or am I gunna have ta get \u2018creative\u2019?\u201d My panic crescendos at all the implications of that last word and I reflexively scream.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mister Moe!\u201d\n\u201cSorry for what, punk?!\u201d Moe screams in reply.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for pumping and dumping Lucy!\u201d I shut my eyes and prepare for the worst. I can only hope my confession soothes Moe\u2019s bloodlust enough to make it quick.\nMoe\u2019s fist bangs on the cart, causing all of the implements to clatter, and then a deep, hearty and mirthful uproar erupts from Moe. His assistants join soon after, all offering their chuckles and guffaws at my upcoming death. Seconds feel like minutes, filled with a terrible cacophony of laughter all directed at me.\n\u201cYa see boys? That\u2019s why ya\u2019s gots ta be careful with dese kinds\u2019a interrogations.\u201d Moe leans over me, undoing the straps around my wrists, still chuckling to himself. \n\u201cYa scare someone good enough, they\u2019ll say anythin\u2019 ya want. Even if it ain\u2019t true.\u201d He yanks me out of the chair and pulls me into the best hug he could manage, pounding his fist into my back.\n\u201cWelcome to da Family, Anon!\u201d\n","Title":"Welcome To The Family","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Moe and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"SurpriseVisitor"},"Welcomings.txt":{"path":["Anon","Welcomings.txt"],"text":"Title: Welcomings\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Amber, Naser, Ripley, Samantha, Trish, Reed, Naomi\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n   Twenty-one was the number that had managed to register within the frenzied visual processing of the man as the hurried medical entourage entered the facility's delivery room along with the stretcher that carried his urgently expectant spouse and the precious passenger that lay within her. The sprawling medical complex would have confounded him with its enormity in comparison to the modestly-sized coastal city of Volcadera, had there not been several dozen other causes of much more critical alarm that forced themselves to the forefront of his immediate attention. \n\n\tThe halls were a uniform marble white, homogenous and sterile, and the utilitarian fluorescent lights affixed to the ceilings hummed together in a dull and consistent chorus that pacified errant sounds into a grounding equilibrium. Aromas of cleaner and disinfectant mingled to exude their distinct scents, providing testimony to their work in maintaining the pristineness of the glossy floors, not easily sullied by the commotion that had briefly disturbed the hallways' tranquil stasis. Evening summer sunlight leaked through the building's windows, yellow and orange rays streaming forth in an auroral procession that cast the whole hospital in a faint haze of luminous gold. Outside and further still, above the horizon where the crystal clear water of the coast sparkled in the midst of darker clouds, the descending sun had began to give way to looming indigo sky. The vibrant complimentary colors of this vast firmament set themselves around the building's walls as a persistent backdrop which isolated it from the settlements beyond.\n\n\tInside the delivery room on the bed lay the woman, presided over closely by her husband. He, a younger and taller man, matured but still in possession of his youth's last vestiges, dressed in a green jacket thrown over a plain white shirt and weathered denim jeans all fastened in obvious haste, and thoroughly human. She, nearly the same age has him, a long-snouted pterodon woman, coated in pale whitish-blue feathers with a head of brilliant opaline hair, both now fairly tousled from recent stresses. She wore only a white gown which hung loosely over her lithe reptilian form, and from her back hung two feathered silver wings of majestic span. The gleaming amber jewels of her eyes resonated with the setting sun's pervading rays when they were not screwed shut from the mounting pain of her body's immanent labor.\n\n\tSurrounding the pair were several medical staff members, all of them various forms of bipedal ancient reptilian, conformed to the general body plan of their anthropoid counterparts. Their scales and feathers alike were naturally decorated with an array of vibrant colors, a measured contrast with the more restrained shades of their patient. Towards the upper right corner of the room's far wall was emblazoned an ornate painting of the Eternal Son's twin incarnations, the green-scaled upright raptor and the bearded Galilean carpenter, accompanied by their respective crucifixes of stone and wood, a massive golden halo in the background encompassing both heads to emphasize the unity of their Person. The author of life had grown from this Earth two races of rational creatures fit to partake in the spiritual reality, and had paid the price of carrying His cross along two separate Golgothas to ensure their reconciliation to Himself. \n\n\tThe only person of primate descent within the room scanned his eyes anxiously across the walls of the bustling room and along the ceiling's bright white lights, whose stark glow pierced his vision with mild discoloration. Rapid motion and the muttered medical terminology of the staff clouded around the edges of his awareness as competing streams of thought collided against one another within the frantic landscape of his mind. \n\n\tHis cone of vision fell once again upon the pterodon woman to which he was wed, her elongated face darkened by the mounting pain which heralded the initiation of the birthing process, feathered limbs and slender torso now made to look disproportionate in light of her strained and bulging abdomen. The woman's body gave off the appearance of unmistakable strain. The man's heart pounded with growing tension, his limbs jittering against the edges of the metal edges of the bed which his fingers grasped with a desperate tightness.\n\n\tJoy and buzzing excitement had dominated the months leading up to the expected time when his spouse's pregnancy would finally come to term, a flurry of exorbitant purchases and preparations for their approaching new lives as parents about which they fondly speculated with an almost ceaseless elation. That had changed for the man as the appointed time drew nearer. \n\n\tIn recent weeks there arose first as soft murmuring shadows and then as increasingly more insistent intrusive patterns a spectre of dread that loomed silently above the celebratory atmosphere which otherwise monopolized the time spent with the mother of his unborn child. The body of their offspring which developed within the woman's guarded womb had been carefully monitored since a short time after its conception, various medical experts tirelessly checking for any harmful irregularities. So far, they had found none. The siring of hybrid children by human and dinosaur couplings was rare, but hardly unheard of; the doctors had not been fumbling blindly in their evaluations.\n\n\tSuch assurances in regular checkups and months of additional training had, for most of the man's experience of awaiting his first child, done their part in assuaging potential anxieties about any threats posed to the two most important people in his life who for the time being physically bound to one another in the inescapably vicarious nature of the prenatal process - but now they had started to falter under churning black tendrils of worry and doubt. \n\n\tThe latter stages of the woman's parturiency had left him with pressing images of her body's fragility. Her feathers had more often grown slick with sweat, and exhaustion reigned over her for long hours of each day. Numerous varying pains rose to increasing prominence as her body's biological systems were pushed to their highest limits, and the frequency of her discomfort often caused her to become irritable and sensitive. Pregnancy was difficult, and childbirth was dangerous. The sights of his partner's straining form ignited within him unwanted notions of bodily danger befalling her or the tiny child within her, which had recently taken to tormenting him in moments where he allowed his thoughts to wander, as they currently were. Worst-case scenarios of mortal terror instantaneously simulated themselves without invitation in his mind's eye, forcefully dragging him into the contemplation of possibilities too awful to name.\n\n\tSo engrossed was the man in his own spiraling and panicked preoccupations that he failed entirely to hear the first several instances of the soft feminine voice calling his name until their gradually rising volume culminated in a forceful exclamation:\n\n\t\"Hey! Earth to you! Anybody home?\"\n\n\tBriskly, the man was jarringly reinstated back into the present moment. Doctors around the room still strode quickly from place to place, retrieving arrays of medical apparel, solutions of unknown chemicals, and various tools of which he could only reliably name a scant few. His eyes locked with his wife's glittering orange counterparts, and he saw that she was awaiting an acknowledgment. \n\n\t\"Sorry, Fang,\" he responded, as soon as words returned to him, calling his beloved by the embarrassing nickname which she had taken up in their senior year of high school. She preferred to go by her real name, which was Lucy, but they had both long since accepted the sentimental value that frivolous alias held for both of them. \"I'm just getting nervous,\" he confessed, and his voice cracked slightly in spite of himself as he continued, \"I'm just shaking a little. I'm okay.\"\n\n\t\"Listen, I'M the one who's about to give birth here, not you,\" she teased with her familiar abrasive form of levity. Seeing the tension that coursed through him and the stress plainly apparent on his face, her tone softened and she added more earnestly, \"One of us has to stay calm in this, and we both know I'm not-\"\n\n\t\"FUCK!\" \n\n\tThe profane squawk caused the man's ears to ring as Lucy's face contorted into its tightest expression of pain yet seen, eyes screwed shut and lengthy snout hanging open as a much fainter whine of discomfort emitted from it. The surrounding medical staff clearly took this as an urgent call to begin their work, and they drew closer to the sprawled out woman on the bed as she went into labor.\n\n\tThe next sequence of events came to the man in a barrage, loud and bright and rapid and overwhelming to all his senses. Struggling to heed his wife's instruction, he steeled himself against the haywire panic seething in the background noise of his mental environment and recalled with his best efforts the training which he and his spouse had undertaken to prepare for this very moment. He held Lucy's clawed hand tightly, and she grasped his even tighter, first only strong and then escalating into a sharp vice grip that dug into his skin as the contractions began and intensified. \n\n\tBetween the screeching tapestry of obscenity that was involuntarily woven by Lucy in the throes of physical agony, her husband attempted to remind her to breathe as they had rehearsed; an especially difficult task when she was preoccupied with the act of gracing all present with the ear - or bodily equivalent thereof - shattering cries of combinations of profanities which may have been yet unheard until that day. How much time had elapsed from when the delivery began was currently impossible to gauge, for any proper sense of duration was buried beneath the chaotic volume each solitary contraction. \n\n\tOnly in the vaguest sense was the man aware of the blood which his wife's claws had inadvertently drawn as her nerves were bathed in searing fire by the incomparable pains of childbirth, and even then the miniscule realization was quickly dispelled from his direct focus by another shrieking scream of such high and piercing intensity that it bounced around inside of his head, dizzying him by proxy from its sheer amplitude. How he had managed to hear and comprehend the voice of the doctor announcing that the baby was crowning, he had no explanation.\n\n\tThe man was not quite able to hear his own words as he encouraged Lucy to keep pushing, that it was almost there, but he knew that something must have left his mouth because the doctor followed suit, smiling in excitement in spite of his visible physical weariness. Lucy's spouse watched as her exhausted body tightened like a corkscrew, and she flooded the delivery room with a final skull-rattling scream, the loudest din of the entire affair, before she pushed once more with all of her body's remaining strength and strained herself to her absolute limit until the wail of their infant daughter graced all present in the room. The doctor held the crying baby in his arms to the accompaniment of gently elated cooing and laughter. The girl was clearly far more pterodon than simian, and her mother's outward traits were even now apparent as having taken precedence over those of her father. Tiny feathered wings twitched gently as the child's crying continued, her long snout opened widely. \n\n\tAs the doctor cut the umbilical cord, a frail Lucy collapsed limp back onto the medical bed's cushioning, a soft smile on her exhausted snouted face. Hair frayed and drenched in sweat, she looked back to her husband, her grip loosened and then finally broken as her hand returned to her side. Her husband came close to smiling, but it dawned on him that something was wrong. Lucy was pale and drained, barely able to keep her eyes open, her face pallid. Her voice airy and thin - too thin, too quiet - she weakly raised shaking feathered arms and one bloodstained hand while asking to hold her baby girl. Whispers of dread prowled just beyond the boundary of her husband's conscious mind, poised to lunge like an anticipating predatory beast. \n\n\tShe held the child in her arms, her now-ragged orange gems of eyes looking upon the wailing long-snouted infant with all the love in the world even as her weakening arms shook with greater and greater intensity. Her voice coming now only as a fading whisper, she paused for only a moment of consideration before breathing the name she would give to the girl she had just brought forth.\n\n\t\"Amber...\"\n\n\tIt was one of the nurses present in the room that had first noticed Lucy's dangerously weakened grip on the infant and she darted forward to take the wailing child into her own grasp just as its mother's arms finally fell completely limp against the edges of the bed. The pale pterodon woman's head dropped listlessly against the pillow as her eyes finally lost their power to remain open, and before the rapid succession of events could even be processed by her husband the horrible and harsh beeping of a hospital alarm descended upon the delivery room in a cacophony more unwelcome than the most deafening scream. \n\n\n\n\tThe apparent realness of the unreal situation unfolding before him finally managed to reconcile itself within the man's psyche as the medical staff shouted about rupture and scrambled to wheel his wife into surgery, and without semblance of proper cognition he exclaimed in terror the affectionate name he used for his beloved. As his wife's motionless form was taken away from the room a nurse gripped him in order to prevent the advance towards the receding procession to the surgery wing that he had not even been consciously aware his legs were making, and while he was pulled back the fear and horror that had lingered for weeks finally also pounced upon his mind with all its paralyzing might.\n\n\tAll of the worries and anxieties that had for weeks up until now been festering within him now looked to be actualizing themselves in front of him, and he himself was helpless to affect anything as everything splintered apart. That which he feared most out of anything and which he considered above all the unimaginable worst case scenario was playing itself out in front of him beyond the confines of the hypothetical, and he could not will it away. The nurse was attempting to speak to him now, but he could not make out any words; reality right now was nothing but a prison of light and noise from which he desperately wanted to escape.\n\n\tHis chest was heavy and his heart pounded painfully against his chest with uncanny rapidity, his legs unmoving as stone and his arms numb. He could not quite seem to tell if he was breathing at all right now, or if he was currently on the path to hyperventilation. The wailing of his neonate daughter which had been a persistent audial presence since its emergence into the room finally registered within his sphere of comprehension simultaneously with the complete realization of the situation into which life had trapped him:\n\n\tHe was losing Lucy.\n\n\tThe woman he loved, the only woman who he had ever loved, his wife, his life partner, his best friend, who he had spent countless hours and countless nights with, and who he had made love with, and who he had wanted to spend the rest of his life with, who was the light of his life, the one who would be the mother of his child. And the potential was now starkly real that he might never see her again. \n\n\tLucy, who he had met in his senior year of high school when they were both foolish and confused outcasts, when she was lost and directionless and scared and trying harder than anything to pretend she wasn't, when he was lonely and weary and unfamiliar and trying to shut the world out, and they had found each other, and taught each other to grow, and taught each other to love. Lucy, who had carried his battered humiliated self across entire blocks during the most embarrassing day of his life after someone threw an empty can at him and he had clumsily tripped down the school's stairs trying to catch it in mid-air. Lucy, who had stunned him the first time he saw her in her prom dress and stunned him every day afterwards too no matter what she wore. Lucy, who still always wrote her name on every bag of dino-nuggies. Lucy, who loved music with her heart and soul, whose tail was always tapping away to some imagined beat in that wonderful mind of hers, who had taught him how to play guitar, and who would always volunteer to play at church whenever she was needed because a happy audience was more than enough payment. Lucy, whose eyes he would gladly be lost in for an eternity.\n\n\tHe turned, slowly, to the child, his child. Lucy's child. The child who might now have to grow up without ever meeting her mother. Whose family would be forever incomplete and broken. Lucy had wanted so much to be a mother, and this child she had loved with her whole being before it had even exited her womb. And now they were at the precipice of being separated forever. Looking now upon the infant who was attended to by the nurses remaining in the room, the man saw that the strength to bring up this child alone was not something he possessed. Should his wife on this day be taken from him, he did not foresee any possible way of returning to the empty house he and his beloved had bought for their life together with his soul intact. He knew in fact that it would kill him. \n\n\tThe countless moments of his life with his lover sustained the integrity of his whole person, and now all those moments lay before the approaching swing of the axe that lowered itself with destructive intent. Lucy's husband realized now more clearly than at any other previous instance in his life that he loved his wife with all his soul, and all his soul would be carried off with her wherever she went. He would die with her, and he could not change that fact even if he wished to, which he did not. That love he had surrendered himself wholly to until there was no distinction between it and him, and to him this was truly what love was: to surrender one's self completely to another. \n\n\tHis eyes had not left the child. If her mother would here perish, there would be only a shell left to raise her. The family that she would have had would never be available to her as it was, and she would have no other option but to find unsullied joy elsewhere. Without Lucy, he could never be the father to his child that he knew he needed to be. \n\n\tHow little had anything mattered to him here and now than his family, than his Lucy. How unfathomably stupid it had been for him to have ever fretted over material concerns or daily inconveniences or meandering social squabbles when all that he had ever needed was this love. How could there ever be the slightest possibility of a so-called \"bad day\" or be any \"bad luck\" when his family was there? All the world's riches were rags compared with having Lucy and her baby girl in front of him. God how he wanted to live. \n\n\tGod almighty, he thought as his eyes drifted over to the painting on the wall of the Savior, I'll give anything for them. Take everything else away if you must but just let my Lucy live and hold her baby girl in her arms and be the mother I know you made her to be. Jesus Christ please just take me instead if you have to but I just want to live and being with her is the only way I can. Didn't you have a mother? You have to understand. Please. Please Lord.\n\n\tThe child was silent now under the care of the nurses and the male voice of the doctor calling its father's name cut through the dread quiet like a diamond bullet. The father's legs ached from standing and his arms were frozen at his sides like metal rods. His chest to his gut felt like a gaping pit and his breath was uneven. He faced away from the doctor, and there was an acute pause before he began his slow turn towards the medical professional.\n\n\tHere in this moment was the bridge between life and death, and the man did not yet know on which side he stood.\n\n\tTersely, the doctor requested the man to follow him, and they stepped out of the delivery room's doorway just as the child within began again to softly wail. Several steps down the hallway were taken to begin the journey to the surgery wing before the man was once again able to form and enunciate words, and he managed to haltingly choke out the necessary phrase that would communicate his inquiry to the doctor.\n\n\t\"Is she alright?\"\n\n\tThe instant between his question and the doctor's answer was a harrowing chasm, a darkened valley of anticipation, anxiety, dread, suspense, and most painfully of all, hope. This quarter second of time was traversed by the man with all the struggle of climbing a mountain, and when he had reached the other side of the miniscule temporal gap he was in a state of even greater emotional exhaustion.\n\n\t\"Yes. She's stable.\"\n\n\tThere were other words spoken after that; there must have been, at least, since the doctor's mouth was moving and sound was certainly coming out, but those words did not come to the man. As soon as he was able to grasp what had been said to him, and for the briefest possible fragment of time rejoice and praise God, there was only one other word that he had been able to wheeze in his ecstatic shock:\n\n\t\"W-where?!\"\n\n\tWithout listening to the doctor's response, he half-sprinted towards the destination whose exact location he did not currently know, and the older white-coated stegosaurus man struggled to catch up ahead of him to guide him to his wife's room, sputtering a few halfhearted admonitions to slow down and remain calm. Eventually the doctor was able to show the man to the proper room, by which point he had been given quite a bit more exercise than his profession usually entailed, huffing profusely. He gestured wordlessly to the door frame as he caught his breath, and inside the man saw again the love of his life lying in bed, alive. Alive.\n\n\tAn IV drip stuck out from her feathered arm and multiple monitors had been affixed to her chest. She wore a new gown, the one she had delivered in presumably being discarded during surgical complications, and a light blanket had been drawn up to about her waist. She was still pale, but the complexion was no longer deathly in its amount of lost pigment, and the strain that had marred her face before was now gone, replaced with an expression of calm serenity with only the mildest hint of annoyance courtesy of the tall conical translucent device that had been affixed around her long snout with a tube that fed down beneath the bed - what he quickly surmised was an oxygen mask, designed for the unique proportions of a pterodon's facial features. Her lulled eyes immediately widened somewhat when she caught sight of her husband.\n\n\t\"Honey...\" she cooed softly, and he was at her side in an instant. He could not say anything at first, and for a moment settled only on touching her, trying to assure himself that this was real. Slowly she raised one hand to cover his on her shoulder. He stared for a long moment into her shining citrine eyes and the sight was nothing short of beatific. Here lay his priceless feathered angel, and she was alive. Eventually, speech returned to him.\n\n\t\"Lucy,\" he breathed, \"Oh god, Lucy...\", and the air leaving his lungs deflated the tension in his body in one rapid motion, and he fell to his knees beside her. \n\n\t\"Are you okay?\" he whispered. \"Is everything alright?\"\n\n\t\"I just got a bit tired, honey, that's all. I'm okay now,\" she intoned softly, her voice still thin and hoarse but no longer the fading rattle that it had been when she had first fallen ill. Her clawed thumb traced itself gently along the rough skin of his hand.\n\n\t\"She suffered some substantial blood loss, actually,\" interjected the still-winded doctor as he entered closer into the room behind them, \"As well as internal bleeding, quite a bit of rupturing that had to be dealt with... your wife was in serious condition, Mr. Mous. She's a very lucky woman.\"\n\n\t\"Luck's got nothing to do with it,\" murmured Lucy with a faint smirk. She turned her eyes back to her husband, expecting a small smile that matched her own, only to find her husband's face pallid and sullen. \n\n\t\"I thought...\", he began, before the words momentarily caught in his throat, \"I thought I might've lost you, Lucy...\"\n\n\t\"You think you could get rid of me that easily?\" she quipped hoarsely, in the briefest instant before she realized the full sincerity of her husband's words. Then her expression became tender and her eyes grew glassy, gazing with sympathy upon her husband's bloodshot ones. Without any further explanation she understood the extent of what had transpired within him during the past several hours, and she raised the other hand not holding his own up around his shoulder, squeezing the hand she held tightly.\n\n\t\"Oh, baby...\" she whispered, \"Come here... come here, baby...\"\n\n\tHis head fell slowly into her chest, and she brought the hand that had been around his shoulder up to his head, stroking his hair gently as she brought her snout as close as possible to his cheek while encumbered by the oxygen mask. \n\n\t\"It's okay,\" she repeated in hushed tones, \"I'm here... I'm here... It's okay...\"\n\n\tThe emotional dam finally broke and she felt hot tears fall against her bosom as he began to weep heavily against her, squeezing her hand as hard as he could without risking her harm. She continued to hold him against her and they remained in such a position for a long, long time.\n\n\n\n\tWhen her husband had finally been able to let go of her, Lucy was already eager to see her baby girl; her usual energy was returning to her with astonishing rapidity, and color had already made its way back into her complexion. It did not take the medical staff particularly long to learn how quickly Lucy's temper could be aroused when she was denied something she favored, and it was not long at all before they were rushing to bring the woman her child. Her husband had already known the extent of her wrath that could be expended on stolen dino-nuggies alone, and her daughter was infinitely more valuable to her than dino-nuggies. \n\n\tHer oxygen mask had already been done away with against the insistence of the nurses as she received her swaddled baby girl, and she crooned with unfiltered delight at the precious child in her arms: already clearly the spitting image of her mother. Amber squeaked out a happy little noise entirely dissimilar to her previous cries, and Lucy looked upon her daughter's eyes - perfect replicas of her own - with the purest beaming radiance of maternal love. Her husband was brought into the fold of this practical madonna by her slowly outstretched wings, of which one came to pull him closer to her and another rested protectively over her offspring. He would truthfully have had no qualms staying like this for as long as she liked, but eventually he was compelled to suggest the inevitable.\n\n\t\"We need to call your parents,\" he began, \"and tell them about what happened.\"\n\n\tLucy's eyes dilated into what her husband could have sworn were veritable pinpricks as the color in her face that had gradually replenished evacuated from it all over again. \n\n\t\"No,\" she pleaded, \"no way. You can tell them about Amber, but you CANNOT tell them about me. Mom will flip her shit. You've never seen my mom when she's upset.\"\n\n\tA momentary confusion struck the man as he pondered why she had mentioned her mother, and not her father. Surely, he assumed, there was far more of a terrifying reaction to fear from that hulking ex-cop than Lucy's saintly old waif of a mother. Regardless, he persisted.\n\n\t\"Come on, Fang, they're your parents. They care about you,\" he reminded her, trying his hardest to ignore the latent sting of lacking such a luxury almost in its entirety from his own guardians.\n\n\t\"I know!\" she exclaimed, \"that's exactly why we can't tell them!\"\n\n\t\"They're going to find out eventually even if we don't tell them,\" he chided, \"and when they do, it'll just make them more upset that we hid it from them.\"\n\n\t\"...Fine,\" Lucy relented, \"but YOU'RE making the phone call.\"\n\n\tHe could accept those terms. Stepping out of the room and navigating towards a suitably isolated area of the facility, he settled upon a small alcove with a single chair and small table, situated next to a large window which let in the full vista of the crystalline shore and the last reddish-orange rays of the setting sun which illuminated the whole area's interior with a gentle amber glow.\n\n\tThe name Lucy had chosen for their daughter truly couldn't be more fitting.\n\n\tHe waited patiently as the phone rung on the other end of the line, still immeasurably thankful that he had not been forced to make a much different call to his in-laws today. The signature click of a received call sounded and shortly after he was greeted with the voice of his mother-in-law.\n\n\t\"Hello! You've reached the Aarons!\" chirped the sugary sweet voice made slightly tinny by the modulation of the cell phone. Waves audibly crashed in the background, the phone's limited sound capacity rendering their rhythmic tidal comings and goings an indistinct and fuzzy ambience to the call. Mr. and Mrs. Aaron were currently across state lines on a scheduled vacation, but they had been waiting in eager anticipation for news on arrival of their granddaughter. He had managed very briefly to call them earlier on the trip to the hospital to inform them of Lucy's immanent labor, and so they had most certainly been expecting a swift followup.\n\n\tThe older couple contrasted one another like the sun and moon. Mrs. Aaron was a tiny pterodon woman hardly standing over five-feet tall, her feathered form a near exact match to her daughter's pale whitish-blue with light golden hair an a gracefully-aged snouted face. Around the house she practically always wore an apron, and visits to the Aaron residence were more often than not punctuated by the scent of freshly-baked cookies on account of her culinary talents. A kinder-hearted lady of the house Volcadera had perhaps not seen in all its time. Mr. Aaron, on the other hand, towered in height over his wife, a titanic brown-scaled dragon of a man whose rugged form was testament to a robust physical strength which age had done little to temper. His living room was decorated with his hunting trophies and his son-in-law was half certain that he possessed enough firearms to be on some kind of government watchlist. He was curt and dignified, a respected member of his community and an honored former police officer, but God help anyone who would harm a feather on the head of his Lucy.\n\n\tThey were quirky and they were a handful, but they loved their two children more than the world, and could not help but dote upon both even now when they were grown adults. Lucy and her slightly younger brother Naser were the subjects of an unconditional parental love that was an almost entirely alien concept to their daughter's husband. They had been family to him these past several years more than his own had parents had ever been, who had not deigned even to attend their own son's wedding. He found in them a network of genuine support that he had spent the majority of his life to that point unfamiliar with - a particularly impressive accomplishment when one recalled that Mr. Aaron had surreptitiously threatened to murder him with a golf club on their first meeting.\n\n\t\"Hi, Samantha,\" he answered, and she immediately exclaimed his name over the other end of the line in excitement.\n\n\t\"Is that you, dear?\" Her tone grew even more cheerful as she recognized the voice of her son-in-law. She was audibly bubbling with elation. \"Oh, oh! One moment sweetie, let me get Ripley on!\"\n\n\tHe heard fainter in the background Mrs. Aaron calling the name of her husband, and even over the digitized soundscape of the phone he could hear the massive man's heavy footsteps as he approached. The man briefly considered the best way to phrase his explanation of what had transpired over the past few hours, one which would not alarm his spouse's parents.\n\n\t\"Okay, you're on speaker, dear!\" rang Samantha's voice again, and a moment later it was followed up with the rough and deep voice of her husband addressing his son-in-law by name.\n\n\t\"You there, son?\" he inquired joyfully, \"How are my baby girls doing?\"\n\n\t\"They're great. They're both... they're both doing great.\" Involuntarily the man grew choked up in a flurry of emotion for a brief moment before he was able to continue. How blessed was he, to be able to say those words right now. \"The kid's beautiful. She has Lucy's eyes. I can't wait for you to see her.\"\n\n\tA high-pitched squeal of unabated joy sounded from Samantha, and she let out a short peel of ecstatic laughter. \"Ahhh, I'm a grandmother! I can't believe it! We're grandparents, Ripley, my God, can you believe it?!\"\n\n\tThere was a pronounced pause from Ripley, who was evidently taking in the reality that he was a grandfather and required several seconds to square himself with that fact. Then he joined in his wife's infectious laughter, and his cheerful bark sounded in his son-in-law's ear.\n\n\t\"Our little Lucy made us grandparents!\"\n\n\tThe sound of dainty feathery hands clapping together signified Samantha's giddy energy from audio alone, and she closed in on her phone, apparently forgetting momentarily that she had put it on speaker, and the sound of her next slightly-too-loud request reminded the man of the other important matter he had yet to address.\n\n\t\"Can you put our little Lucy on, dear? I want to talk to her, she must be overjoyed! Oh, I can still remember when I held my little baby in my arms...\"\n\n\t\"Well,\" he began slowly, and he breathed in deeply before continuing, \"She's doing fine, but I'm not in the room with her right now. There were, uh, some complications during delivery and we had a bit of an emergency, but-\"\n\n\tHis arm had reflexively jerked the phone away from his ear before he had even fully consciously processed the ear-piercing squawk that emitted from its speakers and which was still entirely audible from over a foot away. Samantha's unbroken stream of furious shrieks echoed into the hospital hallways from the device, earning more than a few curious glances from nearby staff and visitors as the man, in futility, attempted to calm the frenzying woman on the other end with assurances that her daughter was safe. Such high-pitched sound and fury blared from his cell phone's meager speakers that the audio had started to distort from the stress of such consistently thundering volume, and he could only vaguely make out the telltale vocalizations of Mr. Aaron practically cowering from his wife in the background.\n\n\tBefore long there were noises through the device of some indecipherable physical commotion which resounded with a series of loud impacts heard against a host of surfaces, objects being tossed about as if he were listening to a recording of a hurricane. Trying to extrapolate coherent speech from such a cacophony was obviously a herculean task, though the man did manage to make out a few words from the persistently screeching matriarch which included such phrases as \"MY LUCY\", \"RIPLEY\", \"BABY\", and \"AIRPORT\". The frenetic auditory mayhem came to a crescendo before the phone abruptly hung up; whether this was because the option to end the call had been selected or the phone had been promptly smashed into countless fragments was impossible to discern.\n\n\tHe re-entered the doorway of his wife's room with a low and heavy sigh, and she glanced at him quizzically for a moment before opening her mouth to ask the question which she already knew the answer to:\n\n\t\"How did it go?\"\n\n\tHer husband's eyes widened briefly before he took another prolonged breath inward and took another step towards the bed where his wife and child lay.\n\n\t\"It went... well, I think,\" he muttered unconvincingly, the room's ceiling conspicuously the immediate object of his visual attention. \"On an, uh... unrelated note, I think we might be getting a visit from your parents soon.\"\n\n\n\n\tThe next scant few hours afforded them the time to situate Lucy out of the surgery wing and into the maternity ward, her insistence quickly wearing down the hesitation of medical staff as signature vitality returned to her in all its splendor. Wrenching Amber from the snugness of her mother's arms was a far greater ordeal, and the nurses trembled as they carefully lifted the precious infant away for a series of routine checkups, the protective maternal intent radiating off of the woman in almost palpable waves. Perhaps, noted her husband, Lucy took far more after her mother than he had yet realized.\n\n\tGolden tangerine sunlight which had bestowed upon Amber her name finally receded into the dark cobalt of a crisp night. Emerging from the expanse of the heavens was the moon, leading behind it all the distant shining spheres of the seven visible planets and the twinkling host of stars whose distant radiance journeyed light-years across vast spaces of creation to light the night sky with their cosmic brilliance. The night took hold of the hospital, and the quiet dark settled against the building's windows. Ethereal lunar light rested gently along the still and clear sea and resonated with the matching pale blue color of Lucy.\n\n\tThe night had only just begun to assert itself over Volcadera for its allotted time when the automatic doors of the hospital were wrenched open by the pint-sized feathered form of one Mrs. Aaron, two large bags in each hand, wings unfurled, and striding forth across the large lobby with untempered ferocity. To her left was Mr. Aaron, his long-scarred face withered in visible exhaustion, clearly struggling to keep pace with his manically determined spouse. On her right stood Lucy's brother Naser, his penchant for wearing gaudy jackets unchanged from his high school years, and looking rather disoriented, as if he were not quite sure of how exactly he had gotten here.\n\n\tRumblings of Samantha's relentless approach made their presence known far before she had reached the maternity ward proper, and various staff members scrambled to stall her hasty and unregulated entry into restricted areas of the hospital - all to no avail. The halls bustled with agitation as Mrs. Aaron squawked and strutted before sputtering doctors, and the image of trained medical professionals quivering in abject fear before a tiny old pterodon lady was a surreal sight which Lucy's husband would not soon forget.\n\n\tQuite quickly did the meager blockades against Mrs. Aaron's advance cede to her fury, and she rushed to the room where her daughter and granddaughter were being held, with the two men of her house silently in tow. Before Lucy could even process the sight of her collected family members, Samantha was barreling towards her bed, bags dropped to the floor in a flash as a squealing cry of \"LUCYLUCYLUCYLUCYLUCYLUCYLUCY\" flooded from her mouth. Lucy's mother poked and pecked at her as her daughter struggled in vain to be heard over the endless stream of worried babbling that fired off from the frenetic Samantha at a hundred words per second. \n\n\tRipley approached cautiously from behind his wife, eyeing her and his daughter carefully before he made his move to speak between Samantha's chaotic rambling and Lucy's futile protestations.\n\n\t\"Darling, I think you might suffocate our daughter.\"\n\n\tSamantha jerked her head back quickly to look at him, arms fully around her exasperated daughter and eyes narrowed, growling at him with her fangs bared like a rabid chihuahua. Ripley flinched and drew back with his open hands raised in a gesture of mock surrender, turning to Naser - who still seemed to be in the process of collecting his bearings - with a somewhat concerned expression. The medical staff appeared to have entirely evacuated from the room, save for a lone nurse who peered in trembling from the doorway, and Lucy's husband had backed cautiously away from his wife's bed in fear of provoking Samantha's wrath.\n\n\t\"MMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMM!!!\" Lucy groaned in a pitch-perfect replication of her teenage plea to an overbearing mother. \"I'm okay! SERIOUSLY!\"\n\n\tMrs. Aaron finally seemed to let up - if only slightly - as she loosened her hold on her daughter and raised her eyes to meet Lucy's. \n\n\t\"Are you sure?\" she asked, quieter now.\n\n\t\"Yes,\" her daughter replied.\n\n\t\"Are you absolutely sure?\"\n\n\t\"Yes!\"\n\n\t\"Are you completely sure?\"\n\n\t\"YES!\"\n\n\tSamantha sighed and closed her eyes, bringing her snout closer to her daughter's and hugging her a little tighter again.\n\n\t\"I'm sorry, honey,\" she mumbled, her tone now tender and gentle, \"You're just... you're my little pirate princess. You know I can't ever stop worrying about my baby. I love you so much.\"\n\n\tLucy hugged her mother back, her eyes watery despite her previous teasing guise of annoyance and kissing her mom's cheek with her long snout. \"I know. I love you too, mom.\"\n\n\t\"Just promise to bring me along next time you decide to give birth, okay?\" her mother giggled softly.\n\n\tHer daughter returned a soft smile in return, but sighed sadly. \"Well, there won't be a next time, actually. They say I can't have another baby after what happened. This one was all I had.\"\n\n\t\"Oh...\" her mother muttered quietly, \"Lucy... I'm so sorry, honey...\"\n\n\tLucy smiled a bit wider and shook her head, her voice coming to her more firmly. \"Don't be. It was all worth it just for her. She's enough.\"\n\n\tAs if on cue, several doctors entered into the room, the single attendant that had been previously keeping watch over the family awkwardly positioning himself out of the way as one of the staff members hesitantly approached Samantha and beckoned her to move back, the primary doctor in the group holding in his arms the treasure to which the whole night belonged. Gingerly, the newly swaddled baby was placed back in her mother's arms.\n\n\tSamantha let out a gasp of pure delight. The child's father approached closer to his wife's bed, smiling uncontrollably at the sight of his daughter. Naser followed suit, and after him Ripley, who upon laying his eyes on his infant granddaughter for the first time produced a high-pitched noise so drastically unlike anything he had made before that it left all present in a state of momentary shock, gazed in wonder at the child for a long while, motionless.\n\n\t\"My God,\" he finally breathed, \"She's beautiful... look at her, Samantha, she's beautiful...\"\n\n\tMrs. Aaron had already drawn her hands over her snout, tears gushing from her quivering eyes. She sounded off a wordless noise of acknowledgment that was something like a sob or a gasp, contemplating the sight of her granddaughter with reverent awe.\n\n\t\"She looks just like you, Lucy,\" Naser choked out, the first clear sentence he'd managed to interject with since his arrival. \"What's her name?\"\n\n\t\"Amber,\" his sister whispered, her eyes not leaving her progeny.\n\n\t\"It's perfect,\" Ripley said quietly. \"That's perfect.\"\n\n\tThe family had been able to eventually speak more openly without the words catching in their throats, and they conversed in a splendid reverie about the child in Lucy's arms. The girl had woken up after a while without any tears, looking for the first time upon her grandparents and uncle with the clear and undifferentiated awareness that can only truly come from the newborn infant and the saint. Ripley's fawning and bubbly babytalk was a stranger event to experience than any of the previous hours' chaotic setpieces, and when Amber had eventually snapped her little beak down on his finger he had joyfully exclaimed that the child was a fighter like grandpa.\n\n\tSamantha reverted back to her usual self in no time, and after a little while of simply admiring the sight of her granddaughter, she was already itching for a round of photos with her newly expanded family. The predictable round of groans that accompanied her announcement of \"picture time\" was tempered only by the fact that she had been instructed on how to take photographs with a phone instead of an analog camera since her daughter's graduation, sparing all present from the need to brace their eyes for a barrage of flashing abuse. Only once she had accidentally exceeded the memory limit of the smartphone was there any reprieve from her ravenous snapshotting. \n\n\n\n\tExcitement still flooded the room long after the arrival of the Aarons, and none of them could think of getting any sleep even as the early hours of the morning went by and the night's end was finally heralded by the shimmering glow of sunrise. Calls of waterside birds made themselves heard even past the filter of the hospital's insulated clinical hum. After breakfast, Naser had managed to get a hold of Trish and Reed, and later Uncle Moe. With his trademark organizational skills, he'd swiftly established a group videochat, the impressive smoothness of his feat only mitigated by Trish's incoherent ecstatic squealing nearly damaging the speakers of the expensive notebook tablet he carried upon her first glance at her best friend's newborn.\n\n\tReed - completely sober for now, thankfully - had taken to writing a whole list of gifts which he planned to send to the girl once she had grown older. Lucy's husband could not quite tell if he was joking with some of the baffling expensive suggestions he made, or if Reed really did have such an exorbitant amount of money which he apparently had no qualms with spending. Uncle Moe's miniscule arms reached towards the screen with such fervor that it almost did seem that he could scoop the infant girl up right there, and he had been the first to draw a true giggle from the baby out of anyone. Rosa and Stella entered into the call soon as well; Rosa frequently slipping into rapid Spanish as she gushed and cooed over the child, and Stella showing an admirable amount of restraint in not attempting to speculate on the girl's star sign. Somehow even Naomi had found her way into the group - how, Naser did not actually know - and had excitedly passed along congratulations from Spears and Farnsworth, which was greatly appreciated. The condescending, passive-aggressive attitude with which she had usually carried herself when they had known her years ago was almost entire absent, although Naser was still eventually forced to mute her audio when she lapsed into a particularly lengthy diatribe about the benefits of vegan diets for babies. \n\n\tWhen the cusp of the late afternoon at least began its transition into a luminous evening sunset quite like the one in which the husband and his pregnant wife had first entered the hospital the previous day, Lucy showed little trace of having been through yesterday's ordeal, aside from a predictable exhaustion and frazzled hair that contrasted with her usually straight locks. After they had finally said goodbye to their friends and room was filled once again with the solar glow that had been Amber's namesake, Lucy was already anxious to take her daughter home. Color and strength replenished, with only a sleepless fatigue and the scars of surgery remaining as evidence of her medical emergency, the doctors had seen fit to discharge her before dark.\n\n\tNaser brandished a clear plastic glass while behind him one of the attendants removed the IV from his sister's arm, and he poured from a can of the hospital's ginger ale into the cup the cheap carbonated nectar which bubbled and foamed gently as it settled against the transparent interior. He turned to where Lucy lay to see nurses and her husband slowly easing her out of the bed, first unsteady on her feet but then quickly finding her footing, a mild sway the only indication from her posture that she had given birth the evening prior. Samantha held Amber securely in her arms, Ripley keeping vigilant watch over the child while her mother steadied herself. When her husband finally let her go and she remained standing firm, Lucy walked slowly towards her mother, who smiled lovingly and offered the sleeping child to her daughter, who nodded and received the baby girl in her arms like a priceless gem. The child was safe and tight in her mother's firm hold.\n\n\tNaser looked upon his gathered family and once they acknowledged his gaze lifted his glass slightly, pausing for a moment before the words came to him and he smiled gently.\n\n\t\"To Lucy and Amber,\" he began slowly, and then turned his eyes to his sister's husband as he continued, \"And to the man I'm proud to call my brother.\"\n\n\tNaser's brother-in-law blinked in mild shock before returning an earnest smile. Lucy then drew him closer to her with her wing, grinning and nuzzling his cheek with her snout. Samantha happily clasped her small hands together and leaned into her daughter as Ripley laid one of his gargantuan hands on the man's shoulder with another coming to rest on Lucy's. Here was a happiness that no money or gold or land or diamonds could buy and the man had received it even undeserving as he was.\n\n\tLucy and her husband strolled through the sunset-lit white halls, carefully guarded by the rest of the family as they carried their offspring into the outside world for the first time. Samantha was practically inseparable from her two little girls, and beside them Ripley quickly filled out assortments of paperwork with one of the staff members. When they had at least reached the building's exit, the task lay before them of removing Samantha from Lucy and Amber, which was eventually accomplished after a hundred admonitions and a hundred reminders for her daughter to call her if she ever needed anything at all. She kissed Lucy, Amber, and the child's father goodbye, and tears were streaming down her aged face all the while. Ripley had pulled his son-in-law into a hug and sincerely thanked him for keeping his baby girl safe, and there was a tear in his eye too, before he prepared to escort his bawling wife back home. \n\n\n\n\tNaser insisted that he drive Lucy, her husband, and the baby home. They had assured him that it wasn't necessary, but he was adamant, and eventually their mutual exhaustion forced them to relent and they accepted that his appraisal of their current ability to drive was correct. He'd already had a carseat for the child on hand, much to their surprise, and his explanation that \"Mom brought it\" answered fewer questions still. Once they had ensured that the child was fastened safely, Lucy took her seat in the back next to where Amber lay and her husband slumped into the passenger seat. Naser started the ignition and the wave of physical tiredness that until now Lucy and her spouse had fought off began to take its toll on them.\n\n\tThe vehicle had not driven far from the hospital before Lucy nodded off, sleeping as peacefully as the baby beside her. Her husband felt his own eyelids grow heavy multiple times as the luminosity of the orange sunset faded into another clear night, the darkness illuminating Volcadera's various sources of light which glowed together in concert with the hum of the car's engine, evoking from the city's streets a dreamlike dance of colored lights that nearly succeeded in carrying the man off to sleep. Naser glanced briefly at the two of them with a smile, and then to his niece who still slept comfortably in the carseat. The car was finally felt to come to a stop and Lucy's husband glanced up to the sight of his house - their house - standing just as they left it, lights still on as they had scrambled to exit it a day prior. \n\n\tNaser tenderly lifted the infant to himself, and Lucy's husband took his spouse up out of the back seat of the car, careful not to disturb her slumber. She was light in his arms and she felt her soft breath against his chest, eyes serenely closed and her face so blissfully free of the stresses which the last evening had subjected her to. His brother-in-law retrieved his keys from a pocket in his garish coat, Amber still firm in his grasp, and opened the house's ornate wooden door. Naser entered first, with Lucy's husband in tow carrying against his chest the sleeping light of his soul. They walked through the quiet house which awaited patiently the many future memories that would fill its walls, and soon came to the bedroom, its king-sized bed situated next to a crib which Amber's parents had picked out for her months before. \n\n\tLucy's sleeping form was placed gingerly down against the soft mattress, and her husband situated her head carefully on one of the bed's large pillows. With surgical precision, Naser lowered Amber into the crib and let go of her only when he was absolutely certain she was secure. He sighed long and deep as he rose back up, clearly having devoted great care into making sure the baby had been safe under his supervision. Scanning the room, his eyes happened upon an empty photo frame situated on top of a cabinet with imprinted text that read \"I LOVE MOMMY\". He scrutinized the object for several seconds before he was confident enough that its dimensions matched the ones of the picture which his mother had taken the previous night and had sent him to get printed, and which remained tucked away within his back pocket. He retrieved the photograph of his sister smiling for the camera and holding her newborn close, and carefully opened the frame to place it inside. It was a perfect fit. His brother-in-law glanced at him quizzically in an attempt to ascertain what he was doing, but his expression transitioned to one of happy approval when Naser gestured to the newly filled frame, now containing the first picture of Amber to grace the house.\n\n\tNaser's brother-in-law followed him on his way down the hallway and out the door, and he thanked him profusely for his help, which Naser humbly downplayed in his characteristic manner. They had hugged tightly for a long moment there in the doorway before Naser set off, making clear before his departure that he would always be there to help with anything they required. Just has he returned to the bedroom, Amber had awakened, and she began to wail loudly. Lucy had stirred, and a single citrine eye half-opened looked towards the crib where her daughter lay in distress. \n\n\tHer husband collapsed into bed next to his wife, the shrill sound of the infant's crying doing nothing to darken his mood. He stared wordlessly at the woman beside him, enamored with the mere fact of her presence. Eventually her gentle voice rose above the persistent cries of her daughter.\n\n\t\"I need to sing Amber a lullaby.\"\n\n\t\"Fang,\" he started, \"You're exhausted, you can't-\"\n\n\tLucy shot him a fierce and all too familiar scowl that cut his protests off without a word.\n\n\t\"She's my baby girl, I gave birth to her, and I'll sing her a damn lullaby if I want to,\" she snapped. To that declaration he could offer no resistance, and he watched as she raised herself from the bed and crept over to the crib containing their weeping daughter, rocking it ever so gently, spinning the mobile above that hung suspended. Her melodious dulcet tones washed over the room as she serenaded the girl, whose wails slowly faded in volume until they had devolved into soft whines and eventually the melody that Lucy crooned was the room's only sound. Her voice truly was hypnotic, and even her husband soon found his eyes growing heavy from the lullaby. \n\n\tWhen Amber had finally fallen back into the dreaming realm, her mother bent down closer into the crib and whispered, \"God bless, darling.\"\n\n\tWhile her husband had expected her to return to the bed directly after she had finished pacifying their daughter, she instead took a small detour, making way to the far corner of room and stopping when she had reached her guitar which rested there. Bending down slightly and exerting herself for a moment, she lifted the instrument and carried it back to the bed where her husband was waiting, reassuming her position on the mattress next to him.\n\n\tHolding the guitar in the reflexive manner with which she always had while playing, her clawed finger gently strummed its finely-tuned strings a few times to the audience of her curious spouse. Then his curiosity gave way to a profound sentimentality as she began to play the instrument proper, and he recognized the song instantly. Their song. The song they had composed and written together all those years ago which Lucy could still recall by heart. He closed his eyes and allowed her to play uninterrupted, immersing himself in the music, until the melodious vibrations finally ceased and he heard the sound of the guitar being placed down beside the bed. \n\n\tOpening his eyes, he gazed upon the love of his life, whose eyes were a glittering orange ocean in which he was content to forever swim. She was the shining star which lit his whole world, and she was here, with him, alive and safe and happy and close.\n\n\t\"I'm so lucky to have you,\" he said.\n\n\tLucy hummed softly as her eyes grew lidded and her cheeks grew a gentle pink. \"Glad to hear that, because you're stuck with me, dweeb,\" she smirked. \n\n\tAnd she kissed him on the lips deeply with her long snout, before drawing near to him and taking hold of his torso with her feathery arms as her wings encircled him. Her touch alone instantly dissipated any and all visions of the miserable futures which might have befallen him without her. Their home was alight with radiance and life, a canvas ready to receive all the shared joy between their family which was to be. \n\n\tLucy snuggled against her lover and closed her eyes, relaxing into him as she at last allowed herself to rest from the physical and spiritual toll that the past twenty-four hours had taken on her, and her husband soon felt her body relax and her breathing become easy and even. He wrapped his arms protectively around his wife and kissed her forehead gently before following her into the most peaceful sleep either of them had ever had. His beloved and his baby girl would be there when he woke up, and they would be there every day for many, many happy years to come.\n\n\t-------THE END-------","Title":"Welcomings","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Amber, Naser, Ripley, Samantha, Trish, Reed, Naomi","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"You Raised Her Well.txt":{"path":["Anon","You Raised Her Well.txt"],"text":"Title: You Raised Her Well\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Amber, Naser, Ripley and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n>Given the day's occasion, you couldn't help but look back at the pictures your daughter took on prom night with the young man she's been with ever since.\n>His size and brawn almost reminded you of Spears. He even had that look of calm intelligence duelling explosive fury, albeit still nascent. And Lucy in her mother's dress, the night as a whole, was a bittersweet memory.\n>Grug didn't make you feel like you had to pull pages from Ripley's playbook to keep him in line. Polite, respectful, sharp, and so sweet on your daughter that you could see the love between them from a mile off even then.\n>That's why news of him proposing after they both graduated college didn't shock you in the slightest. Your daughter was ecstatic, and you had to hold back the lone tear of pride that she was doing so well for herself after overcoming that transitionary phase of young adulthood, flourishing just as Fang, sweet Fang, did.\n>That's why you were sitting in the car outside the wedding venue, getting everything out now so you wouldn't ruin your little girl's special day.\n>You had already gone over all those pictures of Fang even before Lucy was just a twinkle in your eye. You would have given Grug your old tuxedo but retailoring it wouldn't taken too much, so now those wine-stained sleeves were coated over in drying tears. \n>Tears of sorrow when you went over the part of the book where Fang dropped off and Lucy picked up. The only pictures you had of the funeral were in your head, and even those were almost too much to bear.\n>But even why you wept changed as you watched all of those birthday photos and life's firsts start to roll in. Her first steps, her first violin, bass, and guitar, the first time she stepped out of your hands and into school. All those pictures with grandma and grandpa. Raptor Jesus bless Ripley and Sam.\n>Highschool, prom, and then the pictures she had mailed you from college. And now that blank page that was going to be filled with wedding photos.\n>You wish she could be here to have seen all of that. To see this.\n>Later on the ceremony starts up and you walk her down the isle, keeping it all together for her when you see her in her mother's old dress, wearing that amulet of amber.\n>You're strong for her when you think it's time to step away, one last time, for her to be wed to her man.\n>And you almost falter when Naser, somehow looking barely aged, taps you on the shoulder and hands forward a guitar. \n>Her guitar\n>Lucy turns to you and gives a smile that tells you this was her idea.\n>\"Dad, before we start, could you play something for us? I know she would want you to.\"\n>You almost break down but smile through the freshly welling tears as you take it and place the strap over your neck.\n>There's no question on what to play.\n>It's her song. It's the one she guided your hands on and wrote out in her head, passing it on to you. It's what you would play whenever Lucy couldn't sleep as a child and needed something to her lull her to sleep, and what you would sit and play when it felt like you couldn't go on any further.\n>You can only shut your eyes and go through it all. The dam breaks and you swear for one last time you can feel her hands guiding your's again.\n>All of it comes tumbling down as you finish the song off, all that's left to do is fling your arms around your daughter a final time, tell her how much you love her, how much her mother would've loved her, and step away after she squeezes you tight and lets go.\n>A few hours later while she and Grug are entertaining guests you can't help but sit off to the side, trying to recompose yourself.\n>You're so wrapped up in thought that you hardly notice when your side of the bench practically raises and a meaty, claw-tipped hand settles on your shoulder.\n>You swear this is the only time Ripley has done this without meaning for it to hurt.\n>He's still a grizzled stone of a pteropatriarch, somehow keeping muscle and an imposing stature on into old age. But there are some warn-out features to match; a milky eye and a few missing teeth. There's a fatigue behind the one he can still see out of that took up lodging when Samantha died and never left.\n>Everything passes for a while before he speaks.\n>\"I wanted to tell you something, before we both go off and probably drink ourselves blind. You did it, son. You're one of the biggest reasons why my granddaughter is getting the happiest day of her life. You succeeded as a man and, more importantly as, a father. You didn't break even when it felt like everything was falling apart, and you did what a father is supposed to do. You kept everything together even in the face of total despair, all for her. You're a man I'm proud to call my son, and you can golf with me anytime.\"\n>You can only inhale deeply and say thank you before you get one of the ptero's rare pats on the back along with a smile as he gets up.\n>He was right.

I\u2019ve come here every day since learning the truth, that Fang was alive, and each day my bank account dwindles down a little more. I haven\u2019t even considered getting a job: Nothing can interrupt what I\u2019m doing on these days. Eventually though, I\u2019ll have to move out of my apartment in Skin Row. I clutch that a little tighter, shaking my head to banish those thoughts. I\u2019ve still got some things to pawn before that day comes.\nThe room is brightly lit, the large windows on this side of the building letting in plenty of morning light, not at all what I would expect from a mental health ward. Fang sits upright in her bed, staring away from me. She seems to like staring out that window: Except for my daily visits, it\u2019s the only contact she has with the outside world.\nWell, the only contact she could have.\nSmiling, I announce my presence as I walk over to her, just as I was told to do. \u201cH-hey, Sugar Lips. It\u2019s me, Anon.\u201d I know better than to get any closer, not needing to look down to see the taped barricade placed around Fang\u2019s bed by the orderlies. Fang gives an involuntary twitch as my voice brings her out of her reverie, turning her head to gaze somewhat in my direction. Her eyes, once the brightest amber, have dulled, her glassy orbs failing to track me as I quickly take my usual seat by her side.

I think she hoped I would be able to life Fang out of whatever spell she had been under since that day. \nI hoped so too. I\u2019ve played at Fang\u2019s bedside every day since learning she was in the hospital, each time getting just a little bit better. Fang would be so proud of how I\u2019ve improved, probably calling me a dweeb for spending this much time on something.\nBrushing the tears from my eyes, I sit quietly, hands resuming their practiced position over the guitar. It hasn\u2019t been easy, trying to remember perfect that song she played for me in her bedroom, but I think I\u2019ve just about got it now. Often, I would stay up so late trying to remember how that song went, that the only sleep I got would be on the public bus to the penitentiary hospital and back. \nBut all those sleepless nights were about to be worth it.\nTapping my foot in a mimicry of how Fang\u2019s tail use to beat out rhythm, I set to playing our song, hers song. Glancing up from the strings, I can see Fang\u2019s eyes slowly track my fingers as the crawl along the neck. Music seemed to soothe her, seemed to bring some part of her back to me, each time I played. In the beginning, I had tried talking to her, tried to explain where she was, but I knew now to let the music do the talking for me.\nThis morning is going exceptionally well: I haven\u2019t hit a foul note yet, and Fang seems lucid enough that we may get through this without a screaming episode. Smiling at Fang, I drop my gaze back to my fingering once more, giving the guitar my total focus. I can feel the tears start to roll down my cheeks now, squeezing out past my tightly closed eyelids. I\u2019m giving everything to this song now, my entire soul rolling out in the melodic harmonies and rifts that the only girl I\u2019ve ever loved \u2013 the only girl to love me back \u2013 had written, all those days ago.\nEventually, the song is done, the final notes echoing in the empty room, a concert for just the two of us.

Fang sat in her bathroom, staring at the tiny object in her hands. The cheap pink plastic threatened to crack under the pressure of her tightening grip. Two. There were two, right there, to be sure. She blinked, rubbing her eyes. Maybe it was an optical illusion. Maybe there was something in her eyes. It was three am, maybe her mind was playing tricks and there was really only one. Fang closed her eyes and took a few breaths. Maybe it was broken? But what were the odds two out of the same box would be busted? Fang reopened her eyes and was confronted with the harsh reality which she promptly rejected, sending the drug store pregnancy test shattering against the wall. She took out another one, followed the instructions, and waited patiently.\n\n\tTwo bars. \n        \n        She started to hyperventilate. Tears welled up, and then ran down her cheeks. She could almost feel the droplets hitting her shaking hands, and could almost see them hitting the shaking screen. It was hard to tell because at the moment, she couldn't feel or see much of anything anymore.\n\n        'Mom and Dad are gonna kill me.'\n---\n\n        \"Fang!\"\n\t\n        The sudden sound startled the ptero who glanced up and met the eyes of Trish.\nThe four of them - Fang, Trish, Reed, and Anon - were sitting down eating lunch at the school cafeteria. Reed had gotten up to get thirds, and Anon was busy as usual checking his phone.\n\n     \"What?\" asked Fang. \n\n     \"What do you mean, 'What'? You keep zoning out! You've barely even eaten! What's with you?\" Trish demanded. \"Are you even in any condition for our band practice?\" \n\n        Fang looked down at her half eaten pizza (which was cold and hard when she bought it), and the salad that she had been stabbing at for the last five minutes (could you blame her? the lettuce was all wilted). \"I'm just thinking about some stuff right now...\" Fang started cautiously. \"It's nothing, I'll be fine. Which song are we doing this time?\" She finished, putting on a smile to placate the Triceratops. Trish, thoroughly placated by the lie, went back to smiling and answered the question - and continued with whatever it was she was talking about before. Fang already zoned her out, not intent on actually listening. She had more important things to worry about. \n\t\n        Do I tell him? She wondered, throwing a sidelong glance at Anon. Her boyfriend. Her mate. The self-correction and implications of that word made her feel jittery inside. It was like a trillion little butterflies were flying around in her stomach and throat, threatening to trigger a gag reflex and make her spit out whatever small amount of the poor school lunch she had managed to actually get down. 'I should really tell him.' But how would she say it? 'Hey dweeb, you're gonna be a father.' No. 'You were right, we should've used a condom! Haha!' Fuck no. 'Hypothetically if you got me pregnant, you would still stay right?' Just stop.\n\t\n        Fang pushed the plate away from her, she lost her appetite. Inching closer to anon, she snuck a glance at his phone. She saw pages of text, some red and some green, and pictures she didn't recognize. Must be that forum he mutters about. 'He smells good today.' She breathes in his scent, his natural human smell mixing with whatever deodorant he used this time. It filled her head, and she lost herself in thought. Maybe this isn't so bad. She could stay like this forever, really. What was she worried about? It's obvious they'd be together forever. Her hand inched towards his, centimeter by centimeter. Almost there. Almost. Almost...\n\n        The alarm rings, back to class.\n---\n        Like everything else that day, class came and went. As did the next, and the next, and then Fang was home. She laid down on her bed, looking at the cheap, pink pregnancy test. She had kept it ever since then, though in the heat of the moment she had almost broke it like the one before. Two little bars, that's all it took to make a difference in her life. Two vertical lines, and her life would never be the same. Her grip tightened. As if she wasn't going through enough already, this had to happen. She was already stressed about the band, stressed about trish, stressed about her family. She really didn't need this too. A horrible thought dawned on her. 'It would be so easy...' She squeezed her eyes shut and briefly considered it, the trip to the clinic. The mental tangent playing out in her mind. Sitting down in the waiting room, maybe reading a magazine laying on the table. Trying not to make eye contact with any of the other expecting teenagers, soon to be expecting nothing but a bill for the service. She pictured the walking with the doctor. How easy it would be, to just... do that instead. Nobody would ever have to know. But she would know. Years later when she and anon were married, and they had a child for real, nobody but her and Raptor Jesus would know that the sweet little bundle of joy had once had a sibling.\n        \n        No. She couldn't do it. She pushed the thought violently out of her mind, ejecting it out of the airlock of thought and consideration. Fuck that. The shame and embarrassment would be bad enough, the doctors seeing her and knowing her and judging her. But even past that, she couldn't live with herself. Even if lately she had had doubts about the little wooden crucified raptor hanging around the house, she had it instilled in her that life was precious. She felt sick even considering it. It was Anon's kid too, he would have the right to know. She'd tell him, she promised herself. Eventually. She looked at the object in her hands once more before putting it back in her desk drawer for safekeeping; hidden amongst sheets of musical notes and songs meant for Wwurm Drama. She stroked her wings absentmindedly, a prelude to the terrible habit she'd been forming. It wasn't healthy to pluck and rip her feathers, but some days it was the only thing that let her feel anything but numbness anymore. It had been that way for months. Until Anon had come along. \n\n        He changed everything. \n\n        He was so cute, so handsome, so considerate. So quiet. Quiet when she talked, quiet during class, quiet when she and Trish and Reed would get into a squabble. He was a silent observer, and she liked that about him. Trish would always start something, poking and prodding and irritating until she got a reaction. Reed would talk nonsense, too high on drugs to care what jumbled mess came out of his mouth. Mom and Dad would talk, and talk, and talk. What's she doing? Why is she like this? Is it someone at school? They loved her so much, why does she treat them like this? Whinging and whining until she mentally tuned them out. But never Anon. She could listen to him speak forever. Anon would sit there and let her vent her frustrations, giving a hug or a nod of his head. If she was lucky, he'd even place his hand on hers. Why couldn't more people be like him? Fang sighed, dropping her hand. She let the handful of bloody feathers fall out of her grasp and onto the pile that had been forming at the side of her bed. She had gotten distracted and hadn't realized how much she had pulled. Geez, it looked like a crime scene in her. Mom and Dad would most definitely freak out if they saw. But then again, what don't they freak out about nowadays?","Title":"Another Fang","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Anonymous"},"Another Fang Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Fang","Another Fang Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Walking home after school, Fang was lost in thought. She'd been thinking about a lot of things lately. There were a few projects for her classes coming up, and Trish was talking about setting up a gig for the band soon. There was also the fact she now was carrying a life inside her. It had already been a few weeks, and she still hadn't said anything to Anon. Too afraid. It was stupid of course - how could he say anything but yes? They loved each other so much, it was obvious he'd take responsibility. But the negative little voice in her head whispered threats and promises that made it hard for her to accept the obvious truth. She could picture it now. He would be upset she didn't tell him. Upset at the responsibility she'd thrust upon him. It wasn't just her future being shaken, it was his too wasn't it? He never talked much about what he wanted to do after graduation, but whatever he wanted to do would now be drastically altered. He'd yell at her. Say horrible things. Leave. She'd be left standing there in the street, or his apartment, all alone to raise their child by herself. If her parents found out, WHEN they found out, her life was practically forfeit. The thought of the inevitable reckoning was enough to make her stomach sour and face burn. But! If he was there to support her, there was nothing they couldn't do together. No obstacle they couldn't overcome. \n\n                    But if he wasn't...\n\n        She refused to encourage any more of those thoughts, throwing them out of her head like she had done the thoughts of visiting the clinic. She was a woman on a mission - a mission to make it home in one piece. Normally she would have had Naser or Reed drive her home; but Reed was busy with Trish setting up preparations for their plan. She had had an argument with Naser this morning, and she didn't want to see him again for a while. So it came to pass that she had no options but to take the bus, or walk home. Picturing the trip on the community bus was enough to send a shiver down her spine, so she decided to walk instead. Most people would look down on walking whilst having one's eyes glued to a phone, but Fang wasn't most people. She walked briskly, thumb scrolling through webpages and media blog feeds almost in time with her quick pace. There were a few close calls with some idiot who didn't look where he was going, or some stupid rock laying haphazardly, but for the most part Fang kept the brisk walking uninterrupted. That is, until she had a thought. 'What about clothes?'\n\n        Not clothes for herself, that is. Fang had a vast closet filled to the brim with multiples of her favorite black halter top and ripped jeans. Instead, clothes for her  baby. She knew there would be plenty of time to think about this later, and that she should really go home and get to work on the assignments. Life didn't stop just because she got knocked up. It was an important moment, but the stresses of the day to day didn't falter in observance of a miracle. The more she thought, the more she knew she couldn't go home yet. Not now. Not gonna be satisfied until a look around has been made. And so it came to pass also that Fang found herself in the baby section of a clothes store. She uttered a quick prayer as she walked the aisles. That no one she knew would notice her. Or anyone in general, really. \n\n        The store, though small - and the infant isles even smaller - had a wide selection of garments. Hats, socks, pants, you name it. All in every color you could think of, all so tiny and cute Fang nearly squealed when she saw them. Gone was the stress of home, of school, of her band mates. All that remained was the unbridled joy of an expectant mother precisely in her element. Fang felt giddy, like she was a little girl again. Her excitement bubbled up inside of her like those old mentos-and-coke experiments from kindergarten. Butterflies were abound in her chest and stomach, her heart beating rapidly, her lungs struggling to keep up. It was overwhelming. She reached the pajama section, and for a brief second she wondered if she felt her heart stop, and her chest cave in on itself. Raptor Jesus, they were so fucking cute. Little one piece pajamas sat lined up on a table, barely bigger than the size of a hand. Two in particular caught her eye.  It was the same style, really, but different colors - a pink and a blue. 'Girl and Boy' she thought. The getup was textured and fuzzy, a line of buttons going up the front. Little booties for the little feet, a little hoodie for the little head. Adorable.\n\n        But which one to get? It was too early to tell if it - Fang stopped herself, and corrected. Person, not an object. It was too early to tell if *they* would be a boy or a girl. Or something else entirely, a thought announced. 'Maybe they'll be non-binary, like me.' It would be in poor taste to get some getup matching the reinforced archetypes and stereotypes of color and gender, wouldn't it? Pink isn't necessarily for girls anyways, who's stupid idea was that to begin with? All the lectures and tidbits Trish had thrown out over the past months and years surfaced. That's right, Fang thought. What was she doing? How could she be so careless? Thank you Trish. Despite all the times you act like a bitch, you're still the closest friend in the world. With a heavy heart, Fang puts the clothes back. She wants so desperately to buy one, to prove to herself that she can be a responsible parent. Being prepared ahead of time never hurt anyone, did it? She put the clothes back, saddened that she didn't get to act. Until her eyes caught it. The same clothes as before but in yellow; hidden under a pile of pink and blue imitations. Her hands dove under the pile, retrieving the tiny garments. Pale yellow, like a banana. Fang ran her thumb across the surface, feeling the handiwork and material.\n\n        Thoughts came and went. A tiny, pale pterosaur struggling to walk upright. Miniature wings unfurled behind them, trying to keep balance. Wisps of silver hair hiding the bright, amber eyes. The creature giggling as it stumbled around, trying to find a place the tiny hands could find purchase on.\nThe same baby laying in a crib, sucking on a thumb, a peaceful expression across the face. Sitting in a car seat, making happy noises as they looked out the windows of the vehicle, taking in the world as if it was the most beautiful thing ever.\n\n        Fang hadn't realized it, too busy daydreaming, but she had begun to rub her face up against the clothes. Feeling the softness. Breathing in the clean, washed scent. She took the smell in lungfuls, felt every individual bump and crease on her face. She was one with the pajamas.\n\n        \"That's so cute.\"\n        \n        The sudden voice snapped Fang out of her hallucination. She Her eyes opened, and saw an employee looking over at her. The woman had a basket in front of her, swapping out stock on the shelves for what was inside. Couldn't have been more than twenty five. The world stood still for a moment, and Fang cursed the prayer she had given. Should've known it wouldn't have worked.\n\n        \"I remember when I was like that. It's so exciting, isn't it? You just can't wait for them to be here already. It's scary at first, but it all has a habit of working out.\" The worker seemed lost in thought, her eyes glazing over as she remembered her own young love and young pregnancy. \"I can tell you'll make a great mother, I bet the father is so happy to have someone like you\"\n\n        \"It's not for me!\" Fang protested, suddenly defensive. She started to panic. \"It's for my... sister. Baby sister. I wanted to surprise my mom.\"\nDespite revoking her last prayer she silently screamed another one, begging that the worker took the bait. That she didn't press further. The lady apologized quickly, reversing herself on her faux pas in a hurry.\n\n        \"Oh my, I'm so sorry! That's so sweet of you though! I wish more older sisters did that for their siblings.\"\n     \n        Fang muttered an acceptance for the apology - although something about the way the lady said it felt off - and quickly excused herself from the situation. But the employee was insistent. Personally escorted to the checkout by the woman, Fang felt her face burn a little when one or two shoppers glanced her way. She hugged the clothes tightly against her, desperate for people to not notice what it was she was holding. After what felt like an eternity, the was handed the receipt and allowed to leave.\n\n         \"I'm sure your sibling will love it, dear. Take good care of them.\" The worker said in her off way of speaking, and as Fang turned to leave, she could swear she saw a wink.\n\n        Fang screamed internally as she pushed her way out of the shop and back on her walking route, bag in hand. She knows. She has to know. She might not ever see Fang again, she might not even remember the meeting in five minutes. Fang could've been nothing but another face to the worker, lost in the sea of visages that passed through the store on an hourly basis. But for Fang, it was the fact of the matter. The principle of the thing. Someone saw her and put two and two together. Someone, for even the briefest of seconds, knew her secret. Hours later as Fang collapsed on her bed after making it home, she knew in her heart of hearts that the encounter would mean she wouldn't be getting any sleep tonight. After tossing and turning for a bit, Fang got up and retrieved the test she had saved from her desk drawer and looked at it. When she looked at the lines, all she could see was a bright future with Anon. No worries, they would be carefree. They'd find a way. Love always found a way, didn't it? Sure, she was stressed now. So stressed that some days she could feel the bile bubble up in her throat, and her stomach trying it's damnedest to knot itself into oblivion. She was stressed beyond belief, her patchy wings testament to truth. But as always, whenever she started to sink down into the depths of despair, the image of her child returned to her mind. The image of THEIR child, her and Anon. The child they made together, the child they would raise together.\n\n        \"It's all worth it for you.\" She said aloud, hoping the baby inside could hear."},"Days Of Estrus Week.txt":{"path":["Fang","Days Of Estrus Week.txt"],"text":"Title: Days Of Estrus Week\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Ripley, Samantha and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n>day one\n>fang is mostly ok\n>just likes to cuddle and hold hands\n>day two\n>still ok\n>her hands are starting to wander when she holds anon\n>day three\n>getting hot and bothered with labored breathing as soon as she sees anon\n>day four\n>can't take her hands off of anon, just kissing and groping though\n>day five\n>can barely restrain herself from ripping her clothes off when anon comes over\n>day six\n>ripley get called to the station because dozens of male dinos were arrested for vandalism\n>fang locks the door to her room as soon as anon enters\n>she's naked\n>day seven\n>Anon is in the hospital\n>lacerations all over his back, dehydration, exhaustion, severe bruises on his pelvis and hips, acute shit-eating grin\n>a mortified Fang, a pissed of Ridley, and a proud Samantha talking to the doctor\n>Fang sees a nurse replacing anons IV drip\n>\"yes, another toast to ptero pu-\" as he passes out again, the wide grin still plastered on his face","Title":"Days Of Estrus Week","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Ripley, Samantha and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Dirty Laundry.txt":{"path":["Fang","Dirty Laundry.txt"],"text":"Title: Dirty Laundry\nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Fang, Trish, Reed, Spears and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Rc-05\nSummary: Anon gets his \"dirty laundry\" shown off, things get dark.

WAIT *pant* A *pant* MINUTE *pant* GODDAMNIT!\"\n\nHe doesn't respond to my pleads and simply runs towards the street\u2026 I couldn't\ncatch up with him.\nFuck! Where does he live?! I can't even go to his house!\nAaargh I should have asked for his address, goddamnit.\n\nI return back to where I came from, where I can see Reed waiting near the\nprincipal's office door.\n\n\"Hey Reed. Why are you waiting here?\"\n\n\"Hey Fang, the principal got a hold of Trish and he's scolding her.\"\n\n\"Oh really?\"\n\nThen Trish comes out of the door, sobbing like a little bitch.\nI do not know what even should I say about this whole situation I mean\u2026 She\njust doxed my new friend in front of dozens of students and she's acting like\nshe's the victim here.\n\n\"Why\u2026 did you do this\u2026? Was this really fucking necessary?\"\n\n\"I'm- *sniff* s-sorry\u2026\"\n\nI get even more pissed at her: \"Oh? You are sorry? YOU ARE SORRY? WHAT THE FUCK\nIS WRONG WITH YOU?

SPEAK UP!\"\n\nShe explodes: \"I WAS SCARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU AWAY FROM OUR BAND!\nOUR FRIENDSHIP!

He\nhasn't once told us about where he came from, what he actually does, NOTHING!\nCan you even consider him as a friend?\"\n\nWhat the hell?\nThen Reed spoke with a unusually disappointed and righteous tone.\n\n\"Trish, that was, like, uncalled for. He's not a bad person: I just think that\nhe doesn't want to stand out. But still, what you did is wrong. You should\nreally apologize to him.\"\n\nShe didn't answer at all, keeping her head low.\n\n\"I'm going to leave the band for a while\u2026 I need some time for myself.\"\n\nTrish looked at me with even more watered eyes, as her world shattered\ncompletely.\n\nHe looked at me with sorrow and a sad look on his face: none of us could have \nbelieved what just happended today.\n\nThe day goes by and the only thing that I can think of is Anon. I hope that it\ndidn't damage him that much\u2026 I send a message afterwards to see if he's alright.\n\nFANG: Hey are you ok dude?\n\nAfter an hour and half I didn't get neither a \"read\" notification or any kind of\nresponse. God I'm getting worried about him: I hope to see him tomorrow so I can\nrepay the favor that he gave to me.\n\n## The next day... ##\n\nSo far I've been nervous for the entire way up to school and when I arrive at\nthe Volcano High entrance I do not see Anon anywhere.\nIt's understandable, given yesterday's events. But I can't shake the feeling\nthat something really bad is going to happen\u2026\n\nPrincipal Spears appears in front of me and asks me to follow him in his office.\nMaybe it's about Anon?\n\n\"I'm glad that you followed me in my office, Fang.\"\n\n\"No problem sir. So you wanted to talk about Anon, right?\"\n\n\"Pretty sharp, if I say so myself. Yes, that's right. I've tried to call Anon's\nparents but they do not seem to care about their son that much considering that\nthey seemed unfazed by what I've told about them. So I was thinking: why don't\nyou go check up on him?\"\n\n\"Me? Really? I mean sure I can go. But I do not know where he lives.\"\n\nHe gave me his address, then he put his oversized hand on my shoulder and with\na sort of \"parental\" but earnest look said\n\n\"I have great hope in you for putting Anon back to his feet. You may go now.\"\n\n\"Yes, thanks Mr.Spears\"\n\nI got out from there and now I have the responsibility of putting Anon back on\ntrack. Ugh I'm getting scared\u2026 Am I even capable of doing something like this?\nDeep down I know that Anon needs my help: he helped me on the top of the roof\nso I want to repay the favor.\n\n\"Hey Fang, have you heard of Anon?\"\n\nReed pops out of nowhere with his usual care-free tone.\n\n\"Hey Reed. No, sadly he didn't respond, but the principal asked me to go to his\nhouse to check up on him. He gave me Anon's address.\"\n\n\"Cool! So where does he live? We can, like, go check up on him together if you\nwant.\"\n\nI hesitantly respond \"He lives in Skin Row.\"\n\n\"Oh\u2026 That's gonna be a little problem\u2026 But oh well, if we are together it will\nbe safer.\"\n\nReed's not wrong. Skin Row is regarded as one of the worst zones of Volcadera\nwhere usually junkies and\/or other humans live. I'm a little worried to be\nhonest\u2026 For the sake of Anon I will go there but I first want to speak to Anon\nalone, maybe he feels more comfortable if I am the only one there.\"\n\n\"Reed, thank you but I think that Anon will only speak up to me, at least for\nnow. Please!\"\n\nReed looks at me with a sad look but agrees.\n\"Ok then\u2026 Let me know how it went: if you need my help, you can, like, call me.\"\n\n\"Sure. I'll call you later.\"\n\nSo I decide to check on Anon after the classes, get the bus and see if he's\nalright.\n\n*So this is where he lives\u2026 No wonder he's on welfare* I think to myself.\n\nI knock on the door, no response whatsoever.\nI retry knocking on the door, and again I do not get a response,\nAfter insisting I saw the door open only to be presented with a very pale Anon\nand bags under his eyes.\n\n\"Jesus you look like shit.\"\n\n\"Did you come here just to shit on me like everyone else? Then fuck off.\"\n\n\"No Anon wait! I came here to check up on you!\" He looked at me with a\ndumbfolded expression before registering what I just said.\n\n\"... Come inside then. Welcome to \u2018La casa del Shithole!\u2019\"\n\nHe closes the door behind me and I sit on the floor while he just throws himself\non the bed with an empty look on his eyes.\n\n\"Anon\u2026 I'm sorry that this happened to you I mean- I never thought that her of\nall people would pull a stunt like that.\"\n\nHe suddently flinches and snaps at me, surprising me with a very unnatural\nangry tone and open wide eyes\n\n\"OH REALLY? WHO DO YOU THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN HUH? SHE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT\nCOULD HAVE PULLED A DICK MOVE LIKE THAT!\"\n\nThe usually calm and composed Anon that I knew transformed in a rage-filled,\nmaniac looking one which really scared me as it was something that I've never\nbelieved could come out from someone like him.\n\n\"Anon please, just calm down. I came here to speak to you\u2026 I'm sorry that Trish\npulled a stunt like that! I never though that she would do something like-\"\n\n\"IT DOESN'T MATTER! NOW EVERYONE IS JUST THROWING SHIT AT ME! I NEVER WANTED\nTHIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN!\"\n\nSo I was right that he changed schools for this. Sure the fact that he posed like\nthat in these pictures was cringy but still\u2026\n\n\"I did whatever I could to remain as anonymous as possible! I didn't do anything\nto piss someone off and what do I get?!?! I GET RIDICULED IN FRONT OF ALL THE\nFUCKING STUDENTS! AND IT'S ALL THAT PURPLE BITCH'S FAULT! I-\"\n\nBefore he could finish I approached him and put his head on my chest to make him\ncalm down.\n\n\"Look Anon. I know that you are having it rough, I understand your pain. You\nhelped me on the top of the roof when I felt distressed about my identity, my\nproblems\u2026 Now I want to repay the favor by helping you. You need support right\nnow and I'm here for that.\" I said this in the hope of calming him down\u2026 But it\ndidn't work: instead he steadily jumps out of the bed and backs off from me,\nshouting like a madman.\n\n\"NO YOU DON'T GET IT! I TRIED EVERYTHING TO BE A SHADOW, TO NOT BE NOTICED BY\nANYONE AND YET\u2026and yet\u2026 I find you three, especially your schizo friend who\nhated me for no good reason\u2026\"\n\nHe collapses on his knees and as I slowly approach him\u2026\n\n\"I just\u2026 Leave me alone please\u2026 I don't want to speak to anyone right now.\"\n\nDevastated and without anything worth to say to him, I simply leave, closing\nthe door, hearing him sob and in fetal position on the floor.\n\nI just wanted to help him\u2026 And yet, I didn't manage to do a single fucking\nthing. I'm so goddamn useless\u2026 But as I went home I could not shake the feeling\nthat something terrible was going to happen.

Naomi, your roommate, promised to let the two of you have your fun alone that night; she had a date herself, after all, and her girlfriend wasn't one to wait up for her.\n\nEventually, you'd get curious, pressuring her to let you see her own place; it wasn't anything special, rather it was quite the opposite. A simple apartment, just barely large enough to fit enough furnishing for one person to live somewhat comfortably.\n\nShe would sob at the notion of moving in with you, tears of joy streaking down her face as she envelops you in the fluffiest hug you'd ever experience, though it would be she who would pop the big question in the end.\n\n'Do you love me, Anon?' She'd ask one night, while you two gazed up at the stars from the rooftop of the apartment building, and you'd realize that yes, you DO love her, more than anything in the world as you pull her closer, and whisper that one, almighty word. 'Yes.'\n\nThe next few days are a blur; things picking up speed not long after the two of you officiated your relationship status with each other.\n\nSoon, though, it comes time to meet her parents. You hadn't really heard much about them from Lucy herself, only that her dad had a tendency to be a bit of a hardass, with her mother being the one who ultimately wore the pants in the relationship. In her own words, 'They'd put you through the wringer for a bit, but they should warm up to you pretty quickly.'\n\nTheir house stands in stark contrast to the dingy apartment Lucy had been living in prior to her moving in with you; it wasn't quite McMansion territory, but it managed to straddle the line between tastefully spacious and extraordinarily gaudy. You remembered asking Lucy why she didn't just ask her parents for help finding a home, to which she sheepishly replied that she 'wanted to prove that she could handle herself well enough'.\n\nDinner went well, surprisingly. Her father, true to Lucy's word, raked you over the coals for a bit; questions about your job, your habits, your friends (ha) bombarded you for the first hour or so, only appearing to be satisfied once you mentioned that Lucy had moved in with you at your request. \n\nThe dinner ended with, among other things, a firm handshake from her father and a decidedly fluffy hug from her mother. That didn't mean that your night was over, of course, with Lucy nuzzling her snoot against your neck as you both climbed into the car, her hand incomspicuously drifting down into your pants as the engine roared to life.\n\nNeither of you got much sleep that night.\n\nThere was a certain phrase your father kept using, one that never really left you. 'Stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea', or something like that. As far as you both could tell, it was just an elaborate way to say 'Damned if you do, damned if you don't.'\n\nHere, though, as you held that small velvet box in the palm of your hand, you really couldn't think of any better way to describe how you felt. It wasn't that you didn't love Lucy, oh no, not at all. Rather, it was the anticipation, the fear of what might come next.\n\nYou both had a dinner date at a fairly fancy restaurant that night, one where you had initially planned on popping that all-important question to the woman who would be the love of your life, and yet as you sat there in your car you could only feel... doubt.\n\nYou knew she loved you. That wasn't even a question. But what weighed most on your mind was that traitorous idea that maybe, just maybe, she saw you as nothing more than a free ride, a way out of her own admittedly-miserable lifestyle for no more than the occasional night of passionate lovemaking.\n\nAnd you hated yourself for it, for even daring to think that such a thing could possibly be true, that there was even the slightest chance that she was using you.\n\nSteeling yourself, you walked into the restaurant; Lucy had already been seated, a look of mock anger in her eye as she playfully admonished you for being late, the waiter coming over shortly afterwards to hand out the drink menus.\n\nTaking a brief moment to reflect, you consider just how far the two of you have come together; you've both come a long, long way since you first met, and that gives you an idea.\n\nAs soon as the check comes, you ask Lucy to come with you, to just take a walk around town.\n\nYou stop in front of the alleyway where the two of you first met; it takes her a moment to recognize what this place is, enough time for you to slip the box out of your jacket pocket, and get down on one knee...\n\nShe said yes.\n\nIt's been a few months since you married Lucy, since you swept her off her feet in the chapel and carried her to the limo waiting outside to take the two of you home.\n\nSince then, she's quit her job at the Shop'n'Save, making a fairly decent living as she taught music theory at the high school you both went through; after all, with a kid on the way it wouldn't do to have her be working a stressful job of any sorts.\n\nYou, meanwhile, became the school counselor; you'd both figured that it'd be the best place for you in town. Of course, being closer to your wonderfully fluffy wife might've had something to do with it.\n\nNaomi, meanwhile, got engaged to her soon-to-be wife; Lucy couldn't hold back her smile when she saw Trish walking down the aisle, the Triceratops practically beaming with joy as she said her vows.\n\nNow you lay here, on the rooftop of Volcano High; your hand draped over the pregnant swell of Lucy's belly as she nuzzled her snoot into your shoulder, the afterglow of the past half-hour just barely having faded as the setting sun sets the sky ablaze. For a brief moment, you feel a withering dread for what the future might hold; all it takes is Lucy squeezing your hand tightly to banish those treacherous thoughts, dread finding itself replaced with nothing more than sheer anticipation.\n\nSometimes, everything turns out okay. And even if it didn't, even if you found yourself stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea...\n\nAs long as you had Lucy, you were ready for anything.","Title":"Doomer Lucy","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Ending 0.5 - Betrayal.txt":{"path":["Fang","Ending 0.5 - Betrayal.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending 0.5 - Betrayal\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Naomi, Naser and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nLeaving Naomi in the kitchen, I go back out and rejoin Lucy and the others getting ready to head over to Prom. Lucy\u2019s mom has finally managed to get Naser and Lucy together for some pictures; Naser\u2019s white blazer and sunglasses making him look like something out of Swamp City in Stone Theft Auto III, Lucy\u2019s radiant white dress making her eyes shimmer like jewels. She catches me staring and sticks her tongue out at me with a smile, ruining the picture that her mom was just about to take. Fang\u2019s dad is not amused, cracking his knuckles ominously. Gulping hard, I go take Lucy\u2019s hand to escort to the door, Naomi following suit as she wraps herself around Nasar\u2019s arm. With a quick promise to have fun and to be back by midnight, the four of us set off for Volcano High.\nTraffic this time of night is good, and we arrive in the parking lot only a few minutes later. There\u2019s a steady stream of students making their way to the gymnasium, couples holding each other\u2019s hand in nervous anticipation. Naser and Naomi head right off, joining another group of friends as the chat excitedly about the dance. Lucy and I hold back, Lucy nervously fidgeting with the flower and I plucked for her. I move to take her hands in mind, holding them in front of her chest as we stand face-to-face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Lucy, let\u2019s just have fun tonight!\u201d I try my best to assure her nothing will go wrong, that tonight will be totally safe. Lucy gives me a weak smile, moving her head to my chest as she hugs me tightly.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m just worried about seeing Naomi and Reed again. The way things ended with the band, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready just yet\u2026\u201d I can feel the tension in her body as I hold her tight against my chest, kissing the top of her head lightly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sugar Lips,\u201d I mumble into her hair, smiling as she pokes me in the ribs in retaliation for her pet name. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure nothing like that happens.\u201d Shifting slightly to place her hands on my chest, Lucy stares up at me, smiling, her amber eyes trusting every word I say.\n\u201cOkay, Anon.\u201d\nThe dance music assaults our ears the moment I open the door for Lucy. Students are milling about the dance floor, some dancing, others just chatting over their plates of hors d\u2019ordeves. Scanning the crowd quickly, I spot Trish and Reed over in the corner, the little trigger dejectedly picking at her plate as Reed is inhaling\u2026something. Making sure to keep myself between them and Lucy, I steer her over to the food table, where Naomi and Naser are waiting.\n\u201cThere you two are! Oh. My. GOSH! Isn\u2019t this just the greatest prom EVER?!\u201d Naomi\u2019s exultations nearly split my ears, and a likewise wince from Lucy prompts Naser to step in. \n\u201cHey, Babe, didn\u2019t we have that thing to finish up for the prom committee?\u201d Naser wraps his arm around the still-gushing Naomi, steering her off in the direction of the stage. With a final glance over her shoulder at us, Naomi slips her arms around Naser\u2019s once more, the two of them disappearing in to the crowd. \n\u201cUgh, thank god that bitch is gone. I still don\u2019t know what Naser sees in her, ya\u2019know?\u201d Lucy has returned from her scavenging mission, handing me a plate piled high of food, plucking a dino-nuggie from her own and swallowing it in one bite. She fixes me with a smile before setting her plate down on a nearby chair. \u201cCome on Anon, I wanna dance with you!\u201d Before I can protest that I\u2019ve hardly had anything to eat, Lucy drags me out onto the dance floor, finding a small opening for us away from the other students. An upbeat pop number is playing now: Definitely not Lucy\u2019s type of music, but she pistons my arms in time to the beat anyway, popping along to the music. Before long I\u2019m right there with her, displaying the best moves I\u2019ve got. The Sprinkler was a huge hit, forcing Lucy to cover her mouth to keep from laughing, and she even joined in on the Q-Tip during the second song. As the third song, a more heavy pop-rock piece, fades, we\u2019re both sweating underneath the flashing lights of the dance floor, having the time of our lives.\nSmiling, Lucy wraps her arms around me, head leaning on my chest, still humming the words to the last song softly under her breath. No other song has risen to replace the last one, and as Principal Spears mounts the stage, it must be time for the prom royalty announcement.\n\u201cAre we all having a good time?!\u201d For once, Spears\u2019 roar matches the atmosphere of the room as hundreds of students shout their assent back at him. Lucy even gives a sharp whistle as the monolithic man waves his hands for silence once more. \u201cYou\u2019ve partied hard Volcano High, but now it\u2019s time to meeeeeeeeeeet your. Prom. ROYALTY!\u201d Cheers erupt from the crowd, overriding the boos from Lucy as she protests this outdated and sexist tradition. I stay quiet, my eyes locked onto the stage.\n\u201cNow, without further delay, your winners are\u2026\u201d Spears reaches into his breast pocket, ripping open the garish envelope displaying the school colors. Unfolding the small paper within, the Principal adjusts his glasses for dramatic effect, before bellowing: \u201cNAOMI AND NAAAAAAAASER!\u201d\nCheers erupt once more from the assembled student body, barely covering an excited shriek from Naomi. As the couple mounts the stage, I clap along with the other students, eliciting a questioning look from Lucy as she\u2019s shifted suddenly from my chest.\n\u201cAnon, what the hell are you doing?!\u201d Lucy asks, crossing her arms and glaring up at me. I say nothing in response, simply nodding my head up to the stage where Naomi is quickly adjusting the microphone stand.\n\u201cIs this thing on? Okay. THANK YOU VOLCANO HIGH!\u201d More cheers erupt from the crowd, and I add my own to the mix this time. Lucy\u2019s eyes are flickering back and forth between the couple on stage and me, confusion spreading across her face. \u201cNaser and I are SOOOOO happy to be your Prom Royalty this year! We would like to thank alllllllll the organizers who made this event possible!\u201d \nAnother pause for cheers. I\u2019m staring at Naomi now, a broad smile on my face. Glancing out of the corner of my eye, I can see Lucy staring fully at me now, utterly bewildered. Her mouth works silently for words as Naomi\u2019s thanks prattle on.\n\u201cFinally, I\u2019ve got one special thank you to give out. Where\u2019s Anon? Anon? Oh! There, there you are! Wave to everyone Anon!\u201d A spotlight is turned on me as I wave eagerly to the assembled crowd. Distant shouts of \u201cweeb!\u201d and \u201closer!\u201d can be heard from the crowd, but I pay them little attention as I slowly turn to face Lucy. My date\u2019s eyes plead me for some explanation as she takes a half-step back from me, the hard light of the spotlight reflecting off her perfect white dress.\n\u201cWithout Anon, none of this would\u2019ve been possible. Without Anon, Naser\u2019s bitch of a sister would\u2019ve still been in our way, messing things up like always. Is that \u201cFang\u201d standing next to you, Anon? Good, she needs to hear this too.\u201d Naomi\u2019s air-quotes around Lucy\u2019s other name seem to bite into her, causing her to flinch at the sound. She still hasn\u2019t taken her eyes off of me.\n\u201cDid you really think Anon liked you, \u201cFang\u201d? Maybe even loved you? Ha! No one could love a loser like you, \u201cFang\u201d! I needed someone to get you out of Naser\u2019s hair, and Anon volunteered for us just after your little concert on his first day!\u201d Up on stage, Naser\u2019s face is split in an evil grin, matching my own as she too stares at his sister. All eyes are on the two of us now, the crowd going silent as our plan is read out-loud. Tears are brimming in Lucy\u2019s eyes now, and quiet whispers of \u201cno\u201d can be heard underneath Naomi\u2019s taunts and jeers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right \u201cFang\u201d! You\u2019re such a loser, we needed the new kid to pretend to be your friend! Isn\u2019t that hilarious, everyone? She\u2019s such a loser, no one in the school who knew you could even pretend to like you! Hahahaha!\u201d \nNaomi\u2019s shrill laughter is quickly joined by others from the assembled students, and before long the air is filled with the jeers and cackles of the assembled students, all directed at Lucy. I alone remain quiet among the students on the dance floor, my grin never faltering as I watch Lucy\u2019s face become more and more distraught, the river of tears spilling across her face leaving back rivulets of mascara as she continues to stare at me. She\u2019s no longer whispering under her breath, but her hands have found their way to her wings, a cascade of bloody feathers falling around her as she begins to preen. Lucy moves to take a half-step back towards me by instinct, desperately seeking the one source of comfort she had found in these last few weeks.\nI take a step back from her. \nLucy stopped suddenly, her eyes no longer seeing me, seeing anything. Her hands worked methodically, pulling fistfuls of feathers out as she sank to her knees, still staring off into space as the crowd\u2019s laughter echoed through the gymnasium. Unable to hold it in any longer, I join the rest of the students, pointing at Lucy and laughing until I can barely stand up straight. All the while Lucy just sat there, staring at nothing, tears flowing from her eyes even as her now-bloody hands tore into her wings. \nMy last words to her were \u201cwho could ever love someone like you?\u201d","Title":"Ending 0.5 - Betrayal","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Naomi, Naser and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Ending 1 - Fang's Got a Gun.txt":{"path":["Fang","Ending 1 - Fang's Got a Gun.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending 1 - Fang's Got a Gun\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Naser and Naomi\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nEnding 1 - Fang's got a gun\n\nFang\u2019s bootsteps rang heavy in the empty halls of Volcano High, her slow, steady footfalls beating out the final tempo she would ever hear. It was well into second period now, but she kept a sharp lookout for any other classmates who may be roaming the halls. If anyone spotted her, if anyone she knew called out to her, she may not be able to do what she had to do, may not be able to wake up from her nightmare of a life.\nShe wondered what Anon was doing right now. Last night with Anon had been\u2026nice, a wonderful oasis in the lifeless desert that had become her life. But she knew it couldn\u2019t last, she knew it for what it was; a mirage, a mirage conjured up by Naomi to drive her away, to smother her. Fang snarled wordlessly at the thought of Naomi, hands clenching hard enough to draw blood. \nBut that didn\u2019t change the fact that it HAD been nice. Laying there in Anon\u2019s arms afterwards, watching the soft rise and fall of his chest as she tried to collect her thoughts. Lately, those thoughts kept skittering away from her, the ever-present and indecipherable fog that clouded her mind making it hard to focus, making it hard for her to understand what she felt about everything that had happened. What she felt about Anon. Anon had been like a lighthouse for her muddled thoughts, a beacon that guided her like a ship to safe harbor. But now, after finding out who had put that beacon there for her, who had played her like a damn fiddle, Fang wasn\u2019t sure how she felt anymore.\n\u2018Then why did you unplug his alarm?\u2019 A small voice inside her mind asked, interrupting her contemplations. \u2018Why text him on your way over here if you weren\u2019t sure what you felt about him? That voice grew louder whenever she thought of Anon, and no matter what she tried to silence it, it always came back. That voice had been VERY loud last night, singing a joyful tune the moment she had pulled him down to his bed. Now, at least, she had been able to reduce that voice to a buzz at the back of her mind, had been able to ignore it. She had to be able to ignore it, or else what she was about to do would be impossible.\nThinking of what she intended made her check her backpack again, made her feel the reassuring weight of the thing nestled beneath her notebooks and other school supplies. Fang chuckled softly: Volcano High had no security to speak of really, and yet she still had hidden that thing away at the bottom of her bag, feeling like everyone whom she passed on the way to school was looking at it. With any luck, her dad wouldn\u2019t notice it was missing until\u2026\n\u201cNo, Fang. None of those thoughts, not today.\u201d The small voice in her head cried out in agreement, attempting to divert her from what she had set out to do. Fang simply ignored it; she had gotten good at ignoring things lately.\n Cresting the stairs to the second floor, she glanced around the still-empty halls, shifting her backpack to unzip the main pocket. Naomi was on this floor, only a few doors down, where no doubt Little Miss Perfect was giving a presentation to some committee, or lecturing them on some other bullshit, or\u2026or\u2026 . Fang\u2019s hand clenched around the thing, still hidden in her backpack. She couldn\u2019t let anyone see it, not yet, not until it was too late.\nRoom 207. Fang\u2019s hand hesitated on the door handle, that small voice in her mind screaming at her through the fog. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Anon,\u201d Fang whispered, pushing open the door with one hand, the other still hidden in her backpack.\nAs one, all heads turned towards her as she stepped into the classroom. It was the Steering Committee: A group of students interested in the direction the school was headed, losers who planned school concerts, organized fundraisers, that kind of crap. Fang couldn\u2019t give less of a shit about that, though. She had found her quarry at last, standing at the podium at the front of the class, shock and confusion clouding her stupid pink face. With a hiss, Fang started to pull her dad\u2019s old service revolver out of her backpack\u2026\n\u201cFang? What are you doing here, are you okay?!\u201d A familiar voice wrenched Fang\u2019s eyes off of Naomi. It was Naser, standing up from his seat in the front row, his eyes positively sick with worry. Of course he would be here, Naomi wouldn\u2019t let him out of her sight, now that Fang was out of the way. Fang tried to pay him no mind, tried to ignore that voice in her head, screaming for her attention.\n\u201cFuck off, Naser, this doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d Fang\u2019s eyes narrowed at her brother as she fixed him with a withering glare. Inside, Fang\u2019s thoughts were racing as she desperately tried to organize something out of the fog. Naser wasn\u2019t supposed to be here, she had checked his schedule this morning: He was supposed to be at some dumb sports-day until lunch. He must\u2019ve changed at the last minute, or Naomi had\u2026 Of course. Naomi, sticking her nose where it didn\u2019t belong once more, meddling in Fang\u2019s life. No more.\nStanding there, Fang hadn\u2019t realized Naser was walking towards her, her line of sight on Naomi blocked by her sibling. \u201cFang, is something wrong?\u201d Naser\u2019s voice snapped Fang out of her daze at once, her eyes re-focusing. Gripping the cold handle of the revolver in her bag, she snarled once more, her teeth barred.\n\u201cI said GET OUT! Get the FUCK out of here, Naser!\u201d Screams rang out from the other students in the classroom, students Fang hadn\u2019t even noticed where there. She realized she had pulled her hand out of her backpack, brandishing the gun towards Naomi, towards Naser. The room suddenly went very still. \n\u201cFang, it\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Naser said slowly, holding his hands up, trying to get Fang\u2019s attention once more. \u201cLook, what happened at Prom, that was fucked up\u2026 Those guys had no right to do what they did, but, Fang, it\u2019s going to be okay...\u201d Naser\u2019s voice appeared calm, but Fang could see out of the corner of her eye his one good wing shaking, the same way it always did when he was afraid. Slowly, Naser took another step towards fang, walking down the row of desks, still blocking her line of sight to Naomi. \n\u201cOf course it\u2019s going to be okay, I\u2019m going to MAKE it okay,\u201d Fang hissed, spittle flying out of her mouth. Fang could see Naomi over Naser\u2019s shoulder, see her cowering behind her podium. \u201cIs this what was supposed to happen, was this how you wanted to \u2018fix\u2019 me? Was I just a, a PUZZLE to you?! Just an obstacle you had to get out of your way?!\u201d The gun rattled in Fang\u2019s hand as she gestured wildly, her motions eliciting more screams from the room.\nNaser had stopped moving, his eyes tracing the gun. \u201cFang, no one was trying to-\u201c\n\u201cSHE was trying to! Anon told me about your little plan, Naomi, how you set us up, made us the perfect little couple. How could you do that, how could you USE him like that?!\u201d Naomi had gone white as a sheet, her hands half-raised to protect herself. \u201cYou BITCH! I thought I loved him, and instead you just fucking USED him to make me think that!\u201d Fang\u2019s hand was steady now, the barrel aimed directly at Naomi. All she needed was for Naser to get out of her way, and\u2026 But Naser wasn\u2019t getting out of her way. Her sibling, who for some reason just would NEVER get out of her life, was still standing there. \n\u201cFang, please, people love you, I love you! Please Fang, j-just put the gun down, it\u2019s going to be okay\u2026\u201d Tears were spilling down Naser\u2019s cheeks now, matching the ones that ran down her own cheeks. Fang could see him getting closer now, could see him standing only a few feet away. \n\u201cNo Naser, it\u2019s not,\u201d Fang whispered softly, tightening her grip in the revolver. Naser\u2019s eyes went wide, his mothing failing to find his final words.\nSeveral things happened at once. Fang took a step to the side, attempting to clear her line of fire to Naomi. At the same time Naser leapt, throwing his body in the way, the shot intended for Naomi ripping through his abdomen. He landed on a desk with a heavy grunt, sending the whole thing clattering to the floor as he landed hard. One of the students screamed, their cry partially drowned out by the echoing of the gunshot. A metallic scent hung in the air, blue smoke rising from the gun still outstretched in Fang\u2019s arm. \nChaos erupted. Students flung themselves at the door in a desperate attempt to get away from Fang, from Naomi. Naomi herself could only scream, watching as Naser fell. She was still screaming as Fang stepped over the body of her sibling, holding the gun level with her face. The screaming stopped suddenly, another shot echoing through the classroom. Several of the students had been shoved mercilessly by their peers in the mad dash to the door, and were frantically scrambling to their feet as Fang turned away from what remained of Naomi. Some didn\u2019t even try to run when Fang pointed at them, their pleas for mercy silenced with a single gunshot. \nPanting, Fang tuned her attention to the open door, the noise from the frantic students echoing down the hall. She could feel her heart pounding, feel her ears ringing from the loud booms of the revolver echoing in the confined space of the classroom. Still clutching the revolver, she began running her other hand mechanically through her wing without noticing, her eyes glazed as she walked into the hall. Other students, initially curious at the shouts coming from room 207, were now cowering back in their rooms or in secluded corners of the hall, attempting to hide away from the growing carnage that was unfolding around them. More screams rang out, gunshots quickly silencing all who dared to speak. \nThe entire thing lasted barely over a minute. Fang found herself standing in the hall, all alone. She knew she had to stop, a part of her acutely aware of how many bullets she had left. All around, the bodies of students lay where they fell, blood already starting to pool. Fang walked by them all, unseeing, the small voice in the back of her mind sobbing at what she had done. Already the feathers were starting to fall as she continued to preen absent-mindedly, her wing covered with her own blood, the blood of others staining her legs. Fang walked on, past the dead and the dying, past the screaming and the crying, heading up the stairs to the roof where her final bullet would find its target. Thoughts of Anon ran through her head as legs moved mechanically, memories of the time they spent together, of the only happy time in her past few years. Fang could feel the tears starting to flow once more, thinking about Anon, and she hoped somehow he would never discover what she had done. Whispering to herself, Fang pushed open the door to the roof, opening the door to her own grave.\n\n\u201cGoodbye, Volcano High.\u201d   \n","Title":"Ending 1 - Fang's Got a Gun","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Naser and Naomi","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Ending 2.5 - Anon and Fang vs The World!.txt":{"path":["Fang","Ending 2.5 - Anon and Fang vs The World!.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending 2.5 - Anon and Fang vs The World!\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off \nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nSnootgame Ending 2.5: Anon and Fang vs The World\nA \"And she's always going on about her fucking plan.\"\nF \"Plan?\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh\"\n\"Oh fuck\"\n\"Well...I had planned to tell them sometime.

The two of us have been inseparable nearly this whole time I\u2019ve been back, it feels like a dream. Seeing Lucy again\u2026 Something inside of me just feels\u2026 complete. It\u2019s all I can do to let her go in the mornings, to look after the gaggle of kids at the church\u2019s day-care. Though, Lucy seems at-ease around the kids, more than she is when we\u2019re out on our nearly nightly dates. She tries to be strong, but I can see the pain and fear in her eyes when she walks near the places we used to go to as teenagers. Lucy nearly broke down in tears when we passed her old favorite guitar shop yesterday. While I\u2019ve tried to get her to take up music again, it\u2019s still too much, too fast. I know I\u2019ve got to take this slow, and savor every moment.\nToday, we\u2019re having dinner with her parents. Her family has been a big help, getting me set up with an apartment in a much nicer part of town than I lived in before. Ripley even offered to take me golfing, although I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to take him up on that offer just yet. For now though, any chance I can get to spend with Lucy is fine by me. \nStanding outside the day-care room, I wait for Lucy to get ready, browsing the pictures on the wall, each a poorly drawn symphony in crayon. The kids are out right now: Lucy said something about them getting their last psalm lesson for the day before their parents pick them up. A lot of the other staff at the church have been helping out, giving Lucy and I more time to get re-acquainted. Secretly, I think they just want us to get married as quickly as we can. I can see the half-hidden smiles when I talk to Lucy\u2019s church group, feel their eyes on our backs as I walk her home. Clearly, these people think Petro Estrus season is in full-swing, and I must be taking advantage of it!\n\u2026Not that they aren\u2019t wrong, though\u2026\n\u2026\nShould I be thinking about that in a church? \nA small cough and a tug on my pants legs snaps be back to reality. Turning away from the crayon scribbles, my face blushing, I have to re-adjust my gaze slightly before I can take in the interruption: A dozen or so dino-kids, none older than 6, stand around my ankles, each pair of eyes as big as saucers as they stare up at me. \nApparently all that training in special-forces doesn\u2019t amount to crap when faced with a horde of dino-tykes.\nOne such tyke, a bespectacled steggo boy of maybe four, gives my pants leg another tug, his small backpack gently clasped in his other hand.\n\u201cAre you Mister Anon?\u201d\nHis question immediately opens the flood gates, as the others pile on their voices.\n\u201cHe\u2019s scary!\u201d\n\u201cMissus Wucy said we can\u2019t talk to stwangers!\u201d\n\u201cAre all humans like him?\u201d\nSmiling, I move to crouch low on my heels, sending the kids shuffling back with barely-contained gasps. The little steggo boy holds his ground however, his glasses amplifying his wonderous gaze as he now stares at me face-to-face.\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s me,\u201d I say, holding out my hand. Somehow, the little boy\u2019s eyes go even wider as he reaches out his hand, mine own dwarfing it several times over as I give it a little shake. \u201cYou must be Ms. Lucy\u2019s class?\u201d\nThat seemed to have loosened them up a little. Kids aren\u2019t afraid of anything for long, and now that I was officially \u201cnot a stranger\u201d in their minds, they began crowding around me once more, small scaly hands measured against mine, little budding horns fingers as they gazed wondrously up at my chrome dome.\n\u201cWow!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sooooo cool!\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have any horns, Mister Anon?\n\u201cWhy are you scwales all soft and pink?\nLaughing, I let them clamber around me, pulling at my clothes as I struggle to answer their questions. \u201cNo, humans don\u2019t have horns, we have hair. No, no scales either. Yes, I am fully grown. No, not everyone has hair. No, I don\u2019t loose my hair-horns every season. Okay, maybe cool it with the hair questions, okay?\u201d\nUndeterred, the kids continue their verbal onslaught, poking and prodding me like I\u2019m the most interesting thing to crawl out from under a rock they\u2019ve seen all day. Just as I\u2019m starting to wonder what\u2019s keeping Lucy, a little girl at the back of the pack speaks up, her squeaky voice silent up until now.\n\u201cDo you wuv Missus Wucy?\u201d\nThe dino-tykes stop their badgering, settling down expectantly. I can feel my muscles clench slightly, a shiver of\u2026 something, running down my spine.\nSensing my weakness, the little girl chimes up again. \u201cMissus Wucy said she wuved someone, wonce. She, umm, said she felt com-fort-uh-bull wonce before, and now she says she feels, uh, the same way now.\u201d\nI never thought the one who would take me down like this would be wearing a pink frilly tutu and matching Dino-Pals sweatshirt. \nI\u2019m silent for a while, as I consider the little tyke\u2019s question. Finally, I smile once more, hoping to through this little assassin off her attack.\n\u201cMs. Lucy has had a some really tough times before, you know? I only knew her a short while, when we were big-kids, and I hoped I could help her through those rough times. See, she meant a lot to me back then, and she means maybe even more now. Love is a really\u2026 nice thing to have, for grown-ups, and I hope I can give her thiiiiiiiis much!\u201d Spreading my arms out wide, I attempt to indicate just how much love I hoped to give Lucy.\nThere wasn\u2019t enough room in the world to display that amount, however.\nImmediately, the dino-tykes are on me once more, each squeaky voice crying out their acceptance for me, letting me know how nice \u201cMissus Wucy\u201d was, and how much they were glad she could have someone again. I caught some of them reaching their arms out wide, mimicking my display, showing me just how much they loved Lucy too. \n\u201cWow, that\u2019s a wot!\u201d\n\u201cI wanna be like Anon when I grow up!\u201d\n\u201cMissus Lucy is cute! CUTE!\u201d\nGlancing up, I caught sight of Lucy through the open day-care door, having finally gathered up her things from the church office on the other side of the building. Quickly, I shushed the dino-tykes as best I could, holding up a finger to my lips until they all copied me.\n\u201cBut this is our secret, okay? We can\u2019t let Ms. Lucy find out, it\u2019s a surprise!\u201d The dino-tykes were eager to agree, shushing each other in turn as I sprang quickly to my feet. Lucy cocked an eyebrow questioningly as she entered the day-care, meeting me half-way as I moved towards her.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a surprise, Anon?\u201d Lucy asked as I took her hand in mine. Giving it a little squeeze, I just smiled, pressing my finger to my lips once more. The still-assembled dino-tykes did the same, nearly shushing Lucy in unison. Laughing, Lucy shook her head, smiling at her assembled class.\n\u201cOkay, well then it can be a secret! Kids, your mommies and daddies are here to come get you, so why you don\u2019t run over to Ms. Sarah so she can release you, okay?\u201d A cacophony of cheers greets Lucy\u2019s discharge, the little kids scampering around us to re-join their families. The little girl from before hesitates in front of us for a moment, looking up at us and nodding astutely before giving my leg a big hug and running off to join the rest of the class. Lucy\u2019s amber eyes catch mine, a look of utter bewilderment on her face.\n\u201cWhat was that all about, Anon?\u201d As we step out of the day-care, Lucy wraps her arm around mine as we head out to dinner. I can\u2019t help but smile as I glance down at her, drinking in the beauty of her face as we pass through the halls of the church.\n\u201cOh, you know how kids are, right? Sometimes, they\u2019re just who you need to talk to.\u201d I hold open the door, Lucy pausing for a second before turning to leave.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still such a dweeb, Anon.\u201d","Title":"Ending 3 - Anon and The Dino-Tykes","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Ending 3 - Light Inside.txt":{"path":["Fang","Ending 3 - Light Inside.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending 3 - Light Inside\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Trish, Stella and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Cobalt_Blue_Sphere\nSummary: She knew she was supposed to do better. She knew she was supposed to fix herself, but nothing worked out.\nShe knew with the certainty of truth that she was a weak person. For three years she lived, inflicting herself on no-one, and waited for the light to come back and shine on her again. But a light shining on the outside fixes nothing. Far from it; it only illuminates problems.\n\n\nI placed the heavy box down on the wood floor and wiped my brow. Moving was always a massive hassle, even back when I didn\u2019t have much stuff to cart around, but now that we were bringing Lucy\u2019s things as well, it was a downright nightmare. We hadn\u2019t quite needed a truck, but we\u2019d managed to pack a moving van full to the brim.\n\nStill, once it was over, it would all be out of the way. Better to just sack up and push through it.\n\nWe\u2019d found a decent sized little apartment together, not in Skin Row this time. Lucy had been set on moving out of her parents\u2019 place and living with me, and I was more than happy with that idea \u2013 but only after clearing it with her dad. Ripley\u2019s bad side was not something I ever wanted to be on. The big bad ptero patriarch had come around pretty quickly, thank God. I remember there\u2019d been a time when Lucy\u2019s mother would have to play mediator in any conversation between me and him, but nowadays he seemed almost glad that I was there.\n\nMind you, he\u2019d still clapped me on the shoulder and quietly but firmly reminded me to treat his daughter well... and then invited me to go golfing with him sometime. I just remembered what he said about that 9-iron and tried not to shudder. Even with the shit I\u2019d seen in the desert, he was something else.\n\nJust as I turned around to start heading back out to the van, Lucy came through the open doorway, several smaller boxes teetering in her arms. \u201cThese are the last few, Anon. Can you grab some off me?\u201d\n\nI pulled a few from the top of the tower and set them down, leaving her to kick the door shut before planting her boxes down next to mine.\n\n\u201cWhew! That\u2019s the lot of it!\u201d She clapped her hands together as we both stood up straight.\n\n\u201cYep, now we just need to actually unpack it,\u201d I remarked. Her face fell comically.\n\nOn the one hand, I was kind of thankful she hadn\u2019t wanted to bring her old piano along with us when I\u2019d asked. On the other though, I hadn\u2019t missed the wince on her face before she\u2019d started making excuses. \u2018Too much effort getting it up out of the basement\u2019, \u2018It was my grandma\u2019s, it should stay with mom and dad\u2019, \u2018It probably won\u2019t fit in the apartment\u2019.\n\nAll rang true enough as she gave them, I supposed. Wasn\u2019t hard to tell that she had another reason for saying them, though. And that she didn\u2019t want to even bring her guitar spoke volumes more.\n\nIt had been a few months since I\u2019d returned to Volcaldera, and I\u2019d spent as much of it with Lucy as I could, but I hadn\u2019t forgotten what she\u2019d said to me that first night. And since that day, I\u2019d... noticed a few things. The way her gaze lingered dolefully on the church organ every other time we attended Sunday mass, or how she\u2019d sported an outright woeful look at some kid\u2019s guitar case they\u2019d left in the foyer. The way she completely avoided talking about anything or anyone from Volcano High. The way she\u2019d pulled me down alternate routes to avoid going past the school every time she\u2019d walked home with me from the park. It was pretty obvious there was something amiss.  There was something... almost haunting her, I supposed. It had me worried.\n\nBut at the same time, I couldn\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t doing well in her own right. I was really impressed with how well she\u2019d been holding up since I\u2018d been deployed. Life might have taken a left turn, but she\u2019d still been moving forward \u2013 she had an associate\u2019s degree and steady employment teaching preschool.\n\nShe was tougher than she gave herself credit for.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Every other night I\u2019d racked my brains, trying to think of a way to help her be happy with everything she\u2019d done, but no easy answer ever came to me. I didn\u2019t have the heart to push her into anything she might not be ready for. I couldn\u2019t do that to her.\n\nWe\u2019d been apart for three years, and in that time, she\u2019d had no-one. She\u2019d lived in almost self-imposed exile that whole time. It didn\u2019t feel fair to even want to push her into anything, just a few short months after I\u2019d returned. It didn\u2019t feel right.\n\nI looked over to see her just standing there blankly looking at our belongings, seemingly having run out of energy.\n\n\u201cYou doing alright, Lucy?\u201d I broke the silence that had fallen. Almost immediately she snapped back to attention.\n\n\u201cYeah! Sorry, was just thinking. I know this\u2019ll sound stupid, but now that you\u2019re back... I really feel like I can mean something again.\u201d She beamed at me, then cast her hands out over the assorted boxes and bags. \u201cLike this is all a new start on life, you know? We\u2019ve actually got our own place! You know how long I\u2019ve been looking forward to this?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does kind of feel like that,\u201d I agreed as I returned her smile. \u201cWhich box did we put the plates in, do you remember? We should get something to eat before we start unpacking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t actually pack anything to eat in those boxes, Anon, plates aren\u2019t going to help us,\u201d She rolled her eyes. She seemed completely animated again. \u201cYou\u2019re right, though. Come on, let\u2019s just go out and grab something.\u201d\n\nI followed her out the door, leaving my worries with the boxes for now. I could think about it later.\n\n\n\nThat night was quiet as we settled into bed. We were both tired from the move, and there was still more for us to do tomorrow \u2013 neither of us were up for anything more. I laid in bed with Lucy tucked up tightly against my side, but despite the day\u2019s exertion sleep wasn\u2019t coming as easily to me as it had to her.\n\nHer wings were flopped down underneath the blanket, flat against the mattress. I never saw her looking like this when she was awake. She was always either abuzz with energy, busily making her way through the day, or completely spent, an absent look on her face as she did nothing at all just like yesterday. While she was asleep, though, she looked completely content, every bit as at peace with the world as that first night back we\u2019d spent together and simply stayed awake in each other\u2019s embrace.\n\nShe was precious like this.\n\nI must have fallen asleep at some point, because I don\u2019t remember admiring the view for long. The next thing I remember is Lucy\u2019s exuberant call waking me up at the crack of dawn. \u201cMorning, Anon! Time to get up!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? What time is it?\u201d I asked groggily. It was Sunday, I was pretty sure. No work.\n\n\u201cTime for you to get up,\u201d She repeated mischievously.  \u201cCome on, get your butt up off the bed. We\u2019ve got mass today, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right! Right,\u201d I got halfway up from under the blanket before I suddenly felt the bitter morning chill and retreated. \u201cUh... How about five more minutes.\u201d\n\nLucy folded her arms and cocked her head, eyebrows raised tauntingly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get up right now I\u2019m pulling that blanket right off.\u201d\n\nI froze up. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. You couldn\u2019t,\u201d I pleaded.\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. Instead, faster than I could see, she reached down and swiped the blanket away. I instinctively curled up a bit at the shock of cold that hit me, prompting a burst of laughter from her as she dropped the sheet back down in a heap on the floor.\n\n\u201cCome on, lazy ass. I\u2019m already getting breakfast ready, you could at least get up and eat it,\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019m getting up,\u201d I groaned, utterly defeated.\n\nBreakfast wasn\u2019t anything too crazy, with what little we had in the house, but the hot porridge helped chase away the cold. Lucy kept talking breezily as we sat down to eat.\n\n\u201cI think we should go and do some grocery shopping after mass. We need to get some stuff to put in the fridge before we finish unpacking. We don\u2019t have any dino nuggies, for one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeaven forbid you don\u2019t get your nuggies.\u201d I chuckled. Some things just didn\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cI need my nuggies, Anon!\u201d She pointed her spoon at me with mock seriousness. \u201cI\u2019ll go crazy without \u2018em!\u201d\n\nThe drive to the local church was quiet, but short \u2013 that was one of the reasons Lucy had been interested in the apartment in the first place. Previously we\u2019d both tagged along with Lucy\u2019s parents as they went to their local Sunday service, but now we were on our own. Our new church was an old building, not a trace of modernity to it at all \u2013 tall and ivy-covered, proudly bearing the proof of its endurance through the test of time.\n\nDefinitely a far cry from Skin Row.\n\nThe old triceratops pastor welcomed us in before the congregation began just as he had last week, and while Lucy returned the greeting enthusiastically, I still felt a little out of place. Lucy seemed to love it here, from how insistent she was about attending, but this wasn\u2019t exactly my element. We took our seats together amongst the rows of pews, up near the front where Lucy wanted. I sat patiently through the service, kneeling and genuflecting when it was called for \u2013 even if I didn\u2019t believe, I had respect for what Lucy had respect for.\n\nTowards the end of mass, though, my attention wandered a bit. My gaze fell upon the wooden pipe organ near the altar, off in the corner. I couldn\u2019t help but notice... well, how much it looked like a piano. A little larger, a little more ostentatious looking \u2013 and it looked like it had two rows of keys instead of just one. I wondered how much more complex it was to play than a regular piano.\n\n... I wondered if Lucy would know.\n\nBut it would be rude to ask in the middle of a service, so I held my breath until the pastor had given his last word and sent us off. As we shuffled out of the rows and made to join the crowd heading out of the building, I tugged her sleeve back and pointed.\n\n\u201cHey, Lucy. You seen that?\u201d\n\nShe followed my gaze. \u201cYeah? It\u2019s an organ,\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know how to play it?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cSort of. I mean, it\u2019s kinda harder than a piano, but kinda easier. There\u2019s less keys, but that can make it harder to find the notes you want. And they\u2019re in different places.\u201d\n\nFor a second I was actually distracted. \u201cWait, less? There\u2019s two whole rows on that thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but they\u2019ve got less keys on them each. Maths, Anon? You know that stuff?\u201d She laughed.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201c... I was just wondering if you\u2019d be able to play our song on it.\u201d\n\nShe eyed the instrument tentatively for a moment. \u201cHmmm... I dunno. Maybe? I could try \u2013\u201d\n\nAs though on autopilot she took one step toward it, then seemed to catch herself and freeze. It was like she\u2019d just suddenly realized exactly what she was talking about.\n\n\u201cI, ah... I don\u2019t know if I want to,\u201d She said. She was facing away from me but I could hear the sudden shot of nerves in her voice.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d I assured her. \u201cI just thought we could ask is all. Just if you\u2019re up for it,\u201d\n\nShe turned back to me then, and I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what I saw on her face. Trepidation? Fear? Panic? All of the above perhaps, but behind it there was something more welcome. Something earnest, something that still hoped for better. Her gaze met mine for a moment, before falling away.\n\nShe stayed silent, waiting for me to answer, but I didn\u2019t know what answer to give. I wasn\u2019t sure if I should push it or not. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was right or wrong to ask more of her. I was certain she wasn\u2019t really happy, having left music behind completely.\n\nBut wasn\u2019t that her decision to make?\n\n\u201c...Do you want to ask the pastor and see what he says?\u201d I finally asked.\n\nShe turned away to face the organ again, and was silent for a long while. The crowd had long since left the church, leaving just us and the old pastor, looking curiously down at us from beside the altar.\n\nShe sucked in a deep breath. \u201c... Yeah. Yeah, sure. Can\u2019t hurt to ask.\u201d\n\nIt was a weight off my heart to hear her say that. It was a relief to know that on some level, to some degree she still hoped for better just like I did. I came up beside her and wrapped one arm around her shoulders, and in response she drew me in closer with one wing as we walked up to the altar together.\n\n\u201cGood morning, Lucy and... Anon, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d The leathery old triceratops asked. I nodded my affirmation. Lucy had talked to him a little bit last week, but I hadn\u2019t, and I was surprised he remembered my name at all. \u201cExcellent. Forgive me, I\u2019m poor with names at the best of times. I\u2019m glad to see you both again. Was there something about the sermon you wanted to discuss?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Father,\u201d Lucy spoke hesitantly, looking up at me uncertainly for a brief moment before continuing. \u201cI was... actually just wondering... if I could be allowed to play a song on the organ?\u201d\n\nHe seemed taken aback for a moment, but nodded graciously. \u201cCertainly. I didn\u2019t know you played,\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t, really, I\u2019ve only really played piano,\u201d She murmured as she sat down and smoothed her dress out. \u201cI know they\u2019re similar, though,\u201d\n\nHer fingers brushed tentatively over the keys at first, and for a while her notes were purely experimental, little more than deep, bassy noise as she figured her way around the keys. The pastor and I both sat quietly on the front pew as she worked through her practice, finding rhythms and dropping them as fast again.\n\nI could see a small smile on her face as she focused, and it brought a smile to my own. This was her element.\n\nFinally she let out a long exhale and leaned back. \u201cAlright, I think I might be able to... Let me see...\u201d\n\nShe began more slowly than she had on piano or guitar, letting the deep thrum of the organ\u2019s voice resonate through the tremendous old building. The difference between her practicing and her playing was immediately apparent \u2013 the melody surrounded us, momentous in a way I\u2019d never heard it before, demanding utter attention from its rapt listeners. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes away from Lucy as she seemingly channelled her soul into the music. Before long she was throwing her back into it, as consumed by the music as myself and the pastor.\n\nIt brought me back to better times. Before I\u2019d gone away to the desert. Before I\u2019d left Lucy alone. She\u2019d called herself broken since I left, but I could see in her right now the same spirit as I had when she\u2019d played before.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but wonder what might have happened if I\u2019d done things even a little differently. I heard in the music all the things that never were, the heights she could have reached if things had gone as she\u2019d deserved.\n\nThe last reverent note fell away slowly, and I let out a breath I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been holding. Even on an instrument she wasn\u2019t familiar with, she\u2019d commanded the music with aplomb.\n\nShe looked exhilarated as she turned back to face me, a broad smile running across her face.\n\n\u201cThat was astounding,\u201d The old pastor broke the stunned silence. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you played at all, but you\u2019ve got quite the talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I \u2013\u201d She chuckled, rubbing her neck embarrassedly. \u201cIt\u2019s not as different from the piano as I thought. I haven\u2019t really played organ much...\u201d\n\n\u201cThat only makes it even more impressive, really. I\u2019ve never heard anything quite like that. Have you ever considered playing for the choir?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t...\u201d She murmured, looking my way for a moment. I gave her an assuring nod. \u201c... But I think I could, maybe.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvery week since then she played the organ for the Sunday mass. We had to leave even earlier in the morning to make sure everything was set up properly, and our Saturday mornings were spent on rehearsal with the choir. Or rather, her Saturday mornings were spent on rehearsal, while I sat in the rows and looked on.\n\nI was happy to be there. I wanted to support her, I didn\u2019t want to leave her alone any more than she wanted to face the music on her own.\n\nDespite playing to perfection each time, she always looked nervous before each service, and exhausted afterwards. An hour or so later she would be back to her peppy self, but I was beginning to suspect lately that she was putting on a front to at least some degree. She\u2019d never really spoken excitedly of getting to play for the choir, not once said she was happy doing what she was doing.\n\nAfter that performance she\u2019d poured her heart into, I\u2019d thought the choir might simply bring her out of her shell a little bit. Now, though,  I was growing concerned that it might be taking more of a toll on her than I\u2019d realized.\n\n\u201cAre you alright, Lucy?\u201d After our third mass at that church, I decided to ask her about it as I drove us home.\n\n\u201c... I\u2019m alright. It\u2019s just... exhausting, Anon,\u201d She murmured after a moment, looking vacantly ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as when I played our song. I feel like I\u2019m dying a bit every time I go up there and play.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? But you play so well. It always sounds amazing,\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d She gave me a small smile, but it fell as quickly as it had come. \u201c... I\u2019m sorry. I should be enjoying it, I know, but... it only feels like hard work.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to be sorry for. If you\u2019re not comfortable doing it, we should talk to the pastor about it.\u201d\n\nShe shook her head vehemently. \u201cNo! I can do it. It\u2019s just... harder than it should be, is all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to push yourself if you\u2019re not ready, Lucy.\u201d I reminded her gently. \u201cIt\u2019s better to take it slow.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I can\u2019t just let everyone down like that,\u201d She insisted, wringing her hands in her lap. \u201c... I\u2019ve been doing that way too long as it is. Now you\u2019re here, I... I have to really try.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to feel. Did she really want to go to that kind of length just for me? Only for my sake \u2013 not for hers? On some level I was touched, but I didn\u2019t want to think that she only playing because she felt she had to, that she felt some sense of obligation to show the church her music instead of any real want to do it.\n\n\u201c... You should only do it if it makes you happy, Lucy,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cNot if it makes anyone else happy. Not even me.\u201d\n\nShe was silent for almost a minute, keeping her head down as I kept my eyes on the road.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what makes me happy anymore, Anon,\u201d She whispered finally. \u201cI really don\u2019t. I love working with the preschoolers, but I always feel like I\u2019m just wasting my time doing nothing. I can\u2019t stop them from growing up and fucking up like us. And I don\u2019t... Well, I don\u2019t even really like playing music. I know I\u2019m good at it, but it just doesn\u2019t make me happy. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\n\nShe heaved a great breath before she continued, words spilling out of her. \u201cI know I\u2019m meant to be doing something, but I don\u2019t know what. I should have tried to be a star or something, but I just couldn\u2019t. I miss the band, I miss Trish and Reed, but... but at the same time, I can\u2019t stand the thought of them both. Trish tried to screw my whole life up, and Reed... he just let her.\u201d\n\nIn the car I couldn\u2019t do much more than give her a reassuring squeeze. \u201cHey \u2013 It\u2019s alright. Don\u2019t beat yourself up about what happened in the past. We\u2019ll get through this. We\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. I know we will. It just all hurts,\u201d She sighed, a wisp of a smile in her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re the only thing I really know anymore, Anon. I love you.\u201d\n\nDespite my worry it still sent a thrill through me just to hear her say that. \u201cI love you too, Lucy.\u201d\n\n \n\nAs usual, the mask came back on, and Lucy returned to her exuberant self within a few minutes of us arriving home.  We did some shopping together, cooked dinner, went for a short evening walk, watched television for a short while. A perfectly normal day, and she gave no indication that it was anything more or less than that, but I could feel an undercurrent to it. Words that neither of us wanted to speak or hear spoken. We both just wanted to be normal. We both wanted to feel happy.\n\nAnd the happiness we had was genuine enough that neither of us could stand to disrupt it.\n\nI pulled her close as we slept that night, and I couldn\u2019t say that it was entirely for her comfort alone. I didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to do for her. Her weight against my side and her wing draped over us beneath the blanket was just barely a reassuring enough presence to lull me to sleep.\n\nShe was still the woman I loved, no matter what. And she was still there.\n\nIn the early morning, however, she wasn\u2019t. In the dull hazy state of being half-awake, the first thing I noticed was that she was gone, and I jolted out of bed in a panic.\n\n\u201cAnon?\u201d I heard her quiet voice in the gloom. I was instantly relieved that she was still there.\n\nI flicked on the lamp on our bedside table and looked over to see her standing by the window, looking back over her shoulder at me with a wan smile. It was raining gently outside, streaking down the window and casting the world in grey.\n\n\u201cLucy?\u201d\n\nShe turned back to the window, ruffling her wings slightly before letting them droop back down. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Anon. I\u2019m right here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d I asked, throwing the blanket off and ignoring the cold as I slowly picked myself up out of bed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. Before the sun came up,\u201d She murmured.\n\n\u201c... What are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust watching the rain. I couldn\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m sorry if I upset you, Anon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not upset, don\u2019t worry. I was just confused for a second,\u201d I reassured her as I came up beside her. Almost immediately she reached out with both an arm and a wing, pulling me in close and leaning against me as if her life depended on it. \u201cDid you have a nightmare?\u201d\n\n\u201cN-No, I just...\u201d Her voice cracked for a second, and she gulped audibly before forcing herself to keep going. \u201cIt\u2019s just... m-my... my wings were so itchy... But I don\u2019t want to \u2013 to... I promised not to...\u201d\n\nI swear I felt my blood chilling in my veins. Immediately I thought back to the time I\u2019d sat on the blood-speckled rooftop of Volcano High with her, all ripped wings and scattered feathers and heartfelt honesty. Almost on instinct I pulled her in closer, prompting another wracking sob from her as she buried her head into my chest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Lucy,\u201d I whispered to her. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Talk to me. Tell me about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just \u2013 I fucking \u2013 I just want \u2013\u201d A hiccup punctuated each long-repressed sob. \u201cI just want to be happy again but I just don\u2019t know how anymore. I... I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing anymore! I can\u2019t be a good wife for you, I don\u2019t know how. I\u2019m just... living the same way I always have and trying to copy my mom, but I feel like an idiot all the time! I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing anything right, and I can\u2019t even play music like I used to anymore...\u201d\n\nThe words fell out of her in an unstemmable tide \u2013 so I didn\u2019t try. I just held her tightly and rocked us both gently as we stood, offering what comfort I could and hoping that it was enough for the pain and grief to escape her.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t improved myself at all. I\u2019m the same shit person as before, always fucking things up for everyone. I haven\u2019t gotten anywhere with anything in three years, Anon. I just fell apart and I never got anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fuck things up for me, Lucy. I\u2019ll never think that.\u201d I believed that with all my heart, and wanted nothing more than to convince her of it, too. I just didn\u2019t know how. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of love to give, and I wish you could see that you deserve as much for yourself as you give to me.\u201d\n\nShe looked up at me miserably. \u201cBut I don\u2019t deserve it, Anon. I\u2019m broken. You\u2019re the only thing that\u2019s still good in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re broken, Lucy. I think you\u2019re way stronger than you believe.\u201d I said, trying my utmost to let the certainty of truth through into my words. \u201cLife\u2019s just hard sometimes. Holding on as well as you have is more than you can ask out of a lot of people. You\u2019re tougher than you think you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy life\u2019s not that \u2013\u201d She started to voice her protest, but abruptly stopped as a look of realization stole over her tear-stained face. \u201cAnon...  I\u2019ve never asked. But I should have. What was it like while you were in the desert?\u201d\n\nThose memories were the last things I wanted to dredge up at this moment, but how could I just blow her off when she asked? She\u2019d seen my scars before, of course she had \u2013 we shared a bed. But I\u2019d never told her the stories of how I\u2019d gotten them, for one simple reason.\n\nAs far as I was concerned, they didn\u2019t have any stories. They were just things. Things I\u2019d moved past and allowed myself to forget. Things I\u2019d never wanted to dwell on, because I knew if I had, they would have become a part of me. The only thing I allowed myself to remember about them was thinking once in the infirmary that if I let myself think about them any more than I had, I wouldn\u2019t be able to go back to a life without them.\n\n\u201c... Hard,\u201d I said finally, earning a reluctant, choked-up chuckle from her as I struggled to think of something serious to say. \u201cIt... Well, no, it really was hard. I did a lot of things I\u2019m not happy with. But I did what I had to, I got through it, and... it\u2019s over now. I\u2019m back here.\u201d\n\nHer question came slowly, and full of fearful trepidation. \u201cDid... Did you ever shoot anyone?\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to answer or not. \u201c... Yeah. Yeah, I did.\u201d\n\nShe looked up at me wide-eyed. \u201c... What was it like?\u201d\n\nIt was a million things all at once, none of which I wanted to say. God, none of which could probably do it justice even if I did say them. I couldn\u2019t convey everything that had run through my head after I\u2019d taken my first shot at a real person, all the long hours I\u2019d spent trying to sort through those emotions in my head, and the even longer hours trying to push myself not to dwell on them. I liked to think I\u2019d done a pretty good job. I\u2019d come away from shit that broke a lot of people intact, both physically and mentally \u2013 as far as I could tell anyway. But all that hard work would come undone if I let it. If I forgot it, and lived my life without it \u2013 well, that was as much as anyone could ask for.\n\n\u201cBad.\u201d I shook my head dumbly. \u201cJust... bad. I get that sounds stupid, but I really can\u2019t put it any better than that, Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll those scars you got...\u201d My heart fell even further in my chest. I knew what she was about to say. \u201c... You got shot at too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I did. Not all of them were from that, but... Yeah.\u201d\n\nShe fell silent for a long moment, her head downcast as she turned her gaze back out the window.\n\n\u201cGod, Anon. My life\u2019s nowhere near as hard as what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d She murmured tonelessly. \u201cI got no right to be complaining next to you. My life\u2019s been nothing in comparison.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Just because I\u2019ve been in some shit, doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t been in any.\u201d I said firmly. \u201cNo point in comparing how hard or easy our lives have been. Someone else struggling harder than you doesn\u2019t mean you still aren\u2019t struggling yourself. I really am so impressed with how well you\u2019ve done for yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201c... I just don\u2019t understand how you think that, Anon,\u201d Her voice was barely a whisper as she let her head droop down against my chest again. \u201cCompared to everyone else, I\u2019m useless. My mom, my brother, y-you...\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not, Lucy. You\u2019ve got to stop thinking like that. I can\u2019t stand seeing you hurt yourself like this,\u201d I insisted quietly as I ran one hand through her long hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve just been going through some rough times, but that\u2019ll change. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\nShe seemed to relax somewhat in my arms then. I\u2019m not certain how long we stayed together like that, just standing and watching the rain patter down against the window. Neither of us spoke, and by degrees her staccato sobs slowed and stopped. Even then I didn\u2019t want to pull away, though.\n\nIt wrenched my heart to hear her putting herself down like this. I wanted to help her, but I didn\u2019t know how. I could tell her to be proud of herself and happy with what she\u2019d managed until I was blue in the face, but it wouldn\u2019t help if she just didn\u2019t want to do it. There was still a flame within her, sputtering slightly but burning hot \u2013 but it was burning her up from the inside. The pride and strength I\u2019d come to see in her that semester in Volcano High was undoubtedly still there, but she now feared it, hated it, and refused to acknowledge it.\n\nI didn\u2019t understand. All I knew for certain was that something had to give. She felt more fragile than ever as I held her that morning, like she might have collapsed under the weight of a single raindrop. Like she bore an unspeakable, invisible agony that made her frail and brittle enough to simply fall apart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to forget the pain, Lucy. Keep  the happy memories, but forget the pain,\u201d I felt compelled to speak as that thought hit me. A younger me might never have said it, but after what I\u2019d been through, I knew it for a fact. There was just no other way. \u201cTrust me. What\u2019s done is done. There\u2019s no good in dwelling on it, no matter how bad it was. Forget the pain, but remember the good times. Remember what they used to mean to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow? How do you do that?\u201d She looked up at me again, a hint of red desperation in her amber eyes.\n\n\u201cThinking of something else. For me in the desert, it was thinking of you. Thinking of how I wanted to come back and see you, and how good my life would be again once I did.\u201d I drew her in tight again. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t disappointed me, Lucy. You\u2019re nowhere near useless. You\u2019ve got no idea how happy you make me.\u201d\n\n\u201c... Thank you, Anon,\u201d I saw the faintest beginnings of a wan smile on her face. \u201cI\u2019m alright now. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, it\u2019s alright,\u201d I reassured her again. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you, Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, I just don\u2019t want to be a bother,\u201d She said as she pulled away at last. \u201cAnd, anyway... we both have to go to work. It\u2019s probably about time we started getting ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re alright to?\u201d I asked her gently.\n\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be okay,\u201d She insisted, looking up at me with a wan smile. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be okay today, Anon. Come on \u2013 I\u2019ll get started on breakfast.\u201d\n\n \n\nAfter work that day, I made another stop. Well, to be honest I shouldn\u2019t call it work. Technically recruitment was still duty, but it felt a lot more like work than active service, so hell, it may as well be work.\n\nWhenever I hadn\u2019t been busy, I\u2019d been thinking of Lucy. She was instantly on my mind when there as nothing else to occupy it. I\u2019d considered sending her a message earlier in the day to ask how she had been going, but decided against it. She\u2019d promised she\u2019d be okay. If I couldn\u2019t trust her on that, how could I trust her on anything? And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that if I was going to help her at all, I really was going to have to trust her.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tear down the walls she\u2019d put up to protect herself. The thought of that felt like an irredeemable overstepping of boundaries. It simply wasn\u2019t my place to make that call for her, but it might be possible for me to show her she didn\u2019t need those walls. If I could just show her the resilience I knew she had, if she could realize exactly how tough a person she was, she would be able to decide to hammer them down herself.\n\n... or she could decide not to. The thought struck me that the effort might be futile, that she might not want to embrace herself anymore \u2013 or might not even be able to. But when I thought back to yesterday morning, how she\u2019d mentioned feeling tempted to preen again, I knew I couldn\u2019t just leave her to suffer. She wasn\u2019t happy. She needed to be offered the choice... and I needed to accept it if she refused.\n\nIt was her call to make at the end of the day. Not mine.\n\nThe solution had to lie at Volcano High. Over the years I\u2019d been away, Lucy had cut herself off from the world, but in that semester, she\u2019d been growing steadily more outgoing, more confident, more... genuine, I supposed. Right up until that last night, wherein I was starting to suspect she\u2019d been so badly shaken that she\u2019d felt she had no choice but to back away from life entirely.\n\nI had a feeling I might know where the crux of the issue was. I had to talk to Trish.\n\n... Finding her was another matter, of course. I had no idea where she\u2019d gone since that semester. She\u2019d ducked out of prom night just like Lucy and I had, and she\u2019d been as good as her promise. To my knowledge she\u2019d not spoken to Lucy since then. I remembered her words, though. She only wanted Lucy to be happy, she\u2019d said.\n\nI hoped she hadn\u2019t changed her mind over the years. I hoped I could locate her to find out.\n\nAnd so I found myself at the base of the long stairway up to the school. The building hadn\u2019t changed much at all, still as tall and ivy-covered as the last day I\u2019d seen it. It was past school hours now so the place appeared quiet, but the office should still be open.\n\nA fearful flicker of doubt nagged at me as I climbed the stairs, telling me that the trepid woman I\u2019d married was the true Lucy, the happier Lucy, and that the confidence of her Fang persona was nothing more than an act. I couldn\u2019t shake the thought of the way she\u2019d acted in that semester being nothing more than a mask she\u2019d put on to hide her weakness.\n\nBut I had to believe in the strength of that flickering flame I knew was there. I had to trust that she was strong enough not to snap and hide behind her new mask of happiness forever.\n\nWith a steeling breath, I walked through the sliding doors and headed over towards the reception. A vaguely familiar lime green stegosaurus was behind the desk, busily tapping away on a keyboard. She left her work and turned her attention to me with a polite smile as I approached.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, can I help \u2013\u201d The voice clinched it. Seemingly at the same time as I recognized her, Stella recognized me. Immediately her eyes lit up and her clearly practiced demanour vanished. \u201cAnon! Hey! It\u2019s you! How have you been? Where have you been? I thought you died!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thought I died?\u201d I asked, bewildered for a moment. That was where she jumped to?\n\nStella had never seemed to be entirely there, as I remembered her. She walked to her own beat, did her own thing, and owned it completely. Never seemed to have a care for what anyone thought of her. I\u2019d kind of envied her for that, even if just seeing her reminded me unpleasantly of my own weeb phase. It was good to see that even now she still seemed exactly as I remembered her.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, you just went totally off the grid, Anon! I tried to keep in contact with everyone from school, but I couldn\u2019t get a hold of you. You and a few other people,\u201d She explained, a slightly fretful note in her voice despite the smile on her face. \u201cWow, I remember you being a lot less bulky. What have you been doing with yourself all this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry about that, Stella. I\u2019ve been deployed,\u201d I answered with a shrug.\n\n\u201cDeployed? Like in the army? Wow, that\u2019s pretty cool! I never would have thought you\u2019d end up going that way in life.\u201d She remarked with an impressed look. \u201cI guess that\u2019d explain the silence, though. What was it like? Was it exciting?\u201d\n\nI cringed inwardly. \u201c... Exciting\u2019s one word for it, sure. It wasn\u2019t exactly a holiday, though, Stella.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d She asked excitedly, before the realization of what she was asking very visibly hit her. \u201cOh. Oh, right. Sorry...\u201d\n\nI waved her off. I just wanted to move the conversation away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. What about you? How long have you been working here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, a few years now. I was just an assistant at first, but look at me now \u2013 on the front desk, all by myself!\u201d She threw her arms out and beamed proudly. \u201cI gotta say though, it does feel kinda strange. Do you know what I mean? I mean, I used to go to this school, and now I\u2019m still here, but on staff instead. It\u2019s weird how life works out sometimes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t it just, I didn\u2019t say. \u201cNeat. What else have you been up to? Still doing your tarot readings and stuff?\u201d\n\nTo my surprise, she gave a small shrug. \u201cOh, well... Not so much, really. I never had much chance to do readings for anybody after graduation, except Rosa, but I can tell she gets tired of it. I\u2019ve sort of just... stopped with that stuff, I guess.\u201d\n\nI was taken aback. Maybe not exactly as I remembered, then. Was everybody I knew just giving things up? \u201cWhat about those good old Chinese cartoons you used to love?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re Japanese, Anon, and I know you know that full well!\u201d A mischievous smile ran across her beaked face. \u201cI still haven\u2019t forgotten that presentation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh god, I\u2019d hoped people would have by now...\u201d I groaned.\n\n\u201cMaybe everyone else will, but not me! I wasn\u2019t lying by the way, she really is a great waifu and I really do love her. \u201d\n\n\u201cGee, thanks, Stella,\u201d I chuckled embarrassedly. Once again I felt like this conversation had to move along, the faster the better.\n\nStella, on the other hand, didn\u2019t seem to feel that at all, her smile only growing wider. \u201cHave you ever seen ToraDora, Anon? I watched it just recently, it\u2019s great! You should come over sometime and we can watch it together, I\u2019ve been trying to get Rosa to but she just won\u2019t. If you were there, though... I mean, she\u2019d like to see you again too, I bet!\u201d\n\n\u201c... Maybe some other time. I actually came her to ask you something, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nHer brows furrowed. \u201cOh. Sure, what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just wondering if it would be possible to get a hold of any of Trish\u2019s contact details,\u201d I asked slowly. Now that I thought about it, I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how to explain why I wanted them. Hopefully she just wouldn\u2019t ask.\n\n\u201cTrish? Hm, I remember her. She\u2019s another one I haven\u2019t talked to since graduation... What did you want to talk to her about? If you don\u2019t mind me asking. Is it about the presentation?\u201d\n\nDamn. \u201cNo, it\u2019s... for Lucy\u2019s sake,\u201d\n\n\u201cLucy...? Oh, Fang, right!  I remember!\u201d She gasped. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten her actual name, sorry... Are you and her still together? I haven\u2019t gotten to talk to her either, is she going by Lucy again? That\u2019s... good! I think?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just going through a bit of a rough time right now,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of why I was hoping you could point me towards Trish. They didn\u2019t part on the best of terms...\u201d\n\nShe looked up at me uncomfortably for a moment. \u201c... Uh, well... Strictly speaking I\u2019m not supposed to give you anything like that unless there\u2019s a real serious reason, Anon, since you don\u2019t have any relation to her. I could probably get in big trouble for that... Also, any details I gave you would be out of date by now, you know. She hasn\u2019t been here for three years, after all,\u201d\n\nMy crestfallen look must have shown on my face, because she immediately resumed talking without waiting for a response.\n\n\u201cBut! ... For Fang \u2013 er, Lucy\u2019s sake, I\u2019d be happy to give you what I\u2019ve got. Just as long as you don\u2019t tell anybody who told you...\u201d\n\n\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d A spark of hope was blooming in my chest.\n\n\u201cAlright, just give me a minute here, I\u2019ll look it up...\u201d She turned her attention back to her computer. \u201cHey, uh... When you and her have time... if she doesn\u2019t mind... would it be okay if I called you guys sometime? Like I said, I\u2019m trying to keep in contact with people from school. It\u2019d be great to talk to you guys again...\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, Stella, but... maybe not for a little while, alright?\u201d I answered. Her face fell and immediately I felt guilty. The last thing I wanted was to fob her off when she\u2019d been nothing but nice. \u201cWe can swap numbers if you got a bit of paper spare, but... well, we just might not be able to call for a while.\u201d\n\nShe brightened up again slightly, quickly passing me a blank sticky note and a pen. \u201cSure! Yeah, that\u2019s fine, it doesn\u2019t have to be tomorrow or anything. I\u2019d just like to see you guys again. Rosa would, too,\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019d be nice. How\u2019s she going, by the way? \u201d I asked as I scrawled my number down.\n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s just peachy. I still talk to her every other day. She runs a florist\u2019s now!\u201d She seemed to find what she was looking for on the computer with a satisfied noise, reaching across her desk again for another sticky note. She spared me a glance as she did. \u201cMaybe sometime we can all meet up and catch up with each other. That\u2019d be fun,\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d I concurred. \u201cJust...\u201d\n\n\u201cNot right now, I know,\u201d she nodded sagely as she passed me her note. \u201cHere. This is her last home number and address we\u2019ve got. And mine\u2019s on the back.\u201d\n\nI pocketed it gratefully, and handed her my own in turn. \u201cThanks Stella. I really appreciate this,\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem, Anon. I better get back to work, but hey... Don\u2019t run off again, alright? It was really nice to see you again after all this time. And tell Lucy I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from her, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHey, Anon! Dinner\u2019s done!\u201d Lucy called from the kitchen.\n\n\u201cComing!\u201d I called back, putting down the papers I\u2019d been flicking through.\n\nIn truth I hadn\u2019t really needed to be doing anything. These enlisted dossiers didn\u2019t need to be sorted through right away. Lucy had shooed me out of the kitchen when I\u2019d offered to help, insisting that it was her job and I should leave her to it. I wasn\u2019t sure how to argue without seeming like a jerkass, so I\u2019d left her to it as she said, but that left me with nothing to do. It didn\u2019t feel right for me to be doing nothing while she worked, even if it was what she wanted, and as a result, I\u2019d turned to doing work that didn\u2019t need to be done for a good while yet.\n\nIt struck me that she might be trying a bit too hard at this. I didn\u2019t exactly need a big, fancy dinner every other night to be happy. In fact I\u2019d probably just end up getting fat that way, and it wasn\u2019t like I couldn\u2019t cook myself in any case. I wasn\u2019t sure how to say that to her, though. She seemed so proud of herself when she did this kind of thing. Normal, domestic stuff. Wife stuff, I supposed. It was such a far cry from the Fang of old, but she went about it with such aplomb that some days I had to admit I\u2019d found myself really asking whether that had been the true Lucy, or whether this was her now in front of me.\n\nIt almost felt like poison to my own mind just thinking it, but she seemed so in her element now. She always talked about her day at the kindergarten so enthusiastically, laughing her head off as she told me all about what mischief the kids had been up to that day. She would listen intently even if I had barely anything to tell her about my own day in turn. She cooked to perfection each night, and she kept the apartment clean with a zeal that reminded me of Rosa tending to her flowers back at school. She was going above and beyond.\n\nBut always the mask slipped off, and always just when she thought I wasn\u2019t looking. The way her face would harden with bitterness sometimes sent a chill down my spine, and whenever I saw her vacantly staring out into nothingness, wrapped up in something she didn\u2019t want to share, I could swear I felt that chill spread through the whole room. After the episode this morning, with her thoughts of self-harm returning in force, I knew for certain it was hollow. I knew she was doing it all for my sake, not for her own.\n\nI thought back to that day I first reunited with her, when she told me of how badly she\u2019d suffered alone. She wasn\u2019t meant to be like this. She wasn\u2019t happy; she was distracted. Even I could tell she poured such energy into these simple tasks not finding fulfilment in them, only hoping that she would someday down the line. She had such a spark within her, but so little light made it out to the surface now.\n\nSomething had to give, sooner or later. I couldn\u2019t bear it if she broke down entirely.\n\nIn contrast to my heavy thoughts, she looked particularly exuberant as I entered the room, humming a tune to herself as she plated up. The warmth of the kitchen was comforting in a way I couldn\u2019t explain as I sat down at the table.\n\n\u201cRoast veggies and meat loaf,\u201d She announced happily. \u201cHomemade, too. The good stuff, Anon. So if you tell me it\u2019s anything less than perfect, I\u2019ll have to kick your ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it, Lucy,\u201d I let myself laugh along with her.\n\nShe continued chattering as we started eating. \u201cSo the silliest thing happened at work today. Julian \u2013 I don\u2019t remember if I\u2019ve told you about him, the little stegosaur, big troublemaker \u2013 I got him a cup of water, and he just ran outside straight away and tipped it up in the sandpit. And then, right, he takes the mud, or sand mud, whatever \u2013 and just starts rubbing it all over his face!\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? He sounds like a handful,\u201d I remarked bemusedly. She really did love the kids and their antics, and she loved regaling me with tales about them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not even the half of it. This was like ten minutes before home time, so we just barely managed to get him cleaned up in time. Anyway, his parents come in and pick him up, and as they\u2019re leaving he pulls away and dives right back into it. Face first.\u201d\n\nThat actually got a snort out of me. This kid was definitely going places. \u201cDid you have to \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cYep, we had to clean him up again,\u201d Lucy had a mock grimace on her face as she interjected  before bursting into a fit of sniggers. \u201cThey kept him in an iron grip when they were walking him out the second time, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood thing they did, imagine having to clean him up three times.\u201d I said in between bites of meat loaf. It was as good as anything else she\u2019d ever put up on a plate. I couldn\u2019t deny she had a talent for cooking.\n\n\u201cPass, pass, and pass.\u201d Lucy laughed. \u201cWhat about you? How was work?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally slow. Mostly just paperwork. Planning for an event next month,\u201d I shrugged.\n\n\u201cHow come you were so late back, then? Was there that much?\u201d She asked curiously, taking her eyes off the plate for a moment.\n\nI knew she wouldn\u2019t like to hear it, but I was going to have to say it eventually anyway. \u201cWell... I stopped by Volcano High, actually.\u201d\n\nJust as I\u2019d thought it would, the mood in the room changed instantly. Lucy winced and paused for a moment, immediately on edge at the mere mention of the school. Very slowly she resumed eating, carefully as though trying not to provoke a predator.\n\n\u201c... Oh. What for?\u201d It was plain in her voice that she didn\u2019t want to be part of the conversation anymore, but neither did she want to pretend anything was wrong.\n\nI heaved a sigh and decided to rip the bandage off. \u201cLucy, I think you should talk to Trish.\u201d\n\nNow she froze up completely, beak halfway open, eyes trained on her fork halfway up to her mouth. \u201c... Why? I don\u2019t want to talk to her, Anon. I don\u2019t need her anymore, after what she did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2013 Look, Lucy. You haven\u2019t been the same since I got back. You said it yourself, you feel like you\u2019re broken,\u201d Her face contorted in a pained grimace as she put her fork back down and stared at her plate. I felt like the biggest piece of shit on the face of the earth saying that, but it had to be said. \u201cI just think \u2013 if you think you are broken, then it might help put you back together. You\u2019re not happy like this, I can see how it\u2019s still hurting you. I can see you carry that weight around every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to talk to her, Anon,\u201d She whimpered. \u201cShe nearly screwed my whole life up. Everyone just hated me more when I started doing that non-binary shit, and she just kept pushing me into it. I didn\u2019t even realize she was doing it until you came along, but she was! The whole time, she was...\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she realized it either, Lucy,\u201d I said gently. \u201cI remember I talked to her that night at prom, after she tried to pull you up on stage. She told me she was only trying to help, and \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Trying to help\u2019? Yeah, right,\u201d Lucy snapped, an ember of anger appearing in her amber eyes. I heard the faintest trace of that old fire in her words coming through. \u201cThe way she kept talking shit about Naser when he was the one really trying to help \u2013 I pretty much let her run my life for years because I thought she was so smart, but she was just even stupider and nastier than I was. And that day she said to me \u2018I think you might be non-binary\u2019 \u2013 that was the day everything really started going wrong. If I\u2019d never listened to her, I wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near as broken as I am now! And just think of if I\u2019d kept listening, where would I be \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said she only wanted to help,\u201d I interjected again, quieter. Thankfully, Lucy stopped to listen. \u201cAnd she said she was sorry, and that she didn\u2019t want to hurt you anymore, so she would leave you alone.\u201d\n\nLucy\u2019s eyes widened in shock. For a moment she only stared at me, jaw slack and brows furrowed as she visibly processed that. I wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d want to believe it \u2013 after prom, neither her nor I had wanted to talk about it. Back then, I\u2019d thought it might be better if she\u2019d had some time to put it behind her, just like she\u2019d wanted when she\u2019d taken a break from the band. Back then it had felt like we\u2019d finally earned our peace from Trish\u2019s machinations, but now, three-odd years later, I found myself wondering if I shouldn\u2019t have thought of what she\u2019d needed \u2013 not what she wanted.\n\nI\u2019d tried my best with what I had back then, but after all was said and done, I\u2019d still just been a dumb kid.\n\n \u201c... Well, what\u2019s it matter? Even if she didn\u2019t mean to, she still did it,\u201d Lucy finally growled, but I could hear the lack of bite in it. She wanted to be furious, but it was like she couldn\u2019t truly muster that much up. \u201cAnd I still let her. I spent months of my life acting like an emo grunge idiot or something, trying to be a rock star, making everyone hate me. And I spent years trying to make my own family hate me, cause she thought it was a good idea. Years of my life, gone just like that, Anon. Doesn\u2019t matter whether she meant it or not,\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to think like that, before I met you, Lucy.\u201d I murmured, looking down at the table ashamedly. I hadn\u2019t been the best person back then. \u201cPlease, really think about it. I honestly think talking to Trish would help you heal, Lucy.\u201d\n\nShe was silent for a long while, and when I looked up I found her with her eyes cast down just like mine had been, bearing an expression of deep consternation.  I couldn\u2019t begin to wonder what tumultuous thoughts were running through her head at that moment. The pain ran deeper than I\u2019d ever thought, and she\u2019d spent years letting it into her very core.\n\n\u201cHow do you know? What if it just makes me worse?\u201d She suddenly looked up and asked, desperation tinging her voice. \u201cI \u2013 I just don\u2019t know if I can talk about it. I don\u2019t want to talk to her, Anon. I just want to forget it all ever happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of it, Lucy? She was your friend for so long,\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, that was before she tried to fuck my whole life up, Anon,\u201d She countered with a sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to her, Anon. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should just say what you feel. It\u2019ll only get more confusing if you try to plan it out,\u201d I advised her. I had too much experience with playing conversations in my head.\n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, but...\u201d Lucy shook her head dispiritedly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say what I feel to her. I don\u2019t... I don\u2019t even really know for sure what I feel about her, to be honest, Anon. Everything she did to me... I can\u2019t just let her get away with it. Can I...?\u201d\n\nI shook my head slowly. \u201cStupid she might have been, but I don\u2019t think she ever meant to be nasty, Lucy. I think the only way to know for sure is to ask her... But we don\u2019t have to do it tonight,\u201d\n\nShe let out a heavy exhale. \u201cFuck... I don\u2019t know... These last few years I\u2019ve hated her guts, but if you\u2019re right, then I\u2019ve...\u201d\n\nI nodded. In truth I hadn\u2019t expected her to come around to the idea immediately. \u201cMaybe you should just figure it out in your head a bit first after all. Just please think about it, alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I will, don\u2019t worry about that,\u201d She said with a tiny smile, tentatively picking her utensils back up. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be stopping thinking about it that\u2019s the trick.\u201d\n\n \n\nFor the second time, I woke up in the early morning unpleasantly alone. Lucy was not in bed beside me.\n\nShocked awake, I jolted up and turned to the window where she\u2019d been last time. Just as before she stood in silhouette before the window, her back turned to me. She was quaking quietly, with only a tiny sniffling sound betraying her quiet turmoil.\n\nAs I opened my mouth to say something she shifted abruptly, stretching her left wing out, and then slowly curled it up around in front of her. Ever so slowly her hand came up towards her pristine feathers, and I realized what she was about to do.\n\n\u201cLucy?\u201d\n\nHer name left my mouth out of sheer shock and fear more than anything, but the utterance had the effect I\u2019d desired. Her wings flared out abruptly as she gasped in surprise and looked back over her shoulder at me.\n\n\u201cAnon!?\u201d\n\n\u201cLucy, what\u2019s wrong? Are you alright?\u201d I threw myself up out of bed, hurrying over to join her.\n\n\u201cNo...\u201d Her voice cracked as she forced the words up out of her throat. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2013 It hurts, Anon. It fucking hurts!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? What hurts?\u201d I looked her over as I reached her. I couldn\u2019t see anything wrong physically but she just about collapsed into my arms, now openly sobbing.\n\n\u201cMy head! Everything! I\u2019ve been trying to think but it\u2019s so hard,\u201d She cried. \u201cMy wings keep itching. I can\u2019t focus! All my feathers are itchy! I \u2013 I don\u2019t want to, I know I promised, but \u2013 but if I just pulled a few \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Lucy, please. It would only get worse,\u201d I begged her. \u201cIt might go away for a little bit, but then it would only hurt instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter that than this! It\u2019s just \u2013 all over my wings,\u201d Her breathing was fast and heavy, her sharp fingers flexing. \u201cI need to think, but I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t do anything \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Lucy. Please, it\u2019s alright...\u201d\n\nOnce again I didn\u2019t know what to say to help her. Once again I didn\u2019t know what to do. I felt utterly lost as I held her in my arms, swaying gently in a hopeless attempt to try and soothe her somewhat as she wailed. She felt frail in a way I\u2019d never known her as before as she seemingly fell apart in my arms, her whole body heaving with each wrenching sob.\n\n\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t... I know I promised...\u201d Her eyes were screwed shut as she spoke, as though ashamed of the words. \u201cI just can\u2019t get my thoughts straight. All this stuff with the church, and now Trish... I don\u2019t know what I want anymore, Anon! I wanted to forget high school, and music, and all... all that shit, but now...\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Lucy,\u201d I murmured again. I felt helpless but for repeating that. \u201cYou\u2019re doing alright,\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like it!\u201d She cried out. \u201cI feel like I was supposed to be doing something real, but now I don\u2019t think I ever will. I feel like I\u2019m just a disappointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never disappointed me, Lucy,\u201d\n\nShe drew in a great breath before slowly releasing it. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one,\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about your brother? Your parents?\u201d I pulled back to look her in the eye as I asked her, but she didn\u2019t meet my gaze. \u201cThey don\u2019t expect the world from you, Lucy. They\u2019d probably be happy if you just let yourself be happy with the things you\u2019ve done. And I would too, Lucy. You are a good person.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t I feel like it?\u201d She finally looked up at me, her amber eyes dull with despair. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can help me this time, Anon. I don\u2019t know if anyone can. I\u2019m just... broken. I\u2019m just fucked up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, not to me, you\u2019re not,\u201d I tried to reassure her as I pulled her back in close. I just wanted to remind her that I was still there for her. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before, but I still think you\u2019re the best, Lucy.\u201d\n\nThis time she leaned into me, her wings falling limp back behind her as she rested her head against my shoulder. All of a sudden it was like her energy was utterly spent.\n\n\u201cI kinda thought us getting married would fix everything,\u201d She shrugged dismally. \u201cI really just thought everything would fall into place. I thought I\u2019d be perfectly happy here like this.\u201d\n\n\u201c... Nothing\u2019s ever that easy.\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll still help you in any way I can, though, Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d She said with a wan smile. \u201cI really don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you do. You deserve even more than I can give you,\u201d I guided us back to the bed and we sat together, leaning against each other. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We don\u2019t have to rush with anything, Lucy, we can just take our time. Leave it for tomorrow and see how you feel then, alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d She said with a weak sigh. \u201cI just... I thought I could handle it. It shouldn\u2019t be that hard... I just don\u2019t want to be a burden to anyone anymore. Especially not you,\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a burden, Lucy. Don\u2019t think like that,\u201d I admonished her gently. \u201cSometimes just figuring things out is hard enough. But it\u2019s alright. Like I said, we can just wait until you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nSilence fell between us, and we stayed together for a little while quietly. The sun slowly made its morning ascent, creping up to illuminate the world outside our window. The sun\u2019s orange glow finally lent some small warmth to our room, sending a shiver through me as I finally had time to register just how cold I was. For a moment I was tempted to try and pull the covers up around us, but disturbing Lucy wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\n\nShe seemed to have calmed down at last, her breathing slow and steady against my side. The nerve-wracking start to the morning still felt worth it just to be able to share in a part of her life like this. She really did still have so much warmth to give, and I was starting to get desperate for a way to get her to realize that.\n\nI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever been broken by the world. Rather she\u2019d let pieces of herself fall by the wayside, things she didn\u2019t think she wanted anymore, or that she was better off without \u2013 but she suffered without them. And most of them, I believed, now rested with Trish. Naser had held them once, whether he\u2019d realized it or not. All those years ago, however, Lucy had once had the fortitude to sit down and reconcile with him, and in the doing take back some of what she\u2019d lost.\n\nShe would have to face Trish eventually if she really wanted to put herself back together. I had to believe she still had that fortitude within her to do it. I had to help her, if I could. And I had to believe that Trish would still feel the same way she had back then. Three and a half years ago, she\u2019d said that she was sorry, and that she only wanted Lucy to be happy \u2013 but that was three and a half years ago. A long time in which she might change her mind.\n\nEither way, I would just have to take my own advice, for now. Like I\u2019d said to her, things could be worked out in time.  A wise \u2013 if slightly over-enthusiastic \u2013 old man had told me once that the key to a successful relationship was support. I couldn\u2019t solve the issue for her, and nor could I shelter her away from it. All I could do was hold onto her and hope she would be ready to face it.\n\nEventually, her voice broke me out of my reverie.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got work today, Anon,\u201d She murmured, cracking one eye open to look up at me dolefully. \u201cWe better get up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to take the day off?\u201d I asked. I wasn\u2019t entirely sold on leaving her alone. I wanted to be there if she still needed me. \u201cWe\u2019ve both got sick days. We can just stay home and take it easy, if you like.\u201d\n\nShe looked almost scandalized. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that, Anon. It\u2019s not like school, people are depending on us to be there,\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll live without us for one day. That\u2019s what days off are for.\u201d I reminded her.\n\nFor a moment she considered, then reluctantly acquiesced. \u201cI... I guess so. That would be pretty nice...\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m going to call in then,\u201d I said, leaning in to give her a peck on the cheek before I broke away from her and stood up. \u201cWhere\u2019s your phone? I\u2019ll grab it for you while I\u2019m up.\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ll get up,\u201d I heard some of the life starting to return to her voice as she stood with me. \u201cI want some breakfast anyway. Maybe I\u2019ll just throw some nuggies in the oven...\u201d\n\n \n\nWe spent the day together lazily, sitting on the couch in front of the television and watching whatever was on. It wasn\u2019t exactly my usual idea of entertainment, but it was still the most relaxing day I\u2019d had since my return. The clouds outside darkened the sky, threatening to rain, but inside our apartment it was warm and dry as we cozied up together on the couch.\n\nI noticed Lucy\u2019s interest starting to waver as I got up to make us some sandwiches for lunch. When I came back with plates in hand, she wasn\u2019t even watching the show, just laying down and looking straight ahead.\n\n\u201cHere, Lucy,\u201d I called her attention, proffering hers toward her.\n\nShe snapped herself back to reality  and accepted it with an apologetic smile. \u201cSorry, Anon. I was just trying to think,\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d I asked. \u201cTrish?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m still just... wondering what I would even say to her,\u201d She shrugged morosely. \u201cI used to think she was my best friend... Just me and her against the world, you know? And Reed when he came along. But now, I don\u2019t even know exactly what I was to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way she pushed me around, the way she only cared about the band... The way she yelled at me... Was I ever even really her friend? Or just a tool to her? Just something she could use to make money?\u201d\n\nI found myself thinking back to that day in the principal\u2019s office, after the sabotaged presentation. For everything else I\u2019d managed to forget of that day, I still remembered clearly how distraught Trish had been before I\u2019d left. \u201c... I don\u2019t know for sure, Lucy. But I think she was trying to be your friend. She just didn\u2019t know how.\u201d\n\nLucy was silent for a moment as she considered that. \u201cI just really thought she had it figured out. I thought she had a plan, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah... But she was just a dumb kid, like the rest of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cDumber,\u201d Lucy shook her head. \u201cAnd I trusted her with so much. I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s my fault or hers, do you know what I mean...? I don\u2019t even know if it was wrong of me to do that. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d start talking to her, because I don\u2019t know how much I did wrong...\u201d\n\nShe hauled herself up and started eating as I sat down next to her. Her bites were decidedly larger than mine \u2013 I\u2019d taken precautions against this, however, and made her two sandwiches instead of one.\n\nI was about to speak up when she continued.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, I did do wrong, though. It\u2019s as simple as that. I let myself get taken in. Even if she didn\u2019t mean to control me, I couldn\u2019t even stand up and tell her no. And eventually, I let myself get to the point I didn\u2019t even realize what she was doing anymore.\u201d She gave another slow shake of her head, her gaze falling dispiritedly down to her plate. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to talk to her again, Anon. I don\u2019t know if I want to hear what she might say... because I\u2019m scared I might fall for it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re stronger now, Lucy. Stronger than you think,\u201d I reminded her gently. \u201cI think, even if she really did just want to hurt you, you\u2019d be able to walk away. Look at you. You have your own life now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI...\u201d She heaved a great sigh, looking distractedly ahead at the television. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done that good with my life, Anon. I\u2019ve just gotten by. Barely.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven so, that\u2019s more than a lot of people can manage sometimes. You can be proud of that if nothing else,\u201d Even now I wondered what might have become of me if I hadn\u2019t realized where I was heading that year. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019ve still got a lot more to give in your life, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d She turned a nervous look to me. \u201cWhat makes you think that? I don\u2019t know what you see in me, Anon. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve got anything in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see a lot of things, Lucy. I see how you\u2019ve done your very best \u2013 and done pretty well \u2013 no matter how hard it\u2019s gotten.\u201d I said seriously. \u201cI see someone who cared for me when I still wasn\u2019t even sure if I cared for me. Someone who\u2019s a really rare kind of person, someone who\u2019s worth caring for. Someone who really can make it, who really can go places if she wants to.\u201d\n\nDisquiet only settled deeper and deeper onto her face as I spoke, her lip trembling even as she tried to keep her gaze stoic. Almost on impulse I put my plate aside and shuffled over on the couch to draw her into a tight hug.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so scared, Anon,\u201d She whispered into my ear. \u201cI\u2019m so scared of falling apart again. I\u2019ve already wasted so much of my life. I couldn\u2019t do all that again. Not again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be alright,\u201d I murmured  quietly. \u201cI\u2019m completely sure of that. You\u2019re way tougher than you think.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know that for sure. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m tough enough...\u201d She clung to me desperately, wrapping her wings up around us in a big, feathery cocoon. \u201cI\u2019ve tried so hard to forget about how bad everything went in that last year, but it always keeps coming back no matter how much I want it to go away. I\u2019ve tried to remember those good times I had with Trish, like you said, but the only thing I keep thinking of is lunchtimes, in the auditorium \u2013 and then I always remember when she started yelling...\u201d\n\nI remembered that, too. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Lucy. That shit she said \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was right about one thing.\u201d Lucy\u2019s tiny voice cut through mine. \u201cI am a nobody. I\u2019ve got nobody... Except you. You, and mom and dad, and Naser... But I know I can trust you. You and my family, you\u2019re the only ones who haven\u2019t tried to screw me up. Or... or just done it without even realizing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not nothing, Lucy. You\u2019re not a nobody, and even if you were \u2013\u201d The thought made my stomach churn. I didn\u2019t even want to entertain it. \u201cEven if you were, you can always be more, Lucy. Don\u2019t look at yourself like that. You\u2019re a good person. You always have been.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, Anon. I want to be, but... I just don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d She said glumly.\n\n\u201cI do. I know you can.\u201d I insisted.\n\nShe gave me a small glance before looking away with an almost embarrassed-looking smile. \u201cI\u2019ll try to, Anon. All that stuff you said... I don\u2019t feel like I have any of that in me. But I\u2019ll try.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I love about you. You always try,\u201d\n\nAnd she had, ever since I\u2019d met her. No matter how hard things had been for her, she\u2019d given it her best shot. She hadn\u2019t always succeeded, or walked away unscathed \u2013 Prom night came to mind. But she\u2019d tried hard, and she\u2019d made it this far.\n\nWe turned our attention back to the screen, and slowly the relaxed ambience we\u2019d had before returned to the room. Even so, I couldn\u2019t keep my mind from running about some of the things she\u2019d said as we cuddled up closer on the couch.\n\nI couldn\u2019t remember a whole lot of what I\u2019d heard Trish say to her that day I\u2019d foolishly agreed to Reed\u2019s proposal to meet, but Lucy evidently hadn\u2019t forgotten a word. \u2018I\u2019ve got nobody, but I know I can trust you\u2019. That stuck in my mind. The way she said it so plainly, so matter-of-factly, as though it was something she\u2019d just accepted and now held as truth. Did she really view other people so fearfully now? Had Trish scarred her so badly that she now simply couldn\u2019t believe that anyone who got close might really want to help her?\n\nIt was possible. Maybe even probable. They\u2019d been friends for so many years before I\u2019d met her. Maybe retreating inwards and hiding from the world had been the only way she could cope with the betrayal. Distancing yourself from the pain was a good way to reduce its suffering. I\u2019d ran away just like that before, but it had never actually helped me in the long run, and it clearly hadn\u2019t helped Lucy.\n\nI had to hope that what Trish had done wasn\u2019t truly a betrayal \u2013 that she had just been misguided, not malicious. I didn\u2019t really like her, I\u2019d say that plainly. I\u2019d never really gotten her figured out before I graduated, but I didn\u2019t think she was a bad person.\n\nI really hoped she wasn\u2019t a bad person.\n\nI took my eyes off the show I wasn\u2019t watching to look over at Lucy. She seemed like she was doing alright now, as peaceful as we had been before lunch. She met my gaze.\n\n\u201cI love you, Anon.\u201d She whispered quietly, a gentle shine in her eyes.\n\n\u201cI love you too, Lucy.\u201d\n\nMy phone chose that time to ruin the moment, ringing its chime out abruptly. I cursed it even as I checked the screen to see who was calling. It was a number I didn\u2019t recognize. My brows furrowed as I tried to think \u2013 I wasn\u2019t sure who\u2019d be calling me in lunch hours on a workday, especially when I wasn\u2019t actually there.\n\n\u201cHold that thought, Lucy. I better take this.\u201d I said as I extricated myself from her arms and hauled myself up off the couch.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nI made my way out of the apartment, taking just a moment to appreciate how much colder it was outside before I hit answer.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d A vaguely familiar woman\u2019s voice came from the other end. I couldn\u2019t immediately place who it was; she sounded young, but oddly weathered and bitter, as though she\u2019d been tired so long that had started to outright become her personality.. \u201cUh... This Anon?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered curiously. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u201c... It\u2019s Trish. From high school,\u201d She said hesitantly. I almost dropped the phone in shock. Her voice was near unrecognizable. And how the hell had she gotten my number? \u201c... How\u2019ve you been, skinnie?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2013 You \u2013 Trish?\u201d I couldn\u2019t lie, she had me completely disarmed. \u201cHow did you...\u201d\n\nI had expected it to be difficult to find her, just going off of how obstinate she used to be. Surely she would have made herself impossible to find, that was just the kind of thing she\u2019d do \u2013 Yet here she was, ringing me out of the blue, right after I\u2019d been talking about her no less. Speak of the devil and she will appear, I suppose.\n\nI wasn\u2019t mad about the presentation thing anymore, not really. I\u2019d had a lot worse shit than that happen to me over the years, these days I could just laugh off a couple of dumb cringy pictures. Besides which, I was pretty sure everyone had forgotten about that shit by now \u2013 except Stella anyway. But I could still remember the sheer disdain Trish had for me back then. I\u2019d heard her screaming it out at the top of her lungs that day Reed had held me back in the auditorium.\n\nShe was the one calling me, though, so surely she\u2019d have left it behind by now... Right?\n\n \u201c... get your number? Stella gave me it. She rang me out of the blue, the other day... Said you wanted to talk to me about Fang,\u201d Trish said, then went silent for a moment. \u201cSorry. Lucy, that is. About Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I \u2013\u201d\n\nShe cut over me. \u201cHow\u2019s she going? Is she doing alright?\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure exactly how much I should say. It wasn\u2019t right to talk about Lucy behind her back, especially with someone she might not want to hear it. But at the same time, I could hear a slight note of urgent concern in Trish\u2019s voice, genuine enough that I could believe it.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s... not doing so well lately,\u201d I said guardedly. \u201cThat\u2019s actually the reason I was looking for you. I think you can help her. Do you still want to?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d She answered instantly. \u201cYeah, absolutely. Of course I do. What does she need?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you remember what happened on prom night?\u201d\n\n\u201c... Yeah. I don\u2019t really fucking want to remember prom night, but yeah, I do.\u201d She answered, bitterness returning full force. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nI swallowed before I answered. \u201cLook... She doesn\u2019t say it, but I can tell she regrets how it all went down with you, especially after that night. She misses you Trish, you and Reed, and I think she needs your help. Do you regret \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cCourse I fucking do! What kind of question is that?\u201d She snapped. \u201cI was just trying to help. I said that to you.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2013 then I think she needs to hear you say that.\u201d I explained carefully. \u201cYou remember how I said maybe we could sort all this shit out another day, right...?\u201d\n\nHer response was a long time coming, but a lot less heated when it did. \u201cYeah. Do you want to meet up somewhere, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot today, but yes,\u201d I clarified hastily. I couldn\u2019t just spring this on Lucy like that. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her. Can I call you back on this number?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, just make sure you leave a message if I don\u2019t answer and I\u2019ll hit you back. I got my phone on silent pretty often.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll talk to you soon, Trish.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope so, skinnie, cause I miss her too,\u201d She said. I was about to hang up when she piped up again, sounding much more hesitant. \u201cHey, look, Anon... I, um... I know I never really apologized for that shit I did with the projector that day. I... I shouldn\u2019t have done that, alright? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nIn spite of myself, some part of me had to know. \u201cWhy did you do it, Trish?\u201d\n\n\u201c... Everything just started changing when you came on the scene, you know? I thought you were a bad guy. I thought you deserved it. But... I fucked up.\u201d She said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\n\u201c... Don\u2019t worry about it, Trish. It\u2019s alright.\u201d I thought I\u2019d put it all behind me already, but it still warmed my heart to hear. She wasn\u2019t the bitch I\u2019d been afraid of \u2013 it gave me hope that just maybe this meeting would turn out okay.\n\n\u201cAlright. I just... I just feel bad, is all.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnyway. Hit me back soon. Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoon as I can, Trish. See you.\u201d\n\nI hung up and leaned against the wall for a second as I collected myself. Honestly, it was as though a weight on my shoulder had started to lift. The end of the tunnel  was in sight, and there was light ahead.\n\nI made my way back into the apartment quietly. Lucy looked up as I entered.\n\n\u201cWho was it, Anon?\u201d She asked with a quiet yawn.\n\n \u201cIt was...\u201d Again I hesitated. It was about to be another unpleasant conversation, but I knew better than to try and hide her away from the truth. \u201cWell, you\u2019re probably not going to believe who that was, Lucy. Let me sit down...\u201d\n\n \n\nThe next morning, I was relieved to not wake up alone in bed. I turned my head to find Lucy still next to me, looking up at the roof. She bore a pensive expression, bordering on troubled, but she didn\u2019t seem too stressed by whatever was on her mind. Not that it was hard to guess what that was.\n\nA small smile graced her face as she looked over and found me awake as well. \u201cMorning, Anon.\u201d\n\n\u201cMorning, Lucy.\u201d I mumbled with as much clarity as I could muster at that early point in the day. \u201cSleep alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, actually,\u201d She said with a gentle exhale. \u201cI was just thinking, and I realized you\u2019re definitely right about something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right that I can take it. Whatever she\u2019s got, I can take it. I won\u2019t let myself break down again, like I did before.\u201d She gave a determined, assuring nod, but the nervous exhale she expelled told a more troubling story. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what I want to say, but I do know I want to hear what she says, so you know what? If you call her and tell her I want to meet up, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will?\u201d I asked, taken aback by her sudden drive.\n\n\u201cYeah, I will. That last year... That\u2019s not the Trish I remember at all. I need to know why she changed, what the hell happened with her. I need to know... exactly how much of it all was my fault,\u201d She reached out gave my hand a firm squeeze. \u201cIf she tries to pull anything again, I\u2019ll just walk away \u2013 and that will be the end of it. I\u2019ll let her go.\u201d\n\nThe thought sent a spike of dread down my spine. I knew in my gut that if it came to that, it would not go over well. It would be rough weeks \u2013 or months, or years \u2013 ahead. For all that I loved her, the road she\u2019d gone down these last few years was testament to the fact that she wasn\u2019t very good at letting go like that, and even if she was, it wouldn\u2019t do her good to just let go of her best friend for good.\n\nBut I had to have faith in her. I called Trish as soon as we got up with Lucy\u2019s answer, and to my surprise she actually picked up. She sounded tired and disgruntled at first, but she had trouble keeping her excitement out of her voice as we\u2019d hashed out a plan to meet up that evening at Dino-Moe\u2019s. The same place they\u2019d held their first \u2013 and last \u2013 successful concert.\n\nWork passed in a distracted blur. I wasn\u2019t even really sure what I did that day. I just couldn\u2019t keep my mind off the impending meeting. Worst case scenarios played out in my head over and over, competing for space against the hope that things could and would be okay. In my mind I heard\n\nI shared in Lucy\u2019s nervousness as we drove to Moe\u2019s old pizzeria. I still thought of it as that, even if he no longer owned the place. It felt almost nostalgic as I pulled up out the front, the inviting light of the restaurant brought me back to that happy night as though it hadn\u2019t been nearly three and a half years. It seemed a lot quieter than back then, though \u2013 I could only see a few patrons inside.\n\nLucy kept a tight grip on my hand as we made our way over to the building. As we approached the front window she stopped and held me back for a moment. I glanced back to see her scanning through the window intently.\n\n\u201cThere she is,\u201d She breathed.\n\nI followed her gaze. Trish was sitting alone at a table near the back corner of the restaurant, an untouched appetizer in front of her. She looked to be somewhat on edge, her gaze intense but focused on nothing in particular as she drummed her fingers on the table. She didn\u2019t quite look as tired as she\u2019d sounded on the phone, but she definitely didn\u2019t give the impression of the energetic, hair-trigger girl I remembered anymore. She was a little taller than I remember her, but only a little. She\u2019d ditched the ever-present yellow hoodie in favour of a navy blue jacket, but she still had the same old dreadlocks.\n\nMy immediate impression was that she\u2019d changed \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t sure how much.\n\nLucy seemed transfixed for a moment, her gaze inscrutable as she stared silently at her old friend through the window. Finally, though, with a deep breath and a heavy exhale, she pulled her eyes away. A resolute look was set on her face as she motioned towards the door.\n\n\u201cCome on, Anon. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThe bell chimed out as we pushed open the door, immediately prompting Trish to look up and see us. For a split second her eyes lit up as she saw Lucy, but the very next moment the expression of consternation returned.\n\n\u201cHey! Hey, Lucy! Anon! It\u2019s been so long!\u201d She looked as though she wanted to jump up and meet us halfway, but had to restrain herself. \u201cHow have you guys been going?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, Trish. Doing alright, I suppose.\u201d I said non-committally. \u201cHow about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot too bad! Been real busy the last few weeks,\u201d She replied with a visibly forced smile. \u201cHow about you, Lucy?\u201d\n\nLucy held her silence for a second before she answered. \u201c... I\u2019m alright, Trish. It\u2019s... It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s great to see you guys doing alright!\u201d Trish beamed. \u201cWhat have you both been up to all this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cI joined the army not long after school. I\u2019ve been deployed overseas the last few years,\u201d I stepped up to answer when Lucy seemed to hesitate.\n\nFor a moment the surprise on Trish\u2019s face was actually genuine. \u201cWow, really? Huh, I wouldn\u2019t have seen that coming. No wonder you got so jacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cArmy life tends to do that,\u201d I remarked with a half shrug.\n\n\u201cNo joke,\u201d She said. \u201c... What was it like? Was it bad?\u201d\n\n\u201cI made it back in one piece. Let\u2019s just leave it at that,\u201d I shook my head. Even if I\u2019d actually wanted to remember all that, this wasn\u2019t the time.\n\nTrish took the hint. \u201cDamn. Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re alright at least, skinnie.\u201d\n\nShe turned her eyes to Lucy then, with an inviting smile and a curious little tilt of her head. Lucy answered with a small smile of her own as she proffered her hand toward her. Trish\u2019s eyes scanned back and forth across it a few times, uncomprehending until I stretched my own hand out as well. As she took in the two wedding rings on our fingers, her eyes just about popped out of her head.\n\n\u201cOh! Oh, damn! You guys... You guys got married!?\u201d Trish gasped. \u201cShit \u2013 I mean, damn! Congratulations! Anon, you didn\u2019t even mention that on the phone!\u201d\n\n\u201cWanted it to be a surprise,\u201d I smiled and reached out to clasp Lucy\u2019s hand in mine. Inwardly I was glad Trish hadn\u2019t reacted adversely to the news. \u201cWe tied the knot a few months after I got back.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn. Congratulations...\u201d She said again. She bore a smile of her own, but even as I watched it was quickly falling apart. As she looked at our rings, her face fell steadily into dismay, then into outright misery, as though her whole world had just fell apart in front of her. \u201cI, ah, I... I... I gotta say...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I asked, suddenly concerned for where this was going.\n\n\u201cI... I just want to say...\u201d She gulped and looked down at the table, abruptly bringing one hand up to prop her head up. The veneer of happy, casual confidence she\u2019d borne thus far had disappeared completely, and all of a sudden she just looked like a miserable wreck. \u201cI just... I\u2019m so sorry, Lucy!\u201d\n\nLucy was visibly caught off guard. She opened her mouth to say something, but Trish kept going with a quick breath.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I should have been there, I should have been there at your wedding for you, but I wasn\u2019t and it\u2019s all because I was a fucking terrible friend,\u201d She choked up, audibly keeping herself from sobbing. \u201cI wasn\u2019t at your wedding and I can\u2019t even fucking blame you. Lucy, I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d\n\n\u201cTrish, I...\u201d Lucy\u2019s voice was conflicted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for how I treated you, for all that stupid shit I did. You were my only real friend back then, Fang, I was so scared of losing you!\u201d Trish cried out. Lucy cringed slightly at the mention of her old name, but she didn\u2019t speak up. \u201cAnd \u2013 And I didn\u2019t want Naser or Anon to help you, cause I thought I could do it. I thought if you had them, you wouldn\u2019t need me anymore! Nobody else ever liked me like you did back when we were kids! You were my only friend, and I wanted to help you, but if you didn\u2019t need my help...\u201d\n\nShe had her head buried in her hands now, unable to so much as look at either one of us, quaking as repressed emotion escaped her. It occurred to me then that Lucy hadn\u2019t been  the only one suffering from old wounds those three years, that she hadn\u2019t been the only one whose life had been terribly changed that semester.\n\n\u201c... then I\u2019d be useless.\u201d Trish\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cI just wanted to help you. I didn\u2019t want to lose you... I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d\n\n\u201cTrish, I have to ask,\u201d Lucy spoke softly, but surprisingly firmly. Trish looked up with watery eyes at the sound of her voice. \u201cThat stuff with my family and Anon. With Naser. Why... Why\u2019d you do all that? The way you treated them, the way you got me to treat them... that was so cruel.\u201d\n\nAgain her face fell into her hands. \u201cI know, but... every time I thought about it back then... Every time, I just remembered that time when you told me... when you told me you hated yourself. And that\u2019s all I could ever remember! I thought it was all worth it if you had a new you that you could love, and... I thought everyone else would just pull you back to the old you, the you you hated. I only wanted to help you, but I didn\u2019t realize... I just didn\u2019t want to think... that you might not need me anymore. So I aimed bigger, I came up with big plans. I just thought we\u2019d be famous, we\u2019d be famous together, and I could show you how great you really truly are...\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for her. The worst part was that from a warped perspective, all of it made sense. I could see exactly how she\u2019d gone wrong. All the horrible things she\u2019d said and the devious shit she\u2019d pulled \u2013 she\u2019d gotten caught up in her own schemes, trapped in a hooked net she hadn\u2019t even realized she\u2019d been making, the wounds from which still bled both of them today. She hadn\u2019t even realized how badly she was hurting Lucy, or herself.\n\nShe\u2019d tried her best with what she had back then, but after all was said and done, she\u2019d been nothing but a dumb kid.\n\n \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve thought of it, I\u2019ve thought of how fucked up I was. I was so desperate for you to need me, that I thought it would be okay if you didn\u2019t need anybody else. I thought I could make it all work. I thought I could turn your life around all on my own. I... I thought I had to, \u2018cause nobody else could,\u201d Tears of open regret flowed freely down Trish\u2019s face now as she made her confession. \u201cBut I was wrong. I was wrong about everything. I was so stupid, and controlling, and I made you hate me \u2018cause I was a fucking idiot, but Fang, I didn\u2019t mean to. I know I don\u2019t deserve to be your friend anymore, but I just had to tell you... I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to fuck it all up like I did. I just wanted to help you.\u201d\n\nI could see Lucy\u2019s eyes glistening as her gaze fell to the table. Hell, I had to admit I could feel the waterworks starting unbidden in my own eyes. Again I had to wonder if this was a discussion that should have happened a long, long time ago.\n\n\u201cTrish...\u201d Lucy murmured in a nervous, tremulous voice. \u201cTrish, all this time I wasn\u2019t even sure if you were ever my friend. I thought you were trying to trick me into something, but I couldn\u2019t ever figure out why you would do that. You really... never hated me...?\n\n\u201cNo! Never!\u201d Trish shook her head emphatically, a stray tear flitting off her face. \u201cI just thought if I planned a little better, if I was a little smarter, it would all pay off. We\u2019d all work hard, and we\u2019d be famous, and everyone would love us, and we\u2019d all be happy. But everything started falling apart, and I just thought I had to work even harder because I was too scared and stupid to fucking think! I never meant \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cTrish \u2013 It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nLucy surprised us both with those three words, and for a moment silence reigned at the table. She had a look on her face that I\u2019d only ever seen once before, in all my time with her, on the roof of Volcano High. A look of quiet, grateful revelation. A look that might well have opened up the world before her, like she\u2019d suddenly found the answer to a question that had haunted her forever.\n\nShe looked up and met Trish\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Trish.\u201d Lucy repeated gently, the words escaping her almost like a sigh of relief. \u201cI should have realized you weren\u2019t really like that. We were friends so long, and I still thought you just changed instead of trying to talk to you...\u201d\n\n\u201cWha \u2013 Don\u2019t apologize, you idiot! Why are you apologizing, when I\u2019m the one who nearly fucked your life up?\u201d\n\nThe both of them stood up almost simultaneously,making their ways around the table in step. Lucy put her hands on Trish\u2019s short little shoulders, looking down with a careful, examining gaze \u2013 and then, I\u2019ll swear the very next moment they were embracing, sobbing into each other\u2019s arms, Trish blubbering wildly and Lucy faring little better.\n\n\u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry I yelled at you, I\u2019m sorry I said all that shit, I\u2019m sorry I ruined the band, I\u2019m sorry for prom night \u2013\u201d\n\n Lucy said nothing, only held onto her oldest friend, the pair of them swaying together as their outpouring overcame them. I could swear I felt my heart lightening as I looked on, sheer relief overtaking me as I practically saw the years of turmoil falling away from both of them. It wasn\u2019t as bad as I\u2019d feared after all. Maybe it never had been. Maybe it didn\u2019t need to have gone on like this for as long as it had. Maybe this painful path hadn\u2019t needed to be walked for this long.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t matter anymore. It was going to be alright.\n\nLucy caught my eye and waved me in towards them with one hand. Her voice quavered as she tried to laugh. \u201cCome on, Anon. You come here too. Group hug. It\u2019s about time you two kissed and made up.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod. Anon, I really am sorry,\u201d Trish turned to me with a rueful look. \u201cThose stupid pictures, that stuff I said about you... I shouldn\u2019t have. I\u2019m sorry. I fucked up. I had you figured out wrong. I had everything figured out wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Trish. Don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d I waved her off with a little smile. I joined their little circle against the world with an arm linked around them both, following Trish\u2019s lead in leaning on Lucy\u2019s shoulder. I didn\u2019t care who in the restaurant might be looking at that point. \u201cEveryone\u2019s forgotten about it by now anyway. Except Stella... She remembers,\u201d\n\nTrish gave a choked-up laugh. \u201cOf course she would. That weirdo, with her animes and stuff...\u201d\n\n\u201cI... I think I had you figured out wrong too. I used to think you just hated me, that you were just... I don\u2019t know. A bad person.\u201d I said somberly. \u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was. I really was, back then.\u201d She mourned. \u201cNeither of you deserved all that shit I gave you. I got so caught up in my own bullshit, I forgot what being a friend is actually meant to be about. I fucked up so bad, you guys...\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Trish. Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s all in the past now, right?\u201d\n\nShe looked up, her gaze flicking between Lucy and I, before a small smile finally spread across her face. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Lucy chimed in, a genuine smile on her tear-stained face.\n\nWe split back apart again, Trish looking up at us both with a hopeful expression.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starved. You guys \u2013 You guys want to get something to eat? Since we\u2019re here? We can catch up a bit. I\u2019ll shout,\u201d\n\nEven holding back tears, she sounded so much more like the Trish I remembered.\n\nLucy spoke for us both as we nodded in unison. \u201cSure, Trish. Do you know if they still do the Meateor Special here?\u201d\n\n \n\nWe made our way back into our apartment in better cheer than I remember being in a long time. Lucy finally seemed utterly relaxed, that beautiful serene expression I\u2019d only seen on her face while she was asleep now finally gracing her waking hours. She leaned against me as made our way up the stairs, but not for support \u2013 solely for proximity. She moved now as though a weight had been taken off her shoulders, at peace with the world at last.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we went, Anon,\u201d She murmured, flicking the light on as we crossed the threshold to our little home. \u201cI\u2019m glad you talked me into it. In hindsight, it feels so stupid... I can\u2019t believe I would have run away from Trish forever over that. I got myself so worked up, but... she was just scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople do all kinds of things when they\u2019re scared,\u201d I said in concurrence.\n\n\u201cThat they do.\u201d She agreed quietly. \u201cI... I\u2019ve been scared all this time. I didn\u2019t want to see her, because I thought she\u2019d just hurt me again. But... I shouldn\u2019t have been. I should have known better than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up, Lucy,\u201d I reassured her. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. We made it here alright. That\u2019s what counts the most.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d She said with a rueful laugh. \u201cJust... makes me feel dumb, is all. Me and her, we were both scared of nothing in the end, and it nearly fucked us both up big time.\u201d\n\nLucy split away from me, heading over to the closet where we kept the few things we hadn\u2019t unpacked yet. I followed in her footsteps as she pulled it open, and carefully extracted...\n\n... her old guitar. The instrument that she once hadn\u2019t been able to give any excuse not to bring, now held happily again in her capable hands.\n\n\u201cLucy...\u201d I whispered, struck by what it meant.\n\n\u201cI wonder if she\u2019d ever want to play again. Like old times...\u201d Her whisper was just barely audible, but the gleam in her eye was plain to see as she turned back around to face me. \u201cAnon, you remember our song, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t ever forget, Lucy.\u201d That song had been pretty much the only thing keeping me going at some points.\n\n\u201cI want to play it,\u201d She said breathlessly, looking up at me with an exhilarated smile. \u201cJust... bear with me for a bit, alright? I gotta try and get back in gear first.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I laughed.\n\nLucy plucked away at the strings as we relocated to the bedroom and sat down together on our bed. Just as she had with the church organ, she spent a few minutes at practice, strumming through melodies as she reacquainted herself with the strings she\u2019d used to hold dear. I tried to follow her motions with my eyes \u2013 she\u2019d taught me a lot about playing guitar, but even out of practice as she called herself, I wasn\u2019t anywhere near her level.\n\nFinally she seemed satisfied, letting her last note hang for a moment before giving a light chuckle. \u201cAlright. Let\u2019s just see how I go, here.\u201d\n\nShe began slowly, gently, quietly strumming the song into the air with a never-forgotten artist\u2019s ease. In an instant I was taken away, and the rest of the world ceased to exist. The steady, peaceful motions of her hands and the intent focus in her eyes were the most beautiful contrast I\u2019d ever seen in the world as she brought back times I\u2019d thought I might only ever visit again in my memories. It was like those three years apart hadn\u2019t passed. It was like we were still there, in her room, sitting together as we composed this song. At this very moment it was the pinnacle of everything we shared together. She poured her soul into it as she moved from bar to well-remembered bar, her careful motions allowing the music to fill the room with its quiet, reflective tone.\n\nEverything we\u2019d gone through together was in that song. If she\u2019d looked up she might have seen my very soul bare on display, just as much as hers was \u2013 but the music was her entire world in that moment, exactly as it was mine.\n\nShe\u2019d suffered in her silence. In her fear she\u2019d muted herself, deprived herself of an undeniable part of her \u2013 but now, this melancholy rendition of our song was offered up as a testament to who she truly was, no matter the years lost.\n\nShe\u2019d changed. She\u2019d endured. She\u2019d grown.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crying, Anon.\u201d Her voice pulled me out of my reverie.\n\nI looked up away from the guitar at last.I hadn\u2019t even noticed she\u2019d stopped playing \u2013 the melody still echoed in my head, pulling me away back to simpler times. Her own eyes were glistening wet, a shaky smile on her face.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just raining,\u201d I sniffed. \u201cHeh. Hey, Fang. How\u2019ve you been?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t call me that, Anon,\u201d She gave a hiccuping laugh, before shaking her head quickly. \u201cGod, you don\u2019t want me to be Fang again, do you? I was so... so edgy back then,\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you...\u201d I grasped her by the shoulders, looking firmly into her glistening amber eyes, \u201c... to be happy with exactly who you are, and what you do. I don\u2019t want you to leave any part of you behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just... I was so stupid back then...\u201d She sniffed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I let things get like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, Lucy. We were all stupid. I still loved you then. I still love you now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all of us. You weren\u2019t.\u201d She said with a little smile.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I was any smarter than you. Just... I dunno. Really lucky, I guess,\u201d I murmured and pulled her into a hug. The guitar was set aside as she wrapped her wings tightly around me. I always felt like the world was a million miles away when she did this. \u201cWell, I must have been. I met you, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be so goddamn cheesy,\u201d She said with another short laugh before she breathed out, audibly struggling to keep from choking up. \u201cIt\u2019s just so stupid... I never felt like it was mine, this guitar. Ever since that day, it was Trish\u2019s. I just thought... it was what she wanted out of me. All she wanted out of me, you know? The music. But I didn\u2019t want to give it to her anymore. That\u2019s why I wanted to put it away.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she was just as dumb as us. Didn\u2019t know how to say what she really wanted,\u201d I whispered. I felt Lucy\u2019s heart beating as we embraced, strong and sure in spite of this precious, fleeting state of being.\n\n\u201cAnd neither did I,\u201d Lucy shook her head and sobbed. \u201cI\u2019ve been so stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lucy. We\u2019ll be alright now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah... You\u2019re right. We will,\u201d She said, a firmness in her voice even as it wavered. \u201cI\u2019m going to do better from now on, Anon. No more falling apart like I did after school. No more being afraid. I want to be the best person I can, and I want to make you happy like you\u2019ve made me happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already do that every day, Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop being so sappy, god damn,\u201d She shoved me with a weak laugh. \u201cI\u2019m trying to have a moment here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Lucy, alright then \u2013\u201d I struggled for a moment to think of something. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll help you be the best person you can, in any way I can. I promise I\u2019ll make you exactly as happy as you want to make me. How\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect. Thank you,\u201d She whispered. \u201cFor everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Lucy,\u201d I pulled back for a moment to look at the woman who\u2019d pulled me out of my shell at last. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThought I said to stop being sappy.\u201d She said with a snort of laughter.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re one to talk, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I pointed out, unable to keep a smile from creeping across my own face as well.\n\nShe considered for a moment before laughing again. \u201cYeah. I guess I am.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t bother to get back up, to get changed out of our clothes, or even to put the guitar back. We fell back onto the bed and we fell asleep that night exactly where we were, exactly as we were, cuddled up together on top of the blankets.\n\nThe ceiling light was still on, but it wasn\u2019t a bother to us. We didn\u2019t even notice. The light Lucy and I shared between us was bright enough to match it.\n\nWe had each other.\n\n\n\nThe sound of gentle strumming and the smell of cooking food hit me as I opened the door, immediately setting me at ease as I stepped into the apartment. Every other day since we met Trish a week or so ago, I\u2019d come home to the pleasant sound of Lucy playing her guitar. One time I\u2019d managed to sneak in quietly enough that she hadn\u2019t even noticed, wrapped up in her jam session as she was. I\u2019d sat there and listened for a good few minutes until she\u2019d finally looked up and noticed me.\n\nThis time however she heard me enter, immediately breaking off from her song and giving me a warm smile.\n\n\u201cHey, Anon! There you are!\u201d Lucy stretched and ruffled her wings as she stood up off the couch, still holding her guitar in one hand. \u201cLate again, I see. Gonna have to dock your pay if you keep this up,\u201d\n\nWe shared a quick peck on the cheek. \u201cHey. Sorry, Lucy. It\u2019s this event still... You wouldn\u2019t believe how much paperwork there is just to get a spot at a college expo organized.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot sure I\u2019d want to, either,\u201d She said with a good-humoured snicker as she put her guitar away on its metal stand. She\u2019d gone out and bought it a few days ago, just so she could have her instrument on display in the living room. \u201cI was just getting in some practice while I waited for dinner to finish cooking... It should be just about ready by now, I think. I thought we\u2019d have a nice little potato bake tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds good to me. Your cooking\u2019s always the best, Lucy.\u201d It wasn\u2019t even an exaggeration, I was practically spoiled with her around. I hung my keys up and followed her as she sauntered off into the kitchen, eagerly anticipating whatever she\u2019d made.\n\nShe picked up her phone and briefly checked something on it. \u201cOh. Nope, timer says five more minutes, actually. Sorry.\u201d\n\nDamn. I had to admit, the smell alone was quickly making me hungry. \u201cOh, well. How was your day?\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty good, actually! Trish called earlier, while I was cooking.\u201d\n\nThat caught my interest. Trish and Lucy seemed to be slowly rekindling their friendship, keeping in touch online and over the phone. I didn\u2019t know exactly what they talked about \u2013 catching up on old times and girl stuff, presumably. It wasn\u2019t any of my business, and I wasn\u2019t too worried. I doubted Trish would do anything to jeopardize the relationship she\u2019d just recently salvaged, but even so, I hoped she wouldn\u2019t go on to try and rekindle their friendship in exactly the same way they\u2019d had it before. Lucy just didn\u2019t need that kind of help anymore.\n\nI knew she was stronger now than she had been back then, just like I\u2019d said to her. I didn\u2019t think Trish would act like someone who needed handling \u2013 I really hoped she wouldn\u2019t \u2013 but if she did, Lucy could handle it. I had faith in her.\n\n\u201cYeah? What\u2019d she call about?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s been talking to Reed. Apparently they kept in touch,\u201d She explained as she started setting the table. \u201cHe\u2019s moved out of Volcaldera for his work. She says it\u2019s something pharmaceutical, she\u2019s not exactly sure what... But either way, she got him to agree to come visit at some point. What do you reckon?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be... interesting. Pharmaceutical, huh?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what to make of that. Given the stuff Reed had been into when I\u2019d known him, \u2018pharmaceutical\u2019 could mean anything under the sun. I remember him being pretty cool though, if maybe a bit too laid back. \u201cIt\u2019d be good to catch up with him, I suppose. See what he\u2019s been up to and all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah... Also, Trish is coming over for dinner.\u201d Lucy said abruptly, turning to me with a cheeky smile.\n\n\u201cOh, sounds good. When?\u201d I was a little taken aback. I hadn\u2019t expected  either of them to reconnect quite this fast, honestly.\n\nAgain she picked her phone up and checked the time. \u201cWell, she said she\u2019d be here about twenty minutes ago, so probably soon, I\u2019d hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait \u2013 She\u2019s coming tonight?\u201d\n\nI found myself somewhere between shocked and impressed. It was great that Lucy was beginning to let people back into her life, instead of only having her work and... me. Just a few short weeks ago I was worried that she\u2019d never open up again \u2013 it really felt like she had left a piece of her soul behind, that year at Volcano High. But now, she was already reaching out, making plans to meet up with friends of her own volition. Her old friend, with all the baggage they\u2019d shared, no less. She was moving past it at a phenomenal rate.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Her smile fell slightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind, right...?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not a bit, Lucy,\u201d I reassured her hastily. \u201cJust a bit surprised, is all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah... Sorry, I probably should have said something beforehand,\u201d She said sheepishly.\n\nI was about to reiterate that it was fine when Lucy\u2019s phone buzzed loudly. As she checked it, I heard an abrupt knocking at the door, but before I could so much as move a muscle she\u2019d dropped her phone down on the table and dashed past me excitedly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s her now, she just messaged me!\u201d She said exuberantly as I followed along in her wake.\n\n\u201cShe messaged you she\u2019s at the door, then knocked anyway?\u201d I asked confusedly.\n\nLucy turned and shrugged as she unlocked the door. Trish was in fact just behind it, dressed in a sharp but modest skirt and jacket. She tucked her phone back into her pocket as she greeted us with a tired smile.\n\n\u201cHey, Lucy! Sorry I\u2019m late, work was a bitch and so was traffic. Didn\u2019t even bother going home to get changed, just thought I should probably come right over,\u201d She said apologetically.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not the only one. Anon was late too,\u201d Lucy gave a smile of her own as she stood aside to let Trish in. \u201cIt\u2019s good timing, anyway, actually! Dinner will be done in a few minutes if you just hang tight.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool, I\u2019m starving like you wouldn\u2019t believe. Haven\u2019t eaten since breakfast,\u201d Trish remarked with a faux carefree air as she stepped into our little home. Her eyes fell on me as she made herself look busy inspecting the place, and she gave me a polite nod. \u201cHey, Anon. How you going?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, thanks, Trish. We\u2019ve been doing alright,\u201d I stepped aside to let Lucy past, brushing her wing with one arm as she made her way back to the kitchen and left us two to make our own conversation. \u201cA lot better lately, especially. How are you? You look like you\u2019re being run ragged.\u201d\n\n\u201cBusy as hell. Trying to expand the salon, but it\u2019s hell juggling keeping the place going and running around to offices all over town.\u201d She shook her head then gave a resigned shrug. \u201cAh, well. Work giving you hassles too, huh? ... Remind me what do you do again, sorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cRecruitment, now. Technically it\u2019s still duty, but it doesn\u2019t much feel like it,\u201d I said casually. \u201cJust been having issues getting some stuff sorted out with an event in a few weeks. Paperwork and stuff, you know,\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. I know what you mean, paperwork\u2019s been my nightmare lately,\u201d She said with a knowledgeable nod. \u201cLike, things have been going great at work, but I want to go bigger. There\u2019s a serious gap in the market around here for horn cosmetics, you know? But now I\u2019m almost thinking it\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth. All the licenses and stuff you need, it\u2019s insane...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need a loicense to paint horns now as well?\u201d Inwardly I laughed, thinking of an old joke I\u2019d shared with Lucy.\n\nTrish gave me a confused look for a moment but didn\u2019t bother to ask. \u201cNot just painting, Anon. Extensions, reshaping, hollowing, that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, what? Hollowing? Isn\u2019t that dangerous?\u201d I asked uncertainly. \u201cIt sure sounds dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the slightest! No more dangerous than nail cosmetics, and people do all kinds of crazy shit with those,\u201d Trish said insistently as she shook her head. I got the feeling she\u2019d had this conversation a bunch of times with other people already. \u201cIn some ways a horn is just a really big nail, anyway. There\u2019s a ton of room to do some creative shit with them, I swear, but most people won\u2019t even think of trying it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it sounds like you\u2019re going to have a hell of a job convincing people. From my layman's perspective, first thing I think of when I hear that is that it sounds like surgery.\u201d The sounds of dinner being plated drew me into the kitchen, with Trish following along right behind me as we talked.\n\n\u201cYou can see the other half of the issue I\u2019m having, then. No idea whatsoever about how I\u2019m gonna advertise this stuff...\u201d She groused. \u201cStill, I know I\u2019m onto something. Just have to hash it out a bit more.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I hope you can figure something out.\u201d I said sympathetically.\n\n\u201cThanks, Anon,\u201d She smiled. Her face practically lit up as she entered the kitchen. \u201cHoly shit, Lucy, this smells great! What is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a potato bake. Keeping it simple tonight,\u201d She answered, a slightly flustered flush visible from the praise.\n\n\u201cGod damn. I think I\u2019m gonna have to come around here more often,\u201d Trish marvelled, her eyes fixed covetously on the pan of fresh-baked goodness Lucy was serving up. \u201cI usually just have microwave dinners, if anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeesh, Trish, don\u2019t do that to yourself,\u201d Lucy chided. \u201cThat stuff\u2019s awful for you. It\u2019s not too hard to cook something quick up yourself, you know.\u201d\n\nThe three of us took a seat as Lucy finished dishing up with a flourish. Trish immediately picked up her knife and fork and made to dig in, but Lucy waylaid her with a slap on the hand and a sharp look.\n\n\u201cHey! We say grace before we eat in this house. Or apartment as it might be.\u201d\n\nA look of pure, devastated disappointment fell onto Trish\u2019s face as she was forced to restrain herself a moment longer. \u201cOh. Sorry. Uh... I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSomehow I managed to constrain myself to a clandestine smile. Mollified, Lucy withdrew her arm and clasped her fingers together, closing her eyes in simple reverence.\n\n\u201cDear Lord, we give thanks to you this evening for the meal we are about to eat. Amen.\u201d She picked up her knife and fork and looked over to Trish, who was still looking between us uncertainly. \u201c... You can eat now, Trish.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh thank God, for a second there I was worried you had to like, recite a whole prayer or something,\u201d As soon as she heard the word, Trish started attacking her food with gusto.\n\nI bemusedly watched her go as I picked up my own cutlery. \u201cYou sure they\u2019re not starving you, Trish?\u201d\n\n\u201cDude, like I said. I haven\u2019t had anything to eat except breakfast today,\u201d She said between mouthfuls. \u201cHad to skip lunch... This is really good, Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Trish. It really sounds like you should take some more time for yourself, though... Skipping meals and microwave dinners, that can\u2019t be healthy,\u201d Lucy said with a tone of concern.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not gonna be like this forever. I just got a fair bit going on with work,\u201d She shrugged indifferently. \u201cI don\u2019t really know anything about cooking anyway, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could teach you, if you want,\u201d Lucy offered, leaning in earnestly. \u201cWe could hang out some day and I\u2019d show you a bit. It\u2019s not too hard.\u201d\n\nTrish actually paused in her rapacious eating to consider it. I could only imagine she was wondering at the depths of how much her friend had changed over the years, because now I thought about it myself, it had to be somewhat of a shock to her. From the edgy punk rocker person she\u2019d been molded into, to the woman she was now.\n\nShe looked up to meet Lucy\u2019s eager eyes, and after a moment, a genuine smile spread across her face. \u201cYeah, sure. That\u2019d be cool.\u201d\n\nThe conversation brought up a memory to my mind. \u201cOh, that reminds me, Lucy. You remember Stella? I was talking to her the other week, she said that she and Rosa would be down to meet up for lunch or something at some point, if you wanted to catch up. What do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, might be fun. I haven\u2019t talked to either of them for a long while...\u201d She nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI wonder how they\u2019re doing these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, I got a thought,\u201d Trish piped up, pulling herself away from her already mostly cleared-out plate. \u201cIf we could get Reed in town for it, maybe we could all go out together and make it a big do. Like a little mini class reunion or something. Go out and grab some dinner somewhere, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d I nodded. It would be good to be able to catch up with everyone at the same time. \u201cWe\u2019d just have to organize a date that works for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll have to talk to Reed, I don\u2019t even really know when he\u2019s free. Also, can I grab seconds? This is really, really good.\u201d\n\nLucy gave a snort of laughter. \u201cHelp yourself, Trish. Just don\u2019t eat it all, alright?\u201d\n\nThe rest of the meal passed with amicable conversation as Trish finally slowed down enough to speak like a normal human being \u2013 or dino, as it were. The three of us talked about work, swapped stories and shot the shit like the three years of angst behind us simply hadn\u2019t happened at all. We even managed to while away another hour or two afterward chatting. Lucy laughed and smiled freely the whole while, as unreservedly happy as I\u2019d ever seen her.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that she had her friend back, so much as that she seemed to have her self back. She was still in the process of shedding the years of bitterness, but at least she was finally able to. It might be a long road yet that she had to walk, but already she\u2019d proven that she was capable of more than she thought, and that she had people beyond her immediate family who were willing to help her. She\u2019d shown herself that she didn\u2019t need to be afraid of herself, of people, of the world.  I believed that knowing that \u2013 knowing it with the certainty of truth and taking it in as a part of her, not merely being told by someone else \u2013 made a world of difference.\n\nWhen the time came that Trish finally decided to call it a night and head home, Lucy sent her off with a hug. Trish returned it nervously at first, but soon looked like she didn\u2019t want to let go, closing her eyes tightly as she held onto her.\n\n\u201cWe should do this again soon, alright Trish? I\u2019ve really missed seeing you.\u201d Lucy said softly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too, Lucy...\u201d Trish replied, her voice doleful. \u201cI really am sorry. I wish I\u2019d never \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Trish. Please.\u201d Lucy insisted as they separated again. \u201cI\u2019m doing alright now. We\u2019re all doing alright now. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah... You\u2019re right.\u201d She gave a hesitant smile. \u201cSee you later, Lucy. Bye, Anon. It was nice seeing you guys again.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame to you, Trish. See you.\u201d\n\nAs Lucy and I saw Trish off, content with an evening of good food and good company, I realized all of a sudden just how much less bleak everything had really felt lately. Looking back, my memories since my return almost felt pale to me \u2013 hopeful, but not really happy. Now, I found myself actually looking forward to tomorrow for how it would be as we had it, not for how it might be better in future.\n\nI didn\u2019t fear for Lucy anymore. I didn\u2019t need to, and she didn\u2019t need me to. It had been a dark few years, but from where we stood now, it all looked a lot brighter.","Title":"Ending 3 - Light Inside","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Stella and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Cobalt_Blue_Sphere","Summary":"She knew she was supposed to do better.

Lucy walked with her hands comedically outstretched in front of her, acting like she would find a new obstacle with every step. We were walking through the city park where we had reunited six months ago, soft twilight enveloping everything in a dim light interrupted only by the park\u2019s lamps as the twinkled on, one by one. With my face this close to Lucy, I can smell her hair, the delicate mix of coconut and orange blossoms filling my nose. In the time since I returned to Volcaldera, I had tried to fill my entire life with her, working hard to absorb as much of her as I could. Hardly a day had gone by when we didn\u2019t see each other, but picking up our relationship after such a long time away hadn\u2019t been easy: Lucy had changed, more than just what she had admitted to me that first night we were together. She seemed tense, as though she was still protecting herself from something, a feeling that I suspected only got worse when I was gone. I often caught her staring off into space when she didn\u2019t think I could see, a morose expression on her face. Seeing her in those moments would break my heart just a little bit, but ultimately only served to deepen my instinct to protect her. Tonight, however, she was all smiles, her beauty on full display even as I picked her up from her parents house. Ripley and Sam had become like another set of parents to me as well, and had done wonders to support us through the early stumbles of our relationship. Sam was especially overjoyed to hear Lucy and I had started dating again, and it seemed my time spent in the deserts during the war had done wonders to improve Ripley\u2019s opinion of me. The expression on his face when I had informed him of my plans for tonight as we waited for Lucy to get ready for our date had be priceless.  \n\n\u201cAnon, geez, can\u2019t you just tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d Lucy asks, laughing as her heel catches momentarily on something unseen on the concrete path. I had made her close her eyes a few blocks away from the park, but I could do little to hide the cool night air or the smell of the water from her. Both of us are wearing our best formal wear, Lucy resplendent in an amber-colored halter dress, a cream-colored wrap draped over her arms, a string of pearls from her mother around her neck. I had donned my old dress uniform, slightly surprised that it still fit after these months of Sam\u2019s filling Sunday church lunches. Neither the sort of thing one would usually wear when trekking across a public park late at night, but I had promised Lucy something special tonight, and I intended to make good on that promise.\n\n\u201cHey now, I said no hints! It\u2019ll spoil the surprise\u2026\u201d I whisper in her ear, feeling her body tremble slightly as I do so. I slow Lucy to a stop, careful not to press into her wings too harshly, keeping my body well back from her. My heart was beating out of my chest, now that we were so close to our destination, and I didn\u2019t want the soft pitter-patter of my heart against her wings to give away the surprise. We weren\u2019t far from the bench where we reunited, the spot I had picked out for our date this evening. In truth, that spot that would always hold a special place in my heart, and we had re-visited that park bench so many times over our relationship I was worried Lucy would recognize where we were going by feel alone. Giggling as I accidently bumped her into a trash can, Lucy moved her hands to mine, half-heartedly attempting to pull them away.\n\u201cPleeeeese? Just a little peak? I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t spoil anything\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no peeking babe!\u201d The nervousness gives my voice a slight edge as I hold my hands firmly against her eyes. Lucy immediately drops her hands, and I can feel her body tense up slightly. It\u2019s the same reaction whenever I raise my voice even a little around her, or put my foot down on an issue. But Lucy always yields, and I quickly reassure her everything is ok, hoping to dispel any unwarranted tension. \u201cPlease Lucy, just a few more steps, then you can open your eyes, okay?\u201d \n\n\u201cOkay Anon, I trust you,\u201d Lucy responds, as meek as milk. Kissing her on the top of her head, I guide her the rest of the short distance towards the bench, removing my hands from her eyes at last.   \n\n\u201cOkay, open your eyes\u2026\u201d I whisper, my hands now resting on her shoulders. Slowly, Lucy blinks her eyes open, those amber orbs drinking in the bench before her, drinking in what I had planned hours before hand. Draped across the seat of the bench is a white cloth, dozens of red camellia petals strewn over the surface. Thirty-six small candles also dotted the bench, resting on small plates and dishes I had carefully collected from Lucy\u2019s mom. Sitting in the middle of all of this was a small box, suitable only for a small piece of jewelry or other keepsake. In this case, a ring.\nGrinning, I watch Lucy\u2019s face over her shoulder, a wondering realization filled her face. Tears filled her eyes as she covered her snoot with her hands, a beaming smile already splitting her mouth. Choking back a sob, Lucy turned her face to look at me, pulling her hands away from her mouth with a shudder.\n\u201cOh, Anon, it\u2019s beautiful\u2026 The flowers, the candles\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOne for each month we were apart!\u201d I interject, too excited to keep my mouth shut. Lucy chokes back another sob, tears of unbridled joy running down her face. Smiling, I nod my head to the small box on the bench, releasing her shoulders as she steps forward, her heels clacking on the concrete. Leaning over, Lucy takes the box in a trembling hand, turning back to be with another sob as she cradles it near to her heart. \u201cGo ahead Lucy, open it.\u201d\n\nTaking a deep breath to calm herself, Lucy fans her eyes with one hand, the box held tightly in the other. She makes one final unsuccessful attempt to bite back tears before opening the box, letting out a squeal of excitement when she sees what\u2019s inside: A wedding band of simple gold, the not-insignificant diamond sparkling in the soft candle light amid its setting. Lucy\u2019s eyes momentarily diverted, I take the opportunity to get down on one knee before her, reaching my hands out to hers.\n\n\u201cLucy, will you marry me?\u201d\n","Title":"Ending 3 - Rules of Engagement","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Ending 3 - Snoot Sex.txt":{"path":["Fang","Ending 3 - Snoot Sex.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending 3 - Snoot Sex\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Smoke_Anon\n\n\nA cool night time seabreeze hits your face as the old-timey saloon door swings open. Your fianc\u00e9 grasps a proffered forearm, sticking to your side. You think back to the months preceding the here and now. Reuniting with your high-school sweetheart after a stint in the Army, helping her move out of her parents\u2019 place, finally getting on one knee to ask her the most important question of your life.\n\nIt\u2019s been just a few months since you proposed to her. She was so shocked by it that for the first several seconds she could only stare at you, a mesmerized glaze occluding her normally amber eyes. The initial deer-in-a-headlight response was less than encouraging, and you can still remember silently panicking at her reaction.\n\nShe had blinked a few times, tears rolling down her scaled cheeks in fat droplets. You remember her face lighting up in the brightest smile you\u2019d ever seen from her, rapid-fire \u201cYes!\u201ds and incoherent declarations of love gushing freely as you\u2019d embraced her. You\u2019d held her there in your arms for several minutes, the ptero blubbering tears of joy into your dress shirt. She\u2019d drawn her head back from your soaked chest and leaned up to your face, eyes closed, a gesture you readily reciprocated. Your lips touching the tip of her snout; the two of you had joined in a deep, passionate kiss, one that felt far too short once you broke it off. You remember touching your forehead to hers, catching your breath hot-and-heavy like.\n\n\u201cAll that and I haven\u2019t even put the ring on yet...\u201d you\u2019d said with a nervous chuckle, and she\u2019d given her own before sniffling, lightly swatting you on the arm and looking up at you. \u201cCame at me a little fast \u2018s all\u201d. Your hands had fallen from her lithe hips and hers from your broad back, and you\u2019d slipped the simple yet elegant silver band onto her finger. You\u2019d looked back up to meet Lucy\u2019s gaze, and that time it was you who leaned in first for a makeout session.\n\nA clawed thumb and middle finger in front of your face snap you back to the present. \u201cCar\u2019s back that way, dweeb,\u201d she says, alcohol slurring her words just enough to be noticed. She motions in the other direction with a raised brow and a smile on her snoot.\n\nYou rub at your neck and sigh. \u201cSorry Loos, got uh\u2026 Lost in thought.\u201d\n\nShe hums in acknowledgement, resting the side of her head against your arm and nuzzling against your bicep. Her four-door sedan enters view within a few minutes, and you head around to the other side to open the door for her before getting in the driver\u2019s side yourself.\nThe drive home is a relatively quiet one, the silence only broken by the occasional drunken giggle from Lucy. Halfway through the drive she closes her eyes and reclines her seat back, wrapping herself up in her feathery wings. You can\u2019t help but smile, finding yourself somewhat jealous you\u2019re not wrapped up in those very wings right now. A few minutes later you reach the road that leads to the apartment complex you\u2019d both moved into. It\u2019s a decent spot, certainly better than your old pad on Skin Row. God that place was a fucking shithole; the only time it was ever a home to you was when Lucy was there. You pull up to a vacant parking space near the vast apartment complex, making sure to ride the brakes as gently as you can so as not to disturb the sleeping dino next to you. After putting the car in park, you quietly get out and shuffle to her side. You bend down and slip your arms under her back and legs to pick her up in a bridal carry, still very careful not to disturb her sleep. All the while she still has herself swathed up in her wings. If you\u2019d tried this maneuver when you were eighteen you probably would\u2019ve thrown your scrawny-ass back out.\n\nWith a brisk, steady pace you get home within a few minutes. She isn\u2019t all that heavy; some would go so far as to say it\u2019s like she\u2019s made of feathers. You chuckle at your own joke and she begins to stir a little at the noise. It seems even in her sleep this girl hates your lame wisecracking. Once you reach the apartment door a realization hits you: She has the keys.\n\nYou sit in silent contemplation for a good few minutes. Only when your arm starts to ache does an idea hit you. Very, very gently, you begin adjusting her farther up your forearm, hooking your wrist around her thigh to try and get access to her pocket. With your hand at the precipice of its goal, you look up to gauge her expression, finding that same small smile still plastered on her blissful sleeping face. You snake your hand into her jean pocket, fishing around for purchase before finally finding the key-loop. Bingo! You insert the key into the door handle, twisting it and swinging the door open.\n\nThe scent of fresh-baked cookies wafts over you and you can\u2019t help but smile at the pleasant welcome. Another one of Lucy\u2019s great ideas paying off it seems; putting some vanilla extract in a coffee cup then popping it in the oven really does make a home smell amazing. And judging by the stirring from sleeping beauty, it seems someone\u2019s waking up. You glance down to see Lucy\u2019s open maw in a yawn, rows of her razor-sharp teeth out on full display. \u201cMmmm\u2026Smells good in here.\u201d she says groggily.\n\n\u201cMhm. \u2018Nother one of your ingenious ideas paying dividends,'' you snark; a half-sarcastic tone creeping into your voice. She giggles at that and unfurls one of her wings just enough to smack you in the face. You start to put her down, but are met with resistance as she shifts in your arms and looses a disapproving whine.\n\n\u201cNuh-uh, you\u2019re carrying me to bed like this, mister.\u201d The will to please your lady outweighs the complaints raised by your aching muscles, and you soldier on past the living room to the bedroom. Pulling the same maneuver from earlier, you turn the knob and use your foot to nudge the door open.\n\nThe room before you is a bit spartan verging on bland, but pleasant memories lining the walls in framed photographs save it from utter austerity. You walk to the bedside and lay your fianc\u00e9 down on the queen-sized mattress, but before you can pull away Lucy suddenly unswathes herself from her wings and uses the surprisingly powerful appendages to force you into her outstretched arms. She rolls over with you in her grasp, pinning you down against the soft sheets. Just as you open your mouth to protest, you find her snout up against your lips in a fiery kiss.\n\nHer tongue forces its way into your mouth and begins dancing around your own, the faint yet unmistakable taste of alcohol following it everywhere it touches. For the first few seconds you find yourself completely dumbfounded while she performs her heart out for you. As things settle, though, you begin to reciprocate and lean into the kiss. You go back and forth with her, getting increasingly more domineering with it. She lets out some noise caught in between a moan and a gasp when you push your tongue back against her, forcing hers out and delving deep into her own mouth. As deep as you can go with your relatively short muscle, anyway.\n\nShe breaks off the kiss before you do, catching her breath like she had just run an olympic mile. \u201cYou must be as pent up as I am\u2026\u201d she says in a low, breathy tone.\n\nYou don\u2019t bother responding with words, finding yourself wholly starved and craving an intimacy you hadn\u2019t shared with her in far too long. Leaning in, you begin lavishing small kisses across her long snoot, starting next to her nostrils and ending right down next to the edges of her mouth.\n\nShe lets out a randy giggle and starts to push away from you in an attempt to escape your relentless smooching.\n\nNow\u2019s your chance!\n\nYou use her momentary preoccupation to your advantage, grabbing the surprised pterosaur by the shoulders and flipping her onto her back. Her face is initially one of shock, but it melts away into bliss when you start sucking on her neck like Nosferatu.\n\nThe temptation to rush into lovemaking is nearly overwhelming, but your desire to make this a memorable experience tempers your lust.\n\nYou\u2019re going to give this girl a show.\n\nA wicked smile tugs at the corners of your mouth and you wordlessly start to unbutton your shirt. Stripping at the pace you\u2019re going is serving as quite the tease for the girl beneath you; Lucy squirms and lets out small coos and satisfied noises for each article of clothing you remove. Stripped down to nothing but your underwear, you begin to help Lucy disrobe, peeling off her blouse to reveal delicate sweat-slicken scales and soft feathers. A glance cast down to her cherry-red bra gives you a mischievous thought.\n\nYou dip down to her bust, take your middle finger and thumb to the clasp of her bra, and snap your fingers. Just like that, the under-garment containing her modesty slacks and loosens allowing you full access to her breasts. Lucy\u2019s now bare chest heaves in anticipation of your next move, the soft moonlight gracing you with the visage of her small but perky breasts, the flesh of her areola and nipples a dark shade of blue. Her eyes dart from your chest down to the erection tenting your briefs and the sound of fabric rubbing together draws your attention directly behind you. Looking over your shoulder confirms your suspicions as you see her thighs twisting around almost of their own volition.\n\n\u201cOh G-God, Anon...Please\u2026I can fucking smell you...\u201d She stammers in a heady tone\n\nYour dick throbs at this declaration and your smaller head deems all foreplay concluded. You start leaving chaste but passionate kisses down her lithe frame starting at her clavicle and ending at her navel before dipping your fingers inside the waistband of her jeans and panties, swiftly pulling down in one fluid motion.\n\nA satisfied groan escapes from the back of Lucy\u2019s throat as the cool air helps alleviate the blast furnace coming from between her legs. The dark blue color of her lower lips matches that of her breasts and you find yourself staring at her unique sex in a fond familiarity.\n\n\u201cDweeb\u201d Lucy says in an irritated huff, resting her hand atop your head before forcing you down in between her thighs with a surprising amount of strength.\n\nA staggered moan escapes Lucy as your lips make contact with her dripping cunny, thighs tightening around your skull, your nose jammed up against her pubic feathers. The heat and spicy aroma of her aroused sex quickens your heartbeat and you can\u2019t help but to begin licking away at her.\n\nYour tongue starts in long slow strokes from bottom to top, each time making her moan raise in pitch. To her credit, Lucy was doing more than just sitting there lamely as she began rolling her hips against your eager tongue, spreading her nectar across your face and down your chin. Lucy\u2019s taste begins to drive you mad with desire and you find yourself plunging your tongue into her depths in an attempt for more of it. Your pussy-gobbling zeal earns you muffled but pleasured moans and encouraging tail thwaps against the mattress\n\nEventually the supple flesh of her thighs tighten like a vice on either side of your skull and begin to tremble in a sign of a rapidly approaching orgasm, an orgasm that you were going to make explosive. You make it a point to look Lucy dead in the eye as you swap your gentle ministrations to crazed tongue-lashing. Puckering your lips, you take her pearl in your mouth and start madly polishing it with the tip of your tongue.\n\nAnd with that her dam broke.\n\nThe sound of fabric tearing reaches your ears through her thin legs though it proves to be an afterthought as a wave of feminine juices hits your face. Lucy thrashes wildly about on the bed making noises you didn\u2019t know she could make, all the while you dutifully continued licking away at her spasming cunt; by the end of it you were on the verge of unconsciousness from lack of oxygen. Once Lucy\u2019s legs relinquish your head you pull back and take a second to catch your breath, each one you take in tasting of Lucy\u2019s tangy essence.\n\nLucy sits laying on the mattress in post-orgasmic bliss, dopey grin on her snoot, legs shamelessly spread exposing her glistening navy-colored petals. Your erection aches at the sight of this.\n\nYou wordlessly strip out of your briefs and your cock springs free to the cool air. Lucy looks over to you and her head casts downwards to your unrestrained manhood. Her eyes glance upwards to focus on yours and a look of unmistakable lust is in them. Without skipping a beat, you move in between her legs and rest your glans against her entrance, maintaining eye as you make one fluid thrust of your hips.\n\nHer sex envelopes your member into her velvety folds and the both of you moan in unison. Lucy\u2019s tightness was something not all that unexpected...But this...This was something else. You start at a slow but steady pace, still gauging the previously fragile girl you had reunited with a few months prior. She hisses through her teeth as you pull out, and lets out a drawn-out groan when your member fills up her passage again. \u201c...Faster, Anon.\u201d she coos\n\nYou\u2019re more than happy to oblige. You pick up the pace with a firm, steady rhythm, falling into it with ease. Each thrust is met with the sound of scales on flesh and a breathy moan from Lucy. You crane down from your midsection and dig your face into her neck, suckling and kissing her neckflesh leaving bright-red hickies; it\u2019s a stark contrast from the rest of her aqua scales. Lucy\u2019s legs wrap around your waist and both of your hands move to find the other\u2019s, intertwining your fingers in a lovingly firm grip. You can feel her walls start to twitch and clamp erratically around your cock, trying desperately to coax a load from you. \u201cI-I\u2019m close, Anon...Don-Don\u2019t stop\u201d she moans. You angle your hips and begin thrusting into her with a hastened pace. Her moaning turned to begging: pleads of \u201cMore\u201d, or repeating \u201cPlease\u201d over and over again. One last thrust sends Lucy the edge, a long drawn out \u201cYes\u201d accentuating her peak and the inner walls of her vagina clamp almost painfully around on your dick.\n\nLucy spends the next several minutes of her post-orgasm high raking her nails across your broad back in lazy circles, humming to herself the song you wrote together. A dull ache radiating from your crotch brings you out of the pleasant moment as your once rapidly approaching orgasm simmers down to a bad case of blue balls. With a grunt, you withdraw from her depths, cock standing tall and slick with her feminine juices. Lucy takes great notice of this, and she looks up at you with an impish look on her long face.\n\n\u201cNot done yet, are you?\u201d she asks in a rhetorical manner, flipping onto her stomach and sticking her pert rump high in the air with her stubby tail wagging to and fro.\n\nNeedless to say, you\u2019re on her in a second.\n\nYou plunge yourself back into her with fervor and Lucy practically screams in response to your sudden onslaught, literally biting the pillow and grabbing the sheets as she holds on for dear life. You lean over her trembling frame burying your head face against her plush wings neatly tucked against her back and wrap your arms around her torso, groping her tits and pinching her diamond-hard teats.\n\nFrom this angle you manage to stroke against her g-spot with every thrust. Her lips cling to your shaft jealousy as your cock pulls backwards before clenching down invitingly after each thrust, over and over again. The familiar sensation of a coil beginning to tightly wind was beginning to form in the pit of your stomach, and with every thrust it grew tighter. Lucy could feel your dick begin to throb, the prospect of your splooge in her guts proved quite the incentive as she began meeting your thrusts with her own. The feeling of a rapidly approaching orgasm was strong, but another sensation starts niggling in the back of your head; through the lustful haze of it all your inner voice calls to you. At first it\u2019s drowned out by the lurid slaps of your hips slamming together and cries of ecstasy, but it gradually raises in volume until it\u2019s all you can hear:\n\n\u201cTUG. THE. TAIL\u201d\n\nYou lean back and sit up straight, your hand moves almost out of its own volition and you find it firmly planted against the base of her tail.\nRaptor Jesus, please forgive me for the sin I am about to commit. With a tightened grip around the stubby appendage, you yank on it. Hard.\n\nLucy lets loose an ear-shattering scream of pure rapture, her pussy clamps down around you in waves so hard you have to actively push back to avoid being squeezed out. The not-so-gentle ministrations cause the coil in your stomach to come unwound explosively as you cum harder than you\u2019ve ever cummed before, blasting her navy insides a brilliant ivory with your seed.\n\nA groan comes from Lucy as you withdraw from her battered box and you collapse next to her. As soon as you hit the sheets, Lucy is already swathing you up with her wings in a cocoon of feathers. The next few minutes before succumbing to sleep is spent whispering sweet nothings and exchanging chaste but meaningful kisses.\n\nLucy may not have been the same woman you left when those three long years ago, but she\u2019s the one you\u2019ve come to learn and fall for over these past several months. She\u2019s the woman you were ready to spend the rest of your life with, and the woman you\u2019d be there for, no matter what.","Title":"Ending 3 - Snoot Sex","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Smoke_Anon"},"Ending 4 - Reconnecting.txt":{"path":["Fang","Ending 4 - Reconnecting.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending 4 - Reconnecting\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: Semi-NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nEnding 4 \u2013 Reconnecting\n\nA summer breeze whipped through the quiet streets of Volcaldera, the wind providing some relief from the stifling temperature. Even as the sun completed its descent behind the bluff on the edge of town it was hot as balls, and I once again loosen the tie around my neck. Fang and I had just finished out dinner date at a fancy restaurant, but the hot summer night is making me regret suggesting we walk home rather than catching a cab. Fang herself seems unaffected by the heat, idly humming a tune as her tail wags in rhythm, her hand caught in mine. The amber pendant I had given her all those years ago hangs in the low neck of her dress, catching the final rays on the sun beautifully. I can\u2019t help but stare at her, smiling gently at just how wonderful she is. I had only just returned to Volcaldera last week, and already we were inseparable, just like before. \n\n\u201cAre you going to stare at me all night, dweeb?\u201d Fang interrupts my thoughts with a soft jab to the ribs, snapping me out of my reverie. I can see the faint blush still remaining on her face, evidence that I had been staring none to discreetly for some time now. \u201cWeren\u2019t we going back to your place?\u201d\n\nSmiling again, I give her hand a squeeze. \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm with a guy staring at his girlfriend, huh?\u201d Girlfriend. That word feels nice on my lips after all these years being apart. Sure, I visited Volcaldera when I could find the money too, but never for more than a week or so, the joyous occasion always tainted by the bitter knowledge that I would have to leave Fang again. We avoided the couple label then, finding it made our break easier. But now I was back, and I had no intention of leaving Fang again.\n\n\u201cOi, got a loicence fer starin\u2019 then, luv?\u201d Fang\u2019s British accent had not improved in the intervening years, but it made me laugh regardless. \u201cSeriously though, how far is your new place? I\u2019m dying out here.\u201d Fang beat her long eyelashes exaggeratedly, a little pout emphasizing her mock distress. \u201cIt\u2019s like, a hundred out here Anon, how can you stand that tie?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I thought dinos were supposed to like the heat\u201d, I retorted, pointing towards where my new apartment sat on the corner of the block. Luckily I was able to escape Skin Row this time around, my sound engineering degree paying off nicely, and I managed to land a nice upscale standalone apartment on the edge of downtown, not too far away from Fang\u2019s. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s just over there. I still can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t help me move in, how lazy are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey! I had to do that field trip, remember? To the museum? I made it clear that it was going to cost you one whole bag of dino-nuggies, and someone failed to deliver!\u201d Fang emphasizes her point with another soft jab in my ribs, the blow softened by how she never broke our hand-hold. Her voice dropped as her amber eyes darting up and down the empty block. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s more fun to see it for the first time now, Anon. I really am dying out here.\u201d Her voice was breathy, needy, full of unsaid promises that could only be confirmed when we were together alone. As Fang stared up at me with lidded eyes, it finally dawned on me why she was so needy: It was estrus season. I had been away for so long, been able to only visit in certain months of the year that I had forgotten when her time of the year was. Suddenly, memories of the last time Fang and I had been together for an estrus season came rushing back, the heat blossoming across my face having nothing to do with the setting sun. \n\n\u201cAh, well, that\u2019s, uh\u2026\u201d It was all I could do to stumble out something, anything, that resembled speech, as all the blood in my head made a mass exodus to a place a little further south. I was suddenly very glad that the streets were empty, trying to nonchalantly adjust the bulge that was growing in my jeans. Fang shifted her hand out of mine and into the small of my back, her claws tracing a delicate pattern through the thin fabric. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Anon, ptero got your tongue?\u201d Fang\u2019s words were pure honey as she moved her wing around my shoulder, forcing me to lean down towards her. Still walking, Fang extended her long tongue, lazily flicking my ear before briefly tracing the inner folds. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2026 cuddled, Anon,\u201d she said with a purr, her hand moving down to squeeze my ass. \u201cWhat are you waiting for, dweeb, let me in\u2026\u201d I was surprised to find that we were at the door to my apartment, my brain having decided that it had more important things to do than remember the intervening distance. \n\n\u201cAh, oh, yeah, sure! L-let me get the keys, and\u2026\u201d My hands moved in slow motion, the silver keys drawn to the lock as if by a magnet, however they worked. Fang\u2019s hands were all over me now, her earlier apprehension for passers-by proving a weak defense against the ranging torrent of hormones currently flowing her thick, powerful veins. The key penetrated the lock slowly, taking a complete and total pleasure of the experience as it entered the lock. The metallic sound of the mechanism was lost to me as Fang attacked my ear once more, moaning in anticipation. Something was wrong, however; even as I twisted the door handle like a madman, the door refused to budge, disallowing any entry like some sort of thick wooden chastity device. \n\n\u201cDoor\u2026stuck\u2026\u201d I mumbled, trying it once more as Fang\u2019s hands explored even lower on my body. I dared not turn my gaze away from the dull surface of the door, for fear that catching even a glimpse of Fang as she was right now would send me over the edge. Every available bit of blood seemed to be rushing to my mounting erection at this point, and my mouth seemed to have forgotten how words were formed. Sweat poured down my forehead, stinging my eyes. Never in my life did had I thought I would end up cockblocked by a door. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you have to turn the key, dweeb. See, like this\u2026\u201d Fang\u2019s honeyed words sounded far away as her hand crawled down mine, taking the key between two fingers and twisting, slowly. Tumblers shifted as the key rotated in the lock, forcing the door to yield its defense against our entry. Finally, the key could turn no more, and Fang rested her hand on mine, the other turning my head to face her. Fang\u2019s amber eyes shimmered in the fading light, seemingly burning with some sort of inner brightness as they drilled into mine. Her mouth was open, and I could hear her ragged breaths as she panted like the animal in heat that she was. Curiously, her breath was clouding in the air despite the heat, probably another consequence of my brain shutting down. Fang continued our gaze a moment more before twisting the door handle, guiding my hand to do the same. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got five estrus seasons to make up for, Anon.\u201d \n\nStop penis, I can only get so erect. \n","Title":"Ending 4 - Reconnecting","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Ending... 2.txt":{"path":["Fang","Ending... 2.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending... 2?\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nThe cig you\u2019re smoking is now but a stump as you make your way back to your dingy apartment, ready to settle in and indulge in the rest of your cardboard tasting pizza while watching TV, maybe catch some dubbed anime, and laugh at the awful localization. Spitting out the now useless cancer stick, you step on it to put out the remaining embers, grinding it against the concrete for good measure, and continue your way home.\n\nExcept your feet don\u2019t move from there.\n\nThis small, common action, had your mind thinking back on Fang again, reminding you of that time you ditched Naser and Naomi under the pretense of looking for a bathroom, to instead look for, that time you two shared a smoke, and sneaked away from the couple straight for Little Troodon.\n\nAnd soon, your mind diverges back to the Fang you encountered back at the pizza place, a former shadow of her former self, wasting her incredible talent doing small musical gigs, barely scraping by, with a group far from having the technical and musical abilities of Trish and Reed, a couple of junky looking band mates, rotting her life away.\n\nLike you sait it, she\u2019s smart, talented, and unlike you, Fang had all the pieces in place to rise into a music star. She has to know what she\u2019s doing, this has got to be what she wants, right? That means you have nothing else to do with her anymore, you two burned your bridges years ago on that beach, and chose your lives accordingly.\n\nYet, why does it hurt so much to have seen her like that? That miserable state, and vacant look in her eyes; it only makes you feel more miserable yourself. Do you still have feelings for her? You thought you were over this, but clearly you\u2019re not.\n\n\u2026\n\nFuck\n\nYou have to see her, at least talk to her one last time, even when it inevitably ends in her shouting in your face about how you ruined her life, and the many ways she\u2019s gonna rip your heart apart, and end in how she truly, utterly hates you, so you can end this chapter of your life story behind with no regrets.\n\nYou need at least this closure in your life.\n\nPivoting on your foot, do you a one eighty over the cig you\u2019ve just stepped on, and power walks your way back to the pizzeria, on the way there you pass through a homeless dino man and uncaringly drop the pizza boxes onto his lap, you\u2019ve lost your appetite anyway.\n\nOnce back inside the pizza joint, the first thing you notice are the lights being on this time around, illuminating the entirety of the interior, which can only mean one thing, the show\u2019s over. Looking over to the corner where the stage is set up reveals nothing but the pulled sideways curtains, no instruments, no band, and no Fang. Shit... turning towards the counter, the same guy who packed your pizza is there cleaning the glass cups with a stained towel, you\u2019re glad you didn\u2019t ask for anything to drink, and that you didn\u2019t eat too much of that pizza.\n\nThat poor hobo.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d You call him out, getting the dino man to look at you, an eyebrow rising, not expecting you to come back, of course.\n\n\u201cBack so quickly? What, fell in love with my pizza?\u201d He tries to joke, guffawing at the idea, but you\u2019re not really in the mood for jokes right now.\n\n\u201cIt tasted like shit, gave it to a hobo\u201d the man clearly didn\u2019t enjoy having his food insulted if his annoyed sneer was anything to go by, but you could care less \u201cI came here because I wanna know if there\u2019s some staff room for the people who use the stage\u201d\n\n\u201cTch, fucking ingrate child\u201d A click of his tongue and a huff is all the response you get.\n\n\u201cI still paid for that shitty pizza, you got nothing to be mad about. Now, my question?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, sure whatever, there is a staff room in the back past that door\u201d He points the a single door right besides the stage, partially hidden by the elevated stage itself \u201c\n\n\u201cThanks\u201d bitch.\n\nWith the answers you wanted, you leave the annoyed man and make a beeline for the door placed right by the stage. It\u2019s a heavy metal door, rusted with age and use. Pushing past it reveals a small, derelict l hallway, walls covered in cheap looking rotten and peeling off hexagonal patterned wallpaper, with a couple of old wooden doors flanking the pathway, probably toilets, and lit by a single, hanging tube light, blinking on and off, ready to go out permanently soon, if not cause a short circuit and leave the whole building in flames..\n\nOne of these doors leads to the staff room, where Fang is.\n\nDo you really wanna do this? \n\nYou try asking yourself, but your body automatically moves toward your objective for you as your mind tries coming up with an answer for that, and before you know it, you\u2019re in front of an old, disgusting wooden door with a cheap plastic sign plaque hanging from a nail; \u201cstaff room\u201d written on it in permanent marker. It looks to be in such a bad shape that any force above a push applied to it could probably atomize the whole thing.\n\nSo, tap it you do, lightly knocking on the door with your knuckles, you wait for the impending shitstorm. Hopefully, Fang won\u2019t remember you, you\u2019ll say hi, she\u2019ll look at you like you\u2019re just another person, say hi back, and you can go on with your life. No one answers the door, you humor the idea of just leaving, but you know you\u2019ll regret not at least talking to her one last time, so you knock on the door again, a bit harder than before.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, coming dude...\u201d comes from the other side, a muffled male stoner\u2019s voice, must be this band\u2019s Reed, only twice as high and probably ten times dumber.\n\nThe door opens enough to reveal a shirtless raptor with a green mohawk and pants sagging sideways, showing a piece of his underwear, much to your disgust. You\u2019ve seen him on the stage with Fang, the drummer if you remember correctly. He looked at you with the droopy, baggy eyes of someone who inhales drugs in higher quantities than he breathed air, and only slept one hour a day, and it reflected in his state, skinny arms and torso, with visible ribs poking from under his scales, you could flick his arm and it\u2019d break.\n\n\u201cWhat you want, dude?\u201d He asks in that typical junkie slur, god he\u2019s like Reed on steroids, did Fang just replace her friends with worse versions of them? Anyway, what do you say? You don\u2019t even know if Fang still goes by Fang, or if she\u2019s going with another name? Is she still using the pronouns? Better keep it simple and avoid saying anything that might set any of them off in case they\u2019re anywhere like Trish used to be.\n\n\u201cI was in the audience for your music number\u201d You reveal to him, making his droopy, stoner eyes widen.\n\n\u201cOh.., you were?\u201d He interrupts you, his voice pitch rising in expectation, they probably don\u2019t get a lot of praise, because what you heard definitely wasn\u2019t good, the music fucking sucked \u201cPretty cool right?\u201d he asks, clearly waiting for a positive answer out of you.\n\n\u201cYeah, sure\u201d you humor him a sorta praise  \u201cAnyway, I recognized your bass player, used to go to high school with me, wanted to say hi\u201d better not call her a her, or a they, in front of these guys, don\u2019t know if she\u2019s still into the pronoun thing.\n\n\u201cNo joke? You know Fang?\u201d so she\u2019s still going by Fang?\n\n\u201cYup, we used to know one another, but I lost contact\u201d more like you used to be a couple, fucked up everything, and isolated yourself from everyone out of depression until high school ended, and you had to go navy, or go homeless.\n\n\u201cAlright dude, just a sec\u201d he simply turns his head, looking over his shoulders \u201cAY YO FANG, THIS SKINNY DUDE HERE WANTS TO SAY HI, SAYS HE KNOWS YOU!\u201d\n\n*Cough \u2026. cough*\n\n\u201cArgh... what?\u201d  That was most definitely her voice, although ragged and throaty, most likely from the years of drug use, it comes out as a rough slur, much like that of the raptor screaming his lungs out in front of you, only much less, well, slurry.\n\n\u201cI SAID THERE\u2019S A SKINNY HERE WHO WANNA SEE YOU!\u201d Uber Reed screams again, louder this time. You really wish you could shut him the hell up, but it could compromise your objective here.\n\n\u201cA skinny? Eh, whatever, let him in, I guess\u201d Fang\u2019s voice nonchalantly answers him back, and he turns to face you.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon in dude\u201d he opens the door wider and stands aside to let you in. Stepping into the staff room, the smell of burning weed instantly invades your nostrils and almost makes you sneeze on the spot, you haven\u2019t smoked some in years, not after you got in the Navy as a pact seaman, that place essentially detoxed you with all the work you had to put up with.\n\nIn there you\u2019re met with their current crashing place, a windowless square of a room. Floor invisible to the naked eye, covered in smoke, most likely from the weed they\u2019ve been smoking nonstop. There\u2019s a fan on the ceiling, but it\u2019s not on, and probably just straight up broken. Walls you assume were once white, or at least a bright color are stained green from mold due to lack of ventilation. Across the room there\u2019s an L shaped sofa on the corner, made of beat up leather, with cracks and tears all over, stained foam poking out of them.\n\nIn the middle of the room is a square, short legged table filled with all assortments of shit, from junk food, to beer, whiskey, and of course, drugs, lots of them, you\u2019re pretty sure of it. These guys aren\u2019t the least bit worried that you might just call the cops on them for ownning and consuming all this shit which you bet your ass is illegal, probably because they\u2019re high as a kite to even fathom that possibility, like the almost dead fuck by the corner.\n\nOn the corner of the room one of those long neck dinos, a brontosaurus you think they\u2019re called, conked the fuck out, splayed over the L shaped sofa, his bloodshot eyes wide open, and lips apart just enough for a blunt to fit. If you didn\u2019t know any better you\u2019d assume that guy was dead from how unfocused his eyes were staring unblinkingly at the ceiling, but the miniscule rise and fall of his chest sell out his state of living, he might be in a self induced coma from overdose, who knows, that\u2019s not who you\u2019re here for however. Turning your eyes left to the armchair close to the table.\n\nSitting on a beat up leather armchair, smoking a blunt while leaning forward to cut some cocaine with a razor blade over the stainless steel table is none other than Fang herself.\n\nHer amber eyes are still as dead as they were back in the stage,  she doesn\u2019t even bother looking up from the drug she cuts into neat lines, too busy getting them all ready to get sniffed through the straw laying right by their side. Now that you\u2019re closer you can see the finer details of her current self. Dark gray makeup painted over her upper eyelids, instead of the bright orange and purple she used to apply, black symbols tattooed on her shoulders and hands, of what you don\u2019t know, could be the band\u2019s logo, or some cultist shit.\n\nOn her long beak, black lipstick drawn in the shape of human lips that she doesn\u2019t have, no longer a spiked bracelet wrapped around her head fin, in it\u2019s place a dirty grey bandage. The once tight black shirt she wore, now replaced with a baggier tank top. No more choker on her neck, and her pterodactyl skull pendant replaced by a bunch of tribal looking necklaces.\n\nJust looking at her like this hurts, before you left you couldn\u2019t quite see how she had changed, but now that you see, it feels like your heart\u2019s getting stabbed multiple times, each for every different detail you notice is for the worse, because you know it\u2019s all partially, if not entirely, your fault..\n\nWalking further into the room, you stop right by the table, across your ex. For a moment you just stand there, unable to say anything, only stare at the miserable girl in front of you, prepping to go into a comatose state like her collegue in that sofa with how many coke lines she\u2019s sorting out. Her head moves up ever so slightly, eyes following after, from your spot it looks like she\u2019s eying your legs, one hand leaves her side and takes the cig between her fingers, blowing smoke from her lips and nostrils.\n\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re just gonna stand there?\u201d her voice is monotone, no feelings or emotion behind it, a far cry from the voice you heard in high school, full of anger and attitude, yet also full of life and maybe hope \u201cI thought you wanted to talk, if you have nothing to say, just get out and leave me alone\u201d and places the cigarette back and takes a drag, firing smoke through her nostrils this time, and looks back down to chop the coke into dust. You take a deep breath and speak what could be the start of a shouting match.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it, Fang?\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d her coke chopping stops just an inch from the drug, from where you stand you can see one eyebrow raising in confusion, before her head starts angling upwards \u201cWhat? How do you know my na-\u201d\n\nAnd the cigarette falls from her parted lips.\n\nHer two hollow eyes widen as soon as they set sight onto your face. Recognition shines deep within those faded orbs. Her lips part in shock as for the first time in years she looks straight into your own eyes as you stand there, not even four feet in front of her. Her rough and ragged mouth breathing from years of abusing her throat and lungs come out of her shaking lips, trying to find words to say.\n\n\u201cY-you\u2026\u201d she manages to stutter out \u201cYou...\u201d her voice rises ever so slightly, her hand clenches around the blade she\u2019s been holding. Blood drips from her closed fist, the razor having been driven into her skin, but that doesn't seem to be affecting her at all, too overdosed on the sudden fury bubbling inside to notice any pain. That got the attention of the shirtless stoner not-Reed, however, who rubbed his chin while pointing to her bleeding hand.\n\n\u201cUmm, Fang, you\u2019re bleeding onto th-\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, Trent!\u201d Trent, as you now know him, flinches and shuts up instantly, almost shrinking under the commanding tone her voice took, she didn\u2019t even look at him, only ever staring at you with her now very much alive, and very much livid, eyes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Fang seethes through clenched teeth \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The tone of her voice tells you to pick your words wisely, but you\u2019re more than certain whatever you say or do will only make her even more pissed.\n\n\u201cI saw you performing earlier, and came to talk\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t wanna talk to you!\u201d she snarls, every word laced with excessives amounts of poison.\n\n\u201cFang ple-\u201d\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T!-\u201d she screeches, throwing an arm forward, pointing her bony, bloody finger at you. She notices her stained hand, and unclenches it to find a razor blade lodged right in the middle of her palm. She unflinchingly pulls the blade out, the increased blood flow of the now open wound pooling onto the table.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that\u2026\u201d the blade is chucked across the room, bouncing against the moldy wall with a metallic ping  \u201cOnly my friends get to call me Fang\u201d she warns you, giving a side glance to the awkwardly standing... Trevor was it? And the comatose guy \u201cJust go. Away\u201d venom like no other you\u2019ve ever heard and felt continues to seep out of her lips.\n\n\u201cThen where are Trish, and Reed?\u201d your question unintentionally attacks her heart like a searing knife, making her visibly flinch and cringe, like you\u2019ve physically assaulted her. She spoke of friends, but you don\u2019t see either of her highschool trio, you\u2019d expect they\u2019d stick to her with how close they used to be.\n\n\u201cWhat about them?\u2026\u201d she holds her bloodied hand up to her chest, over her heart, gripping her wrist with the other, letting the crimson liquid flow down her hand and forearm. The way it bled almost looked like a wound had been ripped open in her chest instead, one that you just might have from her reaction.\n\n\u201cI thought you three were gonna become music stars\u201d at least that was the impression, the band had a lot of potential, and talent to spare, but they didn\u2019t choose that career path? Her eyes gain a pained look, highlighting the dark, heavy bags she carried around, aging her face a couple of years older than she actually is, before she shuts her eyes tight and shakes her head, banishing whatever thoughts residing in there.\n\n\u201cTrish and Reed left me after highschool\u201d she confessed, still holding her hand over her heart, now clenched tight \u201cThey just gave up on the band and left me all by myself\u201d her eyes snap open and glare pointedly at you \u201cLike you!\u201d it\u2019s now your turn to grimace, your ex is showing no hesitation in voicing aloud the distaste she feels for you.\n\nThat\u2019s what she says to you, but something about the way she says it, you don\u2019t think Fang\u2019s being completely sincere, only telling you half truths. You might\u2019ve not been an active operative, but the years you spent in the navy taught and trained you in many things, one of them was hearing when someone wasn\u2019t being fully honest \n\n\u201cI have new friends now, friends that don\u2019t abandon me\u201d yet, she doesn\u2019t even bother motioning to them, not even a side glance in their direction this time, these two might as well be strangers to her. \u201cAnd I have a band as well, I don\u2019t need Trish or Reed, I never needed them, they were just holding me back from following my dream!\u201d\n\n\u201cI get to play my music in many venues, I make money, I have returning clients. These guys?\u201d her hand motions toward the establishment in general, and you guess others as well \u201cThey all call ME to perform in their restaurants, and bars, that\u2019s how good I am. I don\u2019t need to go looking for venues like back when I hung around Trish and Reed\u201d her words sound strained, like just saying those things were a struggle. It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s trying to convince herself more than she\u2019s trying to convince you..\n\n\u201cI see\u201d you take a moment to side glance the people she calls friends, that Troy guy is slowly trudging to the L couch, having given up on just standing there, waiting for something to happen like an idiot, and sitting on top of the not-dead bronto guy\u2019s legs. He sluggishly pulls out a joint, and spends a good many seconds trying to light up his lighter, with no success; despite calling them friends, that guy doesn\u2019 seem very interested in the situation taking place in front of him, preferring instead to let a stranger interact with his band mate while he tries to get high, good friend.\n\n\u201cNow do me a favor and get out!\u201d glancing back towards Fang, whose face has gotten increasingly more aggressive looking, you decide. No, you don\u2019t think you will.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting out before you hear what I have to say, then, then I\u2019ll go\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and what is it?\u201d she huffs, face contorting into something between a sneer and a smirk \u201cGonna call me mentally ill again?\u201d you grimace again, vivid memories of the time you openly insulted her over what she identified as at the beach, definitely your lowest moment, lower than even being outed as a weeb and humiliated in front of both schools you went to.\n\n\u201cA schizzo? You wouldn\u2019t even make a passable faggot, was it??\u201d her words drip with condescending sarcasm, there\u2019s not a day you don\u2019t regret saying those things to her, maybe if you kept your mouth shut back then, but you were young and stupid, being considerate wasn\u2019t even a thing \u201cJust an atention seeker, right?\u201d her teeth gritted in her ever bubbling rage.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, do it, say it again, that\u2019s what you wanna do, eh? Rub it in this loser's face how much of a failure she is, RIGHT?\u201d your eyes widened in shock at the revelation, to which she quickly took notice.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, SHE\u201d The bloodied right hand she clutched close to her chest by the wrist is let go to reveal nothing, no colored band wrapped around \u201cLook here\u201d she seeths between her teeth \u201dNo more stupid band, and nothing here too\u201d she lifts her other malnourished hand, again no enbie wrist band \u201cThat's what you wanted right, a girlfriend instead of whatever the fuck I wanted to be?\u201d You close your eyes and take a deep breath, whatever you say right now, will only result in blowback, probably the biggest backlash you\u2019ll get from her \u201cYou never fucking cared for who I was, did you?\u201d no\u2026 that\u2019s not it \u201cProbably just saw me as some pretty face you wanted to get lucky with\u201d that\u2019s not true, you loved her, you just never truly appreciated her until she was gone from your life.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, do it, just say what you want, and leave me alone!\u201d\n\nThis is it.\n\n\u201cDO IT! SAY IT!\u201d her bloody right hand swipes from left to right, smearing your shirt with blood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d\n\nThe way her breathing hitched and immediately recoiled would make one believe she just got shot. Fang stood there, petrified, utterly unable to react to your words, you could see the small twitches in her eyes, left, right, barely noticeable, but noticeable enough for someone who spent three years in the Navy, doing its best to process the words you\u2019ve uttered.\n\n...Silence\n\nAn awkward silence sweeps over the dirty staff room, like her entire world just crumbled before her eyes, revealing what it truly looked like behind its fa\u00e7ade. She doesn\u2019t move, she doesn\u2019t blink, you can only see her chest rising and falling ever so slightly while she keeps staring intently at you, utterly dumbfounded by the words you\u2019ve uttered.\n\n\u201c... what?\u2026\u201d she mumbles softly, finally finding herself the strength to say anything, any fight and intensity previously in her voice gone for the moment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I said to you back then, and I\u2019m sorry for not considering your feelings\u201d you take another deep breath, you can only guess she never expected you to ever apologize  \u201cYou gave me your heart and I broke it, and not once have I tried to make things right\u201d God, the way she keeps glaring through your soul almost makes you want to turn tail, but this is something you have to do.\n\n\u201cInstead of apologizing, I just ran away, like a coward, hoping to disappear from everyone\u2019s mind, live alone and be a nobody like I always wanted, before meeting you. And... \u201c you sigh \u201c...because I never bothered to even try, you suffered because of it, I\u2019m sorry Fang, for all the pain I\u2019ve made you go through\u201d\n\nYour eyes watch her form carefully, hoping for a response, but she doesn\u2019t say anything, she doesn\u2019t even blink. Fang only continues to stare ahead at you, motionless, had it not been the subtle movements of her eyes, or the rise and fall of the chest, one might\u2019ve been led to believe she was a very intricate statue of what a broken woman looks like.\n\n\u201c...s-sorry?\u201d Finally, after what felt like eons of her processing your shared feelings, she speaks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re s-sorry?\u201d she stammers, dumbfounded and heartbroken. Her eyes close shut tight, fists curling until her knuckles turn white, and her clenched jaw gradually morfs from a saddened grimace, to a vicious snarl, displaying the rows of sharp teeth that could very easily tear your throat apart.\n\n\u201cYOU\u2019RE FUCKING SORRY?\u201d she snaps like a coiled snake, kicking the steel table, viciously flipping over the only thing keeping you two physically apart, over, sending all their junk food and narcotits flying \u201cYOU FUCKING RUINED MY LIFE, AND NOW, AFTER THREE YEARS, YOU SAY YOU\u2019RE SORRY?\u201d she angrily stomps right up to you and shoves a bloody finger onto your face.\n\n\u201cYOU COULD\u2019VE SAID RIGHT THERE, SHOWN YOU REGRETTED IT, BUT YOU JUST DOUBLED DOWN INSTEAD! AND THEN YOU FUCKED OFF TO NEVER COME BACK\u201d her extended index points outwards after sweeping motion from her scrawny right arm sends it to the right.\n\n\u201cI THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA APOLOGIZE, THAT IT WAS JUST THE ALCOHOL MAKING YOU SAY THINGS, THAT MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, YOU ACTUALLY LOVED ME\u201d You recoil and wince, like you just got gut punched by a pro boxer \u201dTHAT YOU\u2019D SHOW UP AND SAY YOU DIDN\u2019T MEAN ANY OF IT, AND WE COULD GO BACK TOGETHER, BUT YOU NEVER DID, YOU JUST\u2026\u2026.\u201d she groans, shaking her head wildly from side to side, still coming to terms with your unlikely apology.\n\n\u201cI LOVED YOU!\u201d now it is your turn to feel that same searing knife stabbing deep within your heart, her eyes screamed hurt and disbelief over your shameless attempt at apologizing after the damage had been not just done, but driven down to her core, reminiscing that exact moment in the beach where your lack of empathy shattered her feelings like that day was still today \u201cAND YOU JUST TOOK MY FEELINGS AND STEPPED ON THEM! YOU JUST LEFT ME! THE ONLY PERSON I\u2019VE EVER OPENED UP TO, AND YOU JUST FUCKING LEFT ME!\u201d you wince again, feeling another stab thrown with laser-like precision straight to the heart.\n\nAt one point you had a mind to interrupt her, but your mind soon pushes those thoughts away, as it transports you back to that rooftop back in highschool, in the moment you where you found Fang alone and bloody, preening herself out of high emotional distress, leaving her bloody mess, covered in leaking wounds, red dripping down her face and limbs. She looked like she had a lot of baggage to share\u2026 yet; you didn\u2019t let her, when she needed it the most.\n\nYou thought you knew what she was gonna say before she could say it, and proceeded to give her a half assed, unsympathetic answer that only did the bare minimum to reassure her damaged emotional state. You didn\u2019t even allow the distraught girl to begin confessing anything, she looked ready to pour her heart out... and you didn\u2019t let her, you just thought you knew what you were doing, like your teen dumbass always did, and she still took your blind words to heart.\n\nIn hindsight, you were kind of shitty to her\u2026 no, not kinda, you most definitely were awful to Fang, a huge idiot, yet she still offered you her friendship, and even her heart when you two confessed. Your own fists clenched in anger, not at the screaming woman in front of you, but at yourself for being such a piece of shit friend and partner.\n\nSo you do what you should\u2019ve done back then, you lend her your ear, your attention, you lend the enraged Fang your own body and mind for her to vent out any and all frustrations, every word, and every possible blow, instead of pretending you know what she feels and goes through.\n\n\u201c...AND YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SORRY AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR FUCKING ASSHOLE! SORRY\u2019S NOT GONNA BRING BACK MY FRIENDS, SORRY\u2019S NOT GONNA BRING BACK MY FAMILY, AND SORRY\u2019S NOT GONNA REVERT EVERYTHING BACK TO HOW IT WAS!\u201d\n\n\u201cSORRY\u2019S NOT GONNA FIX MY LIFE!\u201d she stops, heaving and panting, her reddish amber eyes, a result from the rising stress and blood pressure, bore holes into your skull. You wait until she calms down some, watching for her erratic breathing to gradually decrease in intensity, but it doesn't, she just continues to glare at you, most likely hoping you\u2019ll turn around and leave her life for good.\n\nAnd maybe you should, it\u2019d probably be better for her to not have you around her, the person who helped her get where she is, in garage tier band, doing small gigs for dirty, decrypt bars and restaurants, along two drug addicts, one of which could possibly be dead right now, and another who\u2019s such a great friend he doesn\u2019t even bother to ask if Fang\u2019s alright after this outburst. \n\nBut you don\u2019t want you\u2026 you want to help her.\n\nAs she\u2019s occupied staring at you, her chest rising and falling at a speed that\u2019s definitely not normal, or even considered healthy, you move one arm and place it over one shoulder, hoping that all that venting will lessen any backlash from touching her.\n\nBut as soon as you touch her.\n\n\u201cSTOP IT, DON\u2019T TOUCH ME!\u201d Fang reacts violently as expected, slapping your face with her wounded hand, leaving a bloody imprint on your cheek as she tries to wrestle herself away from your touch \u201cGET AWAY FROM ME ANON, GET AWAY. GET! AWAY!\u201d she wiggles herself out of your weak grasps, and funnels all her ire into one condensed moment of fury and sorrow meant to tear you apart. \n\n\u201cI FUCKING HATE YOU, I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU!\u201d she raises her fist and strikes you on the chest, again, and again \u201cIHATEYOU, IHATEYOUIHATEYOUIHATEYOU!\u201d Soon her other fists join in and she\u2019s hammering your chest, finally unleashing all of her repressed anger, hare, sorrow, all her emotional baggage that has been eating away at her heart for the last three years of her life.\n\nEvery single \u2018I hate you\u2019 is followed by one of her fists pounding your chest, over and over, with her unhealthily thin arms, you could stop and hold her back, preventing any lasting damage to you and her, it\u2019d be the easiest thing in the world considering the level of malnourishment she\u2019s at, but you can\u2019t bring yourself to, you just let her beat her frustrations on you.\n\n\u201cI HATE YOU! YOU HEAR ME!? HATE YOU!\u201d Her hands move from beating your chest to clutching your shirt, head angling down, shaking left and right, desperately refusing to acknowledge you came back to her life to remind her of all that she\u2019s suffered because of you \u201cI HATE YOU!\u201d\n\n*pant*\n\n\u201cI HATE\u2026\u201d\n\n*pant*\n\n\u201c... I hate\u2026\u201d\n\n*sob*\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\nThe grip of Fang\u2019s fingers on your shirt release clutch loosen, arms falling limply to her sides, while she finds her shaved head leaning against your chest.\n\nA sudden wetness spreads across the fabric of your shirt as Fang buries her head further onto your chest, letting tears that she must\u2019ve once thought were forever dry. Her weak, trembling legs, unable to sustain her weight anymore, buckle down, slowly taking her to the ground. Your hands move to her shoulders to keep her from falling and hurting herself, and lower her yourself, as she continues crying onto your chest.\n\nYou don\u2019t know for how long you\u2019ve held her like this, you both have been on your knees for only god knows how long, while she sobbed onto your chest, she wouldn\u2019t even allow herself to pull your hands off her arms, too busy crying her eyes out to even bother.\n\n\u201cI hate this\u2026\u201d she sobs, her hands come up to clutch her arms tightly, not once letting her eyes meet yours, most likely not even wishing to see your face right now, or too ashamed of letting you see how far she has fallen.\n\n\u201cI hate this, anon\u2026 I *sob* I\u2019ve left my friends\u2026 my family\u2026\u201d she confesses, so that\u2019s how it was \u201cI hate music\u2026 I hate this band, I hate my life, I hate it all so much\u201d her shoulders quake as she takes a deep, trembling breath. \n\n\u201cI left everything for this, because I thought it was what I wanted\u201d she leans her head harder onto your chest, and you can\u2019t help but wrap your arms around her quaking shoulders. If she dislikes it, she sure as hell doesn\u2019t make any effort to stop you \u201cNow look at me, heh\u201d she laughs some between her sobs \u201cI\u2019m a junkie\u2026 barely scraping by with meager pay from my plays\u2026 and I spend it all on drugs and beer, the only things that help ease the pain\u201d her hands\u2019 grip on her arms tighten, piercing the thing fragile scales with ease, drawing thin lines of blood, dripping down her arms and elbow.\n\n\u201cI distanced myself from everyone, even when they tried to help me \u2026 I just\u201d she sobs and coughs, her already not healthy throat having been destroyed by shouting and crying \u201cI couldn\u2019t trust anyone anymore\u2026 Trish, Naomi\u2026 you\u201d she confesses to you, and things start making sense now \u201cWho could I trust, when even my friends were hurting me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Fang, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d your embrace tightens around her, and again she shows no signs of pushing you away.\n\n\u201cMy brother, my parents, my friends, I saw all of them giving up on me after I gave up on them\u201d she sniffles \u201cThey tried so hard Anon, they looked so hurt... but I just kept pushing them away, all I could ever think were how you hurt me, and how they\u2019d eventually hurt me too\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw my brother getting married... my friends graduated, everyone was moving on from me after I cut ties with them, why try to help someone who refuses help, right?\u201d\n\n*sob*\n\n\u201cI saw everything moving forward-\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile you just stayed the same\u201d She stops sobbing for a moment, finally looking up to you, with surprise etched on her face, she looks into your own eyes, glistening from all the emotions swirling around.\n\n\u201cJust by yourself, in your own little world, thinking you\u2019re good by yourself, and that you don\u2019t need anyone else\u201d your eyes close, in a vain attempt to stop them from coming \u201cThat you\u2019re just fine having no one, just yourself, because you can only trust yourself and no one else\u201d why are you even trying to stop them? This is no moment no pretend you\u2019re stronger than you are \u201cAnd avoid the pain when you\u2019re inevitably hurt for having friends\u201d\n\n\u201cI know exactly how it feels, Lucy\u201d letting your eyelids open allow for your own tears to flow down your cheeks.\n\nHer faded amber eyes widen before they moisten even more, giving them that vivid, colorful shine you\u2019ve missed ever since that break up. The tears now cascading down full force, completely unable to hold back on the emotions she must\u2019ve bottled up for years, and she begins wailing onto your chest, her hands letting go of her arms to wrap you around your back, clutching the back of your shirt.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come back, Anon?\u201d she cries in your chest, and you embrace her a little bit closer to you.\n\n\u201cBecause I was afraid\u2026 afraid of what you\u2019d say, what my friends would\u2019ve said to me, too much of a coward to apologize and get rejected any way\u201d your hand rubs circles on her back, carefully maneuvering around her plucked wings \u201cI decided to just keep to myself, and simply live with the guilt, it would be easier to just not get in anyone\u2019s way, to be a nobody, like I always wanted\u201d\n\n\u201cSince you had your friends and family, I assumed you\u2019d be better off without an asshole like me bringing you down, I never expected or wanted\u2026. this to happen to you\u201d\n\n\u201cI regretted doing that then, and I regret doing that even more now. I said terrible things that I shouldn't have, blurting out whatever my head came up with at the time, and not once did I take your feelings into consideration. I was a crappy person, probably still am, just\u2026 less, I guess. I grew up since then, not much, but\u2026 matured enough to fully understand how shitty I used to be, to this day I still don\u2019t know how you ever managed to once love a piece of shit like me\u201d\n\n*sigh*\n\n\u201cI know anything I say will never fix what I did, and that you\u2019ll probably never forgive me; but I\u2019m not asking for forgiveness, I just wanted to right my wrongs, at the very least let you know I\u2019m sorry\u201d you apologize one more time, resting your chin on her head, right beside her head fin.\n\nYou don\u2019t know for how long you\u2019ve held her in your embrace, it could\u2019ve been a couple of minutes, or maybe even hours, what you know is that you don\u2019t want this to end anytime soon, holding her again after three years, you never noticed how much you needed this until now, you never noticed how much you needed Fang.\n\nAnd Fang? She continued to cry on your shirt, using your chest as an impromptu pillow where she sank her face and cried into it, her own grip around your torso never faltering, if anything only growing tighter as her sharp nails started digging into your back, you can only guess that much like you, she has a rocky, if non existent relationship with her family, and is also in dire need of this kind of physical affection.\n\nBut all things must come to an end, and soon her crying simmers down, and her heavy sobs devolve into a couple of sniffles, arms still very much clinging to you as if her life depended on it. It is you, however, who ultimately separates, moving your hands across her back to her shoulders, you gently pull her away from you. Her hands grip your shirt tighter when she feels herself being pried off, but soon releases her hold, allowing you to pull each other off, holding her at an arm's length by her shoulders.\n\nYou two can\u2019t look each other in the eye, not really knowing how to continue from this point; specially Fang, who looks visibly embarrassed, but ends up being the to break the ice. She takes a deep breath, letting her chest slowly rise and fall, before sighing.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 thank you\u201d Fang licks her dry lips, tasting the words that just came out of your mouth, you can only guess that never in a million years she would see herself thanking you for anything \u201cI really\u2026 I really needed this\u201d\n\n\u201cTo vent?\u201d you assume?\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been bottling up since\u2026 you know\u201d you grimace at the implication \u201cFunny it was you of all people who gave me that chance\u201d she lets out a hollow laugh, but there\u2019s no smile on her face \u201cNot my family\u201d her eyes close, the pain of knowing her family probably doesn\u2019t want anything with her making itself known \u201cor even them\u201d she glances sideways to the two druggies lying on the couch.\n\n\u201cI look pitiful, don\u2019t I?\u201d she asks, every bite she had before gone, as well as the deep sorrow displayed moments ago, all she has to show as far as emotions go is sadness \u201cI mean, just look at me\u201d you do look at her, and you have an answer to that question.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything much worse than myself, to be honest\u201d you respond in earnest \u201cAt least you can say you have a job, and talent. I live off of a meager pension from being in the Navy and have no skills whatsoever\u201d you could count on your fingers the amount of useful skills you have, which is zero. Fang\u2019s situation is dire, but you know she has the talent to overcome this, and eventually turn into the musician she always longed to become.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be worse than becoming a washed up, junkie, bassist in a crappy band \u201d you cringe, your face wrinkling at the bluntness of her words, Fang spares no expenses telling you how it is straight.\n\n\u201cOh, it is, I spend my days watching anime in my run down apartment\u201d you smile, joking at your own expense, hoping to lift up the atmosphere. The corner of fang\u2019s lips twitch a millimeter for a millisecond, but otherwise stay down, looks like your attempt at a joke didn\u2019t quite cut it.\n\n\u201cStill a dweeb...\u201d she mutters, her amber eyes shine with memories from a time past, good memories you assume, at the very least enjoyable ones you hope \u201cI wish I could spend my days like that\u201d she signs, lips pursing in frustration \u201cAt least I\u2019d have a roof over my head, and wouldn\u2019t have to worry whether I\u2019ll make enough to live a little longer\u201d she\u2019s homeless? You\u2019re dumbfounded by that. That\u2019s\u2026 no, she doesn\u2019t deserve this.\n\n\u201cMaybe you can...\u201d you mutter without thinking. Both your eyes widen when the words escape your lips, why would you say that? Fang stares at you in disbelief, before they narrow ever so slightly, a sudden growing suspicion visible on her face.\n\n\u201cAre you implying what I think you are?\u201d she questions you.\n\n\u201cMaybe? It would be a step up right?\u201d her eyes narrowed further, her eyes took a sudden tone shift to seriousness that you haven\u2019t seen since high school, back when she wanted the truth about whether you had been there in the auditorium or not.\n\n\u201cAnon, I\u2019m grateful that you came to apologize, but I have to ask, is there more to it?\u201d her tone took a shift from serious to somewhat pleading \u201cPlease, be honest with me, are you hoping we\u2026\u201d she didn't finish the question, but you know exactly what she meant.\n\nYou sigh.\n\n\u201cI would be lying If I said it hadn\u2019t crossed my mind\u201d you don\u2019t hesitate to tell the truth, she deserves at least this much from you at this point. She looks down a bit\u2026 disappointed, you think? She might be thinking that the only reason you came to apologize was because you wanted to get back with her, which would be farther from the truth, yet not entirely wrong.\n\nSilence reigns over again, you two on the floor, staring down and the thick cloud of smoke covering the tiles from prying eyes. Another deep breath and again, it is Fang who breaks the ice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can ever get back together Anon, I\u2026\u201d she turns her head with a grimace, holding her arm, in a manner all too familiar to you \u201cIt still hurts, I\u2019m willing to forgive you\u201d Fang shocks you with this development, your eyes widen in disbelief, and seeing the look on your face, she nods, assuring you she\u2019s being honest \u201cAnd I appreciate your apology and concern, I really do\u201d you know she does, that kind of tone in her voice can\u2019t be faked so easily. Fang sighs deeply, and looks into your eyes \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll ever happen again... I\u2019m sorry\u201d you lean back a little, letting the breath you were unconsciously holding out.\n\n\u201cI see, don't apologize, it was unreasonable of me anyway\u2026\u201d  you look down, a bit dispirited, but not unmotivated. That was to be expected, still, you\u2019d say your endeavor was far more fruitful than it had any right to be, just leaving with you and Fang on possible good terms is an achievement in and of itself, considering this could\u2019ve easily ended up with you being physically assaulted.\n\nProof of that being that even Fang looks a bit regretful of what she said, if only because she knows it hurts you, if she weren\u2019t truly grateful of you owning up and apologizing, and being the receptacle she so desperately needed to relieve herself of all the repressed feelings, there would be no regret in those eyes; she cares, even if just a bit, and that\u2019s enough for you. But her own wounds are still open and in need of healing, and that, of course, takes priority over your unrealistic desire to reconnect romantically with her.\n\nYour apology is the first step towards healing her broken heart, you have to follow it up with supporting her.\n\n\u201cCan we\u2026\u201d you start, not really sure if she\u2019ll be up to it, you could get another rejection, which makes you hesitate to ask.\n\n\u201c???\u201d she focuses her attention on your face again, and those eyes convince you to go through, as silly of a question it might be.\n\n\u201cCan we... at least be friends again?\u201d you ask, in a hopeful tone. Even if you could never have Fang again, just being friends with her would be enough, you feel. You don\u2019t want to be alone anymore, and you\u2019re sure neither does she, and a friend is exactly what both of you need.\n\nA slightly befuddled expression claims her face, the amber of her eyes shining ever so slightly as they widen, and her lips parting in light bewilderment, but that doesn\u2019t last very long.\n\nFor the first time, in what could possibly be years, Fang smiles, a simple, serene smile on her face, one you have seen only once in your life, back at the rooftop, when you didn\u2019t help her at all, she still gave you the most enchanting, beautiful smile you\u2019ve ever laid eyes on, grateful for assuring her. and there she is, doing it again, and looking ready to cry all over again to boot, only not in sorrow and sadness this time. She catches herself, and giggles some, wiping one of her eyes with the base of her palm, while trying to keep the sobs from coming up again.\n\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d she sniffles \u201cYes, I would like that\u201d she leans over and hugs you again, snaking her arms under your arms, letting her hands grip your shoulders from behind. \u201cI missed you, Anon\u201d she confesses, burying her face on your shoulder, where you feel the fabric quickly growing wetter on that spot. And you fully embrace her as well, with your hand resting at the back of her head, and your cheek laying on top of hers.\n\n\u201cI missed you too, Lucy\u201d ","Title":"Ending... 2?","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Exhibitionism.txt":{"path":["Fang","Exhibitionism.txt"],"text":"Title: Exhibitionism\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: Semi-NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n>It's been around one or two months since me and Fang have been dating (give or take a few days).\n>Walking into school together, helping each other with classes, and getting back to music after that day we slacked off doing studying.\n>Seeing her methodical impromptu song from my barebones excuse of playing.\n>But seeing her in her most shut-in form was amazing.\n>Afterwards we\u2019ve practically been inseparable, much to the odd seething by Trish.\n>After that whole fiasco in the theater I\u2019m amazed I didn\u2019t strangle her right then and there.\n>Then again, I\u2019m not the only person in the world here.\n>But getting back to Fang, besides her more shut-in and (objectively) cute side, I noticed something else that I didn\u2019t realize before.\n>That way she sometimes gets in her stride on and off.\n>And I could swear that something was missing from\u2026\n>\u201dAnon!\u201d\n>I snap back up, mere inches away from slamming my face onto the desk.\n>Fang is shaking my shoulder, getting me out of my daydreaming.\n>\u201dCome on,do you want to do homework again on a Friday night?\u201d\n>Wait, what class was this again?\n>I look up, seeing Mr. Carldewskii trying to hide his very obvious crappy romance novel behind his math textbook.\n>Glancing down at my assignment paper, save for a small splash of drool there\u2019s just a few (albeit tricky) problems left.\n>\u201dYeah, sorry, just dozing off.\u201d\n>She huffs in annoyance before turning to the sheet.\n>It takes a few minutes, but we get it done easily by helping each other out.\n>The bell rings and we step out towards the end of the horde of students.\n>\u201dSo what was the daydreaming about?\u201d\n>She turns her curious glance into a devilish grin.\n>\u201dThinking how sexy Mr. Carldewskii would be in a speedo\u2026?\u201d\n>I gag from the thought, Fang laughing her ass off from it.\n>\u201dUgh, no,I\u2019ve just\u2026\u201d\n>I trail off finding it hard to speak up.\n>Fang waits patiently as I try to find the right words.\n>\u2019Hello yes, I am asking if you are some sort of degenerate.\u2019\n>Yeah, that\u2019s a good way to get murdered.\n>\u2019Anyways, how\u2019s your sex life?\u2019\n>No, not the time to quote The Cave.\n>I hear Fang sigh as she nudges me to a more out of the way \n>I\u2019m lightly pushed against the wall as she looks at me with those amber eyes.\n>Damn it, time to ask.\n>\u201dFang, are you going to school without your under-\u201d\n>Before I can finish she smacks a hand against my mouth, muffling the rest of my words of social destruction.\n>\u201dSh-Shut up!

The events of the auditorium are still fresher in people\u2019s minds than I would like it to be, even no at the end of March. Fang is usually around to give me some backup (you wouldn\u2019t believe what a well-timed hiss from an angry ptero-GF can do to a snide comment), but she\u2019s busy today with a project for another class, leaving me to fend for myself. We\u2019ve been dating for almost a month now, our relationship really heating up since she spent those fateful days in my apartment. Things between Fang and Trish are still tense; Trish just can\u2019t take a hint to leave Fang alone, and every time I bring it up to Fang, she tries changing the subject, usually in dramatic and\u2026 suggestive ways. Still, all things considered things are looking up, and as I slip into Mr. Carleciidewski\u2019s classroom my phone buzzes, Fang\u2019s texts a welcome balm to sooth my worried soul.\n\nFang: hey\nAnon: hey :P\nFang: so we didn\u2019t get to spend much time together last night lol\nAnon: well your dad makes it pretty hard too, with all the wanting to murder me and stuff.\nFang: lol, you\u2019re getting pretty quick at leaping out my window :V\nFang: hands still burned?\n\nChuckling, I absently run my fingers across my palm, the red welts still slightly painful. Anything would be worth the time I get to spend with Fang, but that bedsheet rope has been killer.\n\nAnon: not too bad now\n\nAn ellipse from Fang lets me know she\u2019s writing something a little longer in response. Each time I shimmy out of her window, hearing her dad storm up the stairs like an avalanche, Fang always greets me the next morning at school with a consoling kiss on each palm, her amber eyes lowered seductively. I missed those kisses because of her stupid project today, just my luck to be snoot-blocked by freakin\u2019 schoolwork. \n\nFang: good you need those hands to help me in science and stuff lol :V you sittin in the back? can\u2019t let anyone peek lol\n\nGlancing at the clock, it\u2019s still a few minutes until the period starts. Most of the class has arrived, assembled in the desks in front of me. Reed gives me a little nod as he takes his seat near the front, his purple partner is crime mercifully absent once again. My reputation as a weeb hasn\u2019t done me any favors, and I\u2019ve taken refuge at the back of the class, thankful that Reed has given me some space. He tried sticking up for me when the class started targeting me, but I grew tired of the walled up balls of paper and other school supply detritus that was getting lobbed at my head. I was safer at the back now.\n\nAnon: nope I\u2019m pretty much a leaper now.\nFang: good <:V\nFang: ur hands r probably too sore to jerk it, huh? :V\n\nI can feel myself twitch as I read Fang\u2019s text.

Mr. Carlekidiwsky doesn\u2019t seem to notice, his head still laid back, faint snores emanating from the dirty magazine draped haphazardly over his face. My phone buzzes once more, the message taking a little while to pop up. It\u2019s a selfie of Fang, seated in a bathroom stall. My eyes widen as I realize her pants are open, one hand thrust in her panties, the other held out to take the snapshot. Only her snoot is visible, but I can still see the wicked grin on her face.\n\nFang: might have been helping myself out too lol :V\nAnon: :O\nFang: you n\u2019 me tonight, ok?\nAnon: sure ;)\nFang: good lol, gonna make you squirt like I did ;V\nFang: oh, one more thing:\n\nFang\u2019s next message takes a while to arrive, the tardy bell finally kicking Mr. Carlikediwssky out of his slumber.\n\nFang: parents gonna be out of town tonight, some lame church thing, and Naser\u2019s got a track meet <;V\nFang: so maybe we do a little more than just jerking you off\nFang: okay?\n\nAt this point, my boner has assumed direct control of my body.

I hate being the one who has to lock up. Especially on Fridays. Not only do I have to stay the longest while everyone else gets to leave, but I also miss out on precious minutes of the day. With a brisk pace, I walk to my car, throw my stuff and myself inside, and turn the ignition. The vehicle peels out of the parking lot and onto the street. Mercifully traffic isn't too bad today, so hopefully, I'll be home soon.\nFridays are very special to me since Fang and I always reserved them as 'us' time. It started back when we were still in high school. At first, it would be to study or watch the band practice. Later on, it turned into dates and hanging out in Fangs' room when her dad wasn't home. Sometimes it was even dinner and a show. The food was usually either dino nuggies or Moe's Meateor lovers pizza. The show was Fang playing whichever song she was working on or teaching me how to play something simple on the guitar. The college years were the worst since the only way we could hang out was by either voice or video chat. Thankfully Fang had an unlimited data plan and was always eager to call.\n\nPulling into the driveway I can already smell something delicious cooking. There was no doubt Fang wasn't a star cook, but her mom was. Samantha leaped at the opportunity to teach her baby girl how to properly prepare food. 'The way into a man's heart is through his stomach' she always said. Fang didn't need that to steal my heart, though it was still nice having some varied meals. Even the best pasta and nuggets get old after a while, and takeout has its own problems. Approaching the door, the smell gets stronger and I can hear a song playing. I step inside, the entire house smelling of something delicious. It was summer, and with school out, Fang had more time to make something extra special. I enter the kitchen to greet my ptero wife. She's busy behind the stove and doesn't notice me enter. Fang is wearing a black t-shirt with a logo from one of her favorite bands, most of the backside missing to make space for her wings. She has the same type of black jeans as she wore during high school, just not completely torn up. To top it off she's wearing, an admittedly cute, pink apron. No doubt a gift from her mom. While the sight might seem odd at first glance, it's nothing compared to the song that is currently playing from Fangs' phone. It's something I thought Fang wouldn't be caught dead listening to, yet here she was, singing and humming along. \n\nFang was using a wooden spoon to mix whichever soup she was making and rapidly wagging her tail to the song's frantic rhythm. She finishes tasting her dish just as the final chorus of the song kicks in. Using the wooden spoon as an impromptu microphone she sings the chorus, completely lost in the song.\n\u266aCause every time we touch, I get this feeling\u266b\n\u266bAnd every time we kiss, I swear I can fly\u266a\n\u266aCan't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last\u266b \n\u266bI need you by my side\u266a\nWith the song over she finally notices me standing at the doorway to the kitchen. I really don't want to laugh. Seeing Fang sing such a cheesy love song while wearing a pink apron is both incredibly cute, but also incredibly hilarious. Her face can't decide whether to turn pale or bright red and keeps switching between the two. \n\"H-hi Anon, did you just come home from work?\"\n\"I've been here for a bit\"\n\"So you...\"\n\"Yeah\"\n\"Well, you better not fucking tell anybody!\" Fang turns away to hide just how red her face had gotten. \"Like there's anything wrong with singing a love song if you're in love.\"\n\nI put down my stuff and approach her from behind. Before she can turn around I hug her from behind and place my head on her shoulder.\n\"I thought you sounded great. Who's the lucky guy though?\"\nFang lets out a sigh, \"You're such a dweeb.\" She rests her head against one of my arms and I can feel her tail struggle to wag while I'm pressed against her. \n\"So, what are you making?\"\n\"Just something from my moms' cookbook. Can't believe she let me borrow the thing.\" Fang takes the wooden spoon and grabs a bit of the soup she's making.\n\"Want a taste?\"\n\"Sure\"\nFang slowly moves the spoon towards my mouth, \"Just be careful, it's hot. You don't want to burn your mouth if you know what's good for you.\"\nI give it a quick blow before tasting, \"Wow, this is really good. Your mom would be proud.\"\n\"Mmhmm. Can you go set the table? I'm almost finished and I bet you're starving.\"\nI lift up my head from Fangs' shoulders, but my hands go from around her waist, to her hips, and all the way along her tail. As my hands reached her tail Fang tenses up and releases a quick shiver along with a stifled moan as my hands lightly brush her stubby appendage. \n\"You just can't wait, huh? I didn't cook all of this just so it would get cold. Dinner first.\"\n\nI set the table and Fang soon after serves the food. It's honestly really good. Admittedly, being made by my ptero wife made me biased. We chat about our day and before long the meal is finished, I even went back for seconds. \nAs we're taking care of the dished Fang can't resist asking again, \"Well? Did you like it?\n\"Of course, why wouldn't I?\"\nFang continued, remarkably sheepish, \"You're just saying that.\"\n\"No, I'm not. Remember the first thing you ever cooked? I made my feelings clear about that one.\"\n\"The world just wasn't ready for pizzas with a dino nugget stuffed crust.\"\nNeither was \/ck\/. Hopefully, that video never goes viral or Fang is going to kill me. As I'm finishing up Fang goes to the couch and picks up her old guitar that was resting next to it. I join her soon after. Even with her hands busy, she wordlessly extends her wing as an invitation. Settling in, Fang starts playing a variation of our song. My belly full, a soft wing as a blanket, and a lullaby playing I can do little to prevent my eyes from getting heavy. Adjusting myself a little bit, using Fangs' shoulder as an impromptu pillow I make myself comfortable. Just five minutes, I'm sure the love of my life wouldn't mind if I doze off for a bit. \n\nAfter a while, Fang notices Anon starting to lightly snore. She stops playing and, with the utmost care to not disturb Anons' sleep, gently places the guitar on the side of the couch. Fang reaches for a blanket prepared for just such an occasion. She drapes it over both of them and leans her body against Anon. Putting her other wing and both arms around anon, she completes her hug with a light peck on Anons' head. Her voice barely a whisper, Fang lets out an 'I love you' before also closing her eyes.","Title":"Fang Friday","Status":"Completed","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous","Summary":"Fang and Anon doing their weekly ritual"},"Fang Is Extremely Horny.txt":{"path":["Fang","Fang Is Extremely Horny.txt"],"text":"Title: Fang Is Extremely Horny\nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Fang, Naser, Samantha, Trish, Reed and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n>Be Fang\n>See Human\n>Be disgusted\n>But feel pussy tingle\n>Go to NONBINARY bathroom\n>Think about how ugly and awkward that human was\n>Run fingers into slit and begin to rock back and forth\n>Tail waging with a song beat creeping into your head\n>Song about fucking humans\n>Feel your hips shutter and have the first good orgasm in months\n>Thoughts cloudy but still thinking about human cock\n>School bell rings\n>Fingers soaked with NONBINARY fluids\n>Fix pants, fix hair, decide not to wash hands\n>Make a point to touch that human soon\n\n>Human is at lunch with Trish and Reed\n>He's eating his cheap-welfare lunch\n>Come over to sit with them\n>Human's talking about anime or music or something stupid\n>He leaves his sandwich unattended\n>Perfect\n>When he's not looking, wipe your fluid covered fingers along the remaining bread\n>It's mostly dry but you see a few discolored spots where some of your NONBINARY juices ended up\n>Just as your claws were back in your lap\n>Human grabs the sandwich and eats it\n>What a fucking loser\n>Eating your NONBINARY slit fluids\n>He doesn't seem to notice but you can't help but stare as the wet spots vanish one after another\n>The human unwillingly going down on you\n>Suckling on your warm nectar\n>He'll never get to do it for real, he's disgusting\n>But the fact he doesn't know and you see the tiniest of strings of saliva stretch from his mouth to the bread as he ate\n>Your legs squeezed together and the blood rushed to your face\n>Your INCREDIBLY ENBY clit throbbed as you rubbed your legs together, using what little friction your tight jeans could provide\n>Reed seems to notice the flushed look on your face and you licking your lips but who's gonna believe that stoner?\n>Anon (that's his name, you heard Trish say it) finished his sandwich, still oblivious to what\nyou did\n>Maybe he'll smell your dripping NONBINARY lips and his body will want more and....\n>You push away from the table and head out of the cafeteria\n>You needed to go back to the bathroom before you tore your pants off\n\n>Third time today you came in the bathroom\n>Your fingertips were actually wrinkled when you withdrew them this time, after watching Anon eat the sandwich you were dripping wet\n>What the fuck is going on with you?\n>It didn't help when you climaxed, you could only think about his fleshy human cock emptying his extra warm cum inside you\n>It was true right?\n>Humans were warm blooded so their cum was ultra hot?\n>You felt your INCREDIBLY ANDROGINOUS slit tremble and couldn't believe you even had the energy to still be horny\n>The door to the restroom opening was enough to shelve the prospect of round 4\n>You had to crumble up your panties though, not that you gave a fuck, but they were absolutely soaked\n>Not about to leave them in the bathroom for some perv to find (oh the woes of using the genderless bathroom!) you stuffed them in your bag and shuffled out\n>Your jeans rubbed directly against your ENBY clit as you walked, it still swollen and throbbing for more attention\n>Sheesh it wasn't even estrus time!\n>Which means that human's disgusting sweaty body could be all over you without any risk of eggs\n>His warm, hairy, sweaty, smelly.....\n>FUCK\n>Stop.

Fuck it, her) usual calm and relaxed manner giving way to exasperation. \n>\"When would you say Fang's mood swings started?\"\n>That's a good question.\n>it feels like our relationship has been soured by them for a long time, even if it logically couldn't have been more than a few weeks.\n>in fact, the first incident that comes to mind must've been just about a month ago.\n>Fang had wanted to take me to a new music store downtown to check out their selection.\n>but then I offhandedly mentioned wanting to hit up a sports shop on the way back to look for some new sneakers for gym class.\n>Reed had told me that there were some affordable ones on sale, and I really could've used some new ones to replace the ragged, musky scraps that I had worn for the better part of the last 4 years.\n>as soon as I'd said my piece, Fang began making up transparent excuses not to go.\n>I'd even offered to do the shoe shopping another time, but the damage had been done.\n>Fang had asked me to leave and probably spent the rest of the day sulking in her room with a bag of dino tendies, while I had done my best to stealthily exfiltrate her parents' house, praying that her father wouldn't connect his daughter's bad mood to me.\n>Reed nods.\n>\"And what else happened right around that time?\"\n>hmyea, what did?\n>can't say I remember a whole lot of things that stand out.\n>in fact, the last month had been the most \"normal\" month I've had since I transferred to Volcano High.\n>except for the fact that Reed had started the hormone shit.\n>but that must've been about two weeks before Fang's issues started.\n>the effects the compound had l\non Reed's body had already been impossible to deny by the time we had planned our trip downtown.\n>something clicks inside my head.\n>I had mentioned that Reed had tipped me off on the sale and Fang hadn't wanted to go anymore.\n>and now that I think about it:\n>that time we had wanted to go the cinema.\n>Fang had talked about bringing Trish along.\n>I jokingly offered to invite Reed, and the plan had been dead in the water. \n>that other time she seethed at me after I told her we could spend an afternoon doing nothing, because I'd copy the homework from Reed.\n>Reed, Reed, Reed.\n>connecting every single one of her little episodes. \n>but why?\n>looking back, it's almost as if she didn't like me spending time with Reed.\n>but weren't they friends as well?\n>bandmates, even.\n>while Reed and I were simply bros.\n>but honestly, looking at Reed now, I have to admit it:\n>Reed simply doesn't quite qualify for the label of bro anymore \n>with a groan of frustration I bang the back of my head against the locker \n>of course she's jealous. \n>time to fix this.\n>\"Fuckin' finally!\" Reed cheers, pushing herself away from the lockers and opening the way.\n>did I mumble to myself again, or did she read my mind?\n>if anyone has opened their third eye, it must be Reed.\n>on the other hand, you could probably tell where my thoughts had gone from facial expressions alone. \n>not that it matters how Reed knows my conclusions \n>all that matters right now is that she lets me go and try to save my relationship.\n>Reed is hot on my heels as I rush through the corridors of Volcano high, dodging and weaving past the other students milling about.\n>Fang should be on her way to her English class, so if I manage to catch her on her way there, I should be able to explain the situation to her and make my apology just in time to leave us with a harmonious afternoon. \n>just one more corner and-\n>and nothing.\n>the hallway in front of the classroom is almost empty, the few students lounging about are a far cry from the loud masses that usually form before a lesson begins. \n>a piece of paper bearing the school's letterhead is haphazardly taped to the door.\n>I rip it off.\n>Reed picks this moment to catch up with me.\n>\"Jeez Anon, you could've waited for me, bro.\"\n>the tip of her snout appears in my peripheral vision as she peers over my shoulder.\n>\"What's that? Oh man, class is cancelled? Dude, I tell you, some people have all the luck.\"\n>I don't even react to her comment. \n>my brain is too busy making use of this new information to figure out a plan of action. \n>where would a morose Fang go?\n>the first thing that comes to mind is the roof.\n>but that's not an option. \n>Spear has made it a point to keep the roof access chained shut until the suicide fence has been repaired.\n>something about keeping students from doing things everyone involved would regret or something to that effect.\n>so what does that leave me with?\n>dino-moe's seems like a likely alternative, but gets dismissed on a second thought. \n>from the way the old rex had acted when I first met him he definitely didn't seem like Fang's first choice for comfort.\n>his little Lucy.\n>heh. \n>God, I really do love her.\n>and if that means that I'll have to risk losing my life at the only place I'll likely find her, so be it.\n>I'll brave the golf club once more.\n>\"So, Reed,\" I ask, \"you here by car today?\"\n>for a moment she seems bewildered by the question.\n>\"Yeah, like always. I need the trunk, right?\"\n>as if I could forget the bottomless stash of illicit substances that is Reed's trunk. \n>\"Right. Can you do me a favor and drop me off at Fang's? Like, right now?\"\n>her eyes light up and a thin smile creeps its way up her snout.\n>\"So we're ditching?\"\n>\"Fuck yeah we are.\"\n>Reed snickers. \n>\"Fang's right, dude,\" she says, \"you really are a dweeb.\"\n\n>\"Hey Anon, getting it on with the new girl already?\"\n>I ignore the shouted comment and jump in the passenger seat of Reed's beat up old junkmobile.\n>aw yeah, riding shotgun.\n>but I'd be lying if I said that the jeer hadn't reminded me of some questions I'd meant to ask.\n>should've asked a lot earlier, probably.\n>\"So, Reed,\" I start as we pull out of the parking area, doing my best to sound nonchalant, \"how're you doing? Everything alright on your end?\"\n>she gives me a sidelong glance, but doesn't quite take her eyes off the road in front of us.\n>\"I am fine. Happy as a clam.\"\n>well, that would've sounded a whole lot more believeable if there were some more of that Reed-energy in it.\n>not this hollow neutrality.\n>but should I push her on it?\n>I am so not ready for this.\n>cursing myself for having been such a damn social recluse that spent the better part of the time others learn to handle social situations watching japanese cartoons and shitposting, I make another attempt.\n>\"That's good. Real good. I am just asking because, you know...\"\n>My hands flail in a way that tries to indicate the whole of her body\n>\"...all of this seems like something that might take some getting used to-\"\n>Reed is still doing her best to focus completely on the road, seemingly determined to shut me out, but she doesn't manage to hide the snort that escapes her.\n>Is this a good sign?\n>fuck it, just keep talking.\n>\"-for all of us. So I just want you to know that I am here for you. So if you-\"\n>\"I appreciate it, Anon.\"\n>Reed has finally turned to face me.\n>there's a sad little smile on her face and her eyes seem a little wet.\n>\"I am going to be honest with you, bro. When I started taking the stuff, I didn't think that it would lead to something like this.\"\n>she imitates my earlier gesticulating before quickly returning her hands to the wheel.\n>now it's my turn to snort.\n>\"but now that it's happened? I don't hate it, man. Not at all. And that's what worries me. I mean, this is the kind of stuff that should make people freak out, right? So why is all I can think 'he, that's kinda neat'? Have I fried my brain that badly over the years?\"\n>she pounds the steering wheel.\n>the tears are flowing freely now.\n>trying to reassure her without interrupting, I put my hand on hers when she goes for the clutch.\n>for half a second she pulls back, only to grab my hand hard and hold on to it as if her life depended on it.\n>\"And no one seems to miss me, you know? No one at school's asking what happened to good old Reed. Sure, you guys know, our class knows, but besides them? All those little shits that treated me like I was their best bro as long as I hooked them up seem to think that I am just a new student and that their dealer buddy moved. It shouldn't fuck me up like this, dude, but it does. Even Trish, Fang... you, you all just kind of ignored things. Kept on keeping on as if nothing happened. And I get that. 'Reed must be going through something pretty intense right now, best not to make things worse', but what I really needed was someone to affirm my existence. Not just my current one, but that I was there before, you know? Something that says REED WAS HERE in big bold letters. Just- just a sign that people won't forget me.\"\n>she presses my hand hard, then withdraws, returns it to the steering wheel\n>I feel a warm trickle run down to my wrist: Reed's claws have drawn blood.\n>\"Anyways, thank's dude. It was good getting this all out.\"\n>there's that sad smile again.\n>\"Guess it's my own fault for net being more proactive with that shit. Always hated drawing attention to myself.\"\n>Now that's something I can't quite believe.\n>\"Come on, Reed. You are a drummer in a band. You play in front of people. If anyone can handle attention, it's you.\"\n>\"Name one band where the drummer isn't in the back, dude.\"\n>when I fail to immediately answer, her shoulders sag, as if disappointed.\n>\"Besides, we never had big venues.\"\n>\"But what about your parents? Surely they must've noticed something-\"\n>\"Those fucking deadbeats?\" she cuts me off. \"They never noticed me getting high. Not even dealing. If they thought anything was different, they'd tell themselves it's just a phase. Raptor Jesus knows they'd never confront me about it.\"\n>the car decelerates as it pulls into a parking spot and only now do I notice that we have arrived in front of Fang's house.\n>\"Alright, dude. Final destination. Get out and good luck.\"\n>\"You aren't sticking around?\"\n>\"Anon, I think the last thing Fang wants to see right now is the two of us together.\"\n>My face must given away how I feel about leaving Reed on her own after she has just unloaded all her emotional baggage on me, because the sad smile returns yet again.\n>\"Hey, come on bro. I'll be alright. Go and make things right with your girlfriend.\"\n>\"You sure that you don't want to stay?\"\n>\"Yeah, dude. Who knows, perhaps I shoot up a bunch of test, come back to school tomorrow as my old self. Wouldn't that be something?\"\n>her smile gains a desperate quality as her attempt at a joke falls flat.\n>\"Do what feels right to you,\" I tell her. \"Whatever it is, I'll have your back. The others will, too.\"\n>I finally get out of the car and offer her a parting fist bump through the open window.\n>\"I'll call you later, alright?\"\n>she lightly taps her knuckles against mine.\n>\"Yeah. And thanks again for listening to my bullshit, Anon.\"\n>before I have a chance to add something, she steps on the gas.\n>I watch the little car go until it disappears around a corner.","Title":"Fang's Jeaolusy","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Fang, Reeda and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"First Time.txt":{"path":["Fang","First Time.txt"],"text":"Title: First Time\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off \nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nFirst Time\n\nRoute 4\n\nSoft guitar chords filled the air as Fang played next to his bed. Leaning back in his chair, Anon listened while thumbing through the different threads available on his favorite South Korean Masked Wrestling Forum. There was something of a rebellion going on against the moderators today, but that was hardly new. Revolutions like this happened constantly, usually led by someone evading some kind of ban. Still, they never seemed to have any success, not that it was surprising. The mods did it for free, after all.\n\n\u201cFuck Jannies.\u201d He whispered under his breath, seeing one of the constantly reposted images that was always used in a thread like this. He had to give it to the people who were constantly skirting the line between being a normie and getting an IP-range ban. What they lacked in creativity, they certainly made up for in perseverance. Anon was tempted to add a picture of his own, just to stoke the fires a bit, when he heard the guitar playing stop.\n\nWearing an oversized t-shirt that she\u2019d somehow managed to procure and cut a hole in the back of for her wings, Fang looked up at him. \u201cYou say something, dweeb?\u201d She asked, cocking her head as she looked over her shoulder. Admittedly, as close as they were, he hadn\u2019t been quite ready to introduce her to the hellhole of his favorite pastime, which was why he was using his phone right now instead of his perfectly good computer right next to him. Desperately searching for something to say, Anon\u2019s eyes zeroed in on the first thing that he could see, namely her colorfully marked and well-used guitar.\n\n\u201cNew song? Haven\u2019t heard this one before.\u201d He said, desperately hoping that his ruse wouldn\u2019t be seen through. As was typical now, his cute Ptero girlfriend rolled her eyes before looking down at her instrument.\n\nStrumming a new chord, she paused and said, \u201cIt\u2019s Black Magic Woman. Seriously? I thought you liked old dad rock songs.\u201d Playing through a few more measures, he could clearly hear the classic Santana rhythm. Since he actually liked this song, he now felt just a little more retarded than usual.\n\nSuppressing the instinct to dive back into the warm and welcome embrace of calling people slurs online, Anon set his phone aside. Leaning forward, his hands on his legs, he listened as Fang picked up the pace. Ever since she\u2019d put down the bass, her practice on all kinds of different styles was showing results. She was getting better and better, something that bothered him just slightly. If people could actually improve with diligent effort over time, it really opened up new avenues for him. Maybe he could give it a try sometime.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean\u2026\u201d He began, biting his lip. \u201cI just thought you were putting a unique Fang twist on it. Cause it sounds good.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a flawless recovery, but he did see just a hint of a smile on her snoot as she continued to play. It took a few more minutes of near flawless playing, but the Ptero eventually reached the end of the song with a bit of a flourish. Strumming the chords mindlessly after the final note, she set the guitar aside before looking up at him with a distinct look in her amber eyes. \n\nRising up, she gestured vaguely towards the bed with a nod of her head. \u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d She said bluntly, and he had to stop himself from saying something stupid. It took just a moment, but the answer came to him just like it had with her less-than-gentle assistance in music class back at school. He knew how to react to this one! Fang smiled as he jumped to his feet, wrapping her arms and delightfully fluffy wings around his waist as they both dropped down onto the bed. There was no point in pulling up the blanket, since there was more than enough heat just in their embrace to make them both happy. And Anon had to admit, he was very, very happy at that moment. Who knew that the loving embrace of another person could actually be nice?\n\nNuzzling her long snoot against his neck, Fang hummed the same song she had been playing a few moments before. \u201cWhat do you even do on your phone?\u201d She suddenly asked, and Anon froze up as if she\u2019d put icy feet against his back. Which had, in fact, happened more than once in the middle of the night. \u201cI know it\u2019s not texting anyone. You don\u2019t have any friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, fuck you.\u201d He growled, and the Ptero laughed at the completely unnecessary and entirely accurate insult. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I have plenty of friends. You should know. You\u2019ve known them all longer than me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you were texting Naser?\u201d She asked, a smirk on her adorable face. When he shook his head, she immediately replied. \u201cOf course you weren\u2019t. You call him a bro, but you also wouldn\u2019t leave any messages where Naomi can read them. And I know you\u2019re sure as hell not messaging Trish or Reed. You don\u2019t need drugs from the latter and well, the former is pretty obvious. Is it Stella or Rosa?\u201d Grimacing at the thought of being in contact with the one woman who could guess his power level, Anon shook his head again. \u201cPlease, Raptor Jesus, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re messaging Spears?\u201d\n\nWith a sigh, he tried to deflect the uncomfortably personal conversation. \u201cI\u2019m not messaging anyone! Just trolling around on the internet. There\u2019s a lot of stuff in the world that I can\u2019t see looking out my window.\u201d Honestly though, there was a reason he kept his curtains closed as often as possible. No one wanted to look out to see Skin Row. Too much exposure would turn someone into a depressed doomer or something.\n\nWrapping one of her legs around his waist, Fang ran her fingers over his chest. As nice as it felt, he was immediately reminded of the complete lack of musculature there. \/Fit\/ would be able to tear him apart at just a single photo. \u201cC\u2019mon, that\u2019s a shitty answer.\u201d She said, and he had to admit that she was right. Again. As was usual these days. \u201cWere you looking at porn?\u201d\n\nThreatening to sit up and pull away, Anon saw the potential answers flash before his eyes like he was playing a hentai game or some Ren\u2019Py stuff that amateur devs pumped out on a daily basis. \u201cOh, it was porn?\u201d Fang exclaimed with a laugh, and he shook his head almost violently. \u201cIt\u2019s all good, you\u2019d just have to share. I\u2019ve seen some of the others\u2019 stashes, you know. Reed\u2019s got a whole drive full of weird music video stuff and gay porn. Naomi is completely into dominance. And you didn\u2019t hear this from me and I will absolutely kill you if this gets back to her, but Trish has a human fetish like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\nOpening his mouth, no words came out and Anon merely laid back down while presented with all this new information. He was somehow completely shocked and entirely unsurprised at the exact same time. The first thought that came into his head was somehow managing to use this against the Triceratops, but he supposed that Fang wouldn\u2019t be in support of it. At least he could mention on his favorite Snoot Drawing Discord that Triggers fucked human men, or something of that nature. That would be fitting.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not porn.\u201d He said, adding a firmness to his tone that he hoped would end the topic for good. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m not into any of that kind of stuff.\u201d It was as brazen a lie as he had ever told her, dwarfing the time with the concert on an extreme scale. \n\nResting her head against his chest, Fang shuffled slightly to better look into his eyes. \u201cWhat are you into, Anon? Have you got a type? Should I be wearing a shitty maid\u2019s dress right now?\u201d\n\nNow that was a mental picture that he could have lived without and yet was extremely grateful for. At the same time though, he was at a loss for words. She had seen his old type in full color back on that fateful day in the auditorium, along with the entire Senior body of Volcano High. But his type now? Anon wasn\u2019t entirely sure he even had an answer to that. Biting his lip, he gently touched the feathers of her shoulder, before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re my type, Fang.\u201d\n\nFor just an instant, she blushed. The moment was quickly erased as she slapped his chest and said, \u201cYou\u2019re such an incredible dweeb. Seriously? \u2018You\u2019re my type, Fang.\u2019 That\u2019s the kind of shit that they say in one of those movies my mom watches on loop when my dad\u2019s drunk as hell. Seriously, what do you like?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I am being serious?\u201d He said, insisting on the point. Anything to get away from the porn would be best, he figured.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re\u2026\u201d She said, lowering herself back down to look at her hand. The blush returned as she realized that he wasn\u2019t joking or being purposefully cheesy. \u201cAnon, I\u2026 Fuck!\u201d The exclamation would have surprised him, but he had an entire half year to get used to the way she thought through things. \u201cIf you mean that, really mean that\u2026 Does that mean you\u2019ve thought about taking this farther? You know, farther than we\u2019ve gone before.\u201d\n\nEvery single day was probably the most honest answer to that question, but it was hardly the one that he could actually give. Fang was looking at him with a very serious looking in her soft, amber eyes, and he had to stop and consider for a moment how to respond. Ever since that first day, seeing her from the steps, he\u2019d thought that she was attractive. He didn\u2019t even want to go into the mental images he\u2019d had of the girls in lingerie or Fang in a swimsuit. Pursing his lips, he matched his girlfriend\u2019s intense gaze and said, \u201cI mean, of course.\u201d It was honest, and didn\u2019t feel quite as awkward to admit as he had thought. \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous, and you\u2019ve got the cute rocker chick aesthetic down. So you can\u2019t blame me for wanting that, but there\u2019s more to it than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? What else is there?\u201d Fang said, her voice even softer now. Anon didn\u2019t believe for a second that she\u2019d never considered it either, but he had kinda opened the door for a bit of insight. Whether he wanted to or not, he was about to show her a bit of what made him tick, even if it came out as a rambled mess.\n\n\u201cFang, you\u2026 You make me better.\u201d He said, desperately hoping that spaghetti wasn\u2019t spilling everywhere as he spoke. Anon struggled to find the words, and he felt consistently more embarrassed as he continued to speak. Despite it, everything sounded alright, even fitting. \u201cYou didn\u2019t force me to be better, and I\u2019m not changing just so I can be with you or anything like that. I\u2019m the absolute worst at explaining feelings and shit, so just bear with me here. But when I\u2019m around you, I just want to be the best I can be. Like you know when you watch one of those big hype sports movies and when it ends you just feel motivated to get up and play a sport you were always complete shit at? And then the next day you remember that it\u2019s actually a stupid idea and you move on with life. It\u2019s like that, but the feeling just\u2026 Doesn\u2019t end.\u201d\n\nPlanting her hands on the bed around his chest, Fang leaned up to get a better look at him. \u201cAnon, I\u2026\u201d She began, only to shake her head. With her long, silver hair falling down around her features, she looked like something out of an old style art piece, the kind that get shared online with a meme because one of the background characters was making a funny face.\n\n\u201cHold on, let me get through this.\u201d He said, knowing that if he stopped he might not be able to start again. His heart was pounding, the nerves close to shutting him down, but he had to get through it. Gritting his teeth, Anon said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just some good or bad morality system in an old rpg. It\u2019s more than that. I genuinely feel like my time with you has changed me. Forced me to grow, to think differently than I ever did before. Fang, I\u2026 I\u2019m not perfect, not by any means. But I want to be better because of you. No one has ever had that kind of impact on me. So when I get to be with you, when we\u2019re here cuddling\u2026 I guess I do want more. Not just cause \u2018lol have sex\u2019 but because you make me happy. Not just in general, but happy with myself. And I want to make you happy as much as possible. And that just so happens to be one of the best ways to do it. Or so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\nStaring at him, her gaze burning holes into the back of his skull, Anon wondered if he\u2019d gone too far. That was all unbelievably cheesy, something he would have immediately ridiculed on a certain Polynesian Flight Simulator Board, but it was how he felt. For the first time in years, maybe even his entire life, he felt like he had a purpose when he was around her. He felt like he had a future. Taking up the guitar, getting more into engineering, even working out a bit here and there to get rid of his noodle arms, those were all side effects. Fang made him feel alive.\n\n\u201cYou are the biggest dweeb alive.\u201d Fang said, shaking her head. Something about her dry tone caused him to laugh out loud in agreement, but the Ptero touched his chest to quiet him down. \u201cI\u2019m just really, really glad you didn\u2019t start singing Hoobastank\u2019s The Reason right now. That would have been way too much. Anon, I\u2026 Thank you for telling me that. You always seemed so confident in who you were. Like you knew what you were doing. Like you didn\u2019t need anyone or anything. But I guess you were a lot more like me than I thought. It just took you saying more than you have literally ever said at once to prove it.\u201d\n\nThis time it was her turn to speak, and Anon kept his mouth wisely shut. \u201cI just wanted to be like you. To have you like me. For the longest time, I guess I saw you as the answer to my questions. But you\u2019re not. You never were.\u201d Ego stinging a bit, he prepared to respond, but she elbowed him softly. Fang wasn\u2019t done yet. \u201cYou taught me that. Intentionally or not, leaning heavily towards not right now, I didn\u2019t need to rely on anyone else for an answer. Not Naser, not Trish, no one could solve my problems for me. But you didn\u2019t even try. You were there for me, but you didn\u2019t do it for me. And I am so, so grateful for you.\u201d\n\nWith a shrug, she brought her soft, feathery wings in close around him. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know what the future holds. We\u2019re graduated now. High school is over. We\u2019ve got our lives ahead of us. If we weren\u2019t together\u2026 I would be okay, thanks to you. I would make it. I\u2019ve got my music, I\u2019ve got people who care about me, but I don\u2019t lean on them for everything. I can stand on my own two feet, and I\u2019m free to fly.\u201d Fang smiled, her eyes misting over a bit. Anon couldn\u2019t hide the fact that his own were too. \u201cThat said\u2026 I can\u2019t really see myself anywhere else but here. Right here, Anon, in your arms. You make me so, so happy too. I wouldn\u2019t do this with anyone else, and I wouldn\u2019t even want to. So, I guess what I\u2019m saying is\u2026 I want to do a different kind of cuddling with you tonight.\u201d\n\nPausing, Anon looked at the Ptero in a sense of disbelief as the mood changed. \u201cSay what now?\u201d He asked, completely unprepared by his extensive experience with roleplaying games for the sudden tonal shift. \u201cDoes that mean\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means I am taking your pants off, yes.\u201d Fang said, looking at him. There was just a hint of something else behind her smugness though, something that he recognized from a few critical moments of their time at Volcano High. She was nervous, afraid even. At first it was a shot to his ego, wondering if she was afraid of what she might find, but as she began to sidle down the bed he realized that that wasn\u2019t quite the case. They had never done this, and as far as he knew, neither of them had done anything like this at all.\n\nSexy phrases from confident anime badasses came to mind, as well as one liners by Arnold Schwarzenegger for some reason, but Anon quickly shut those out. Life had taught him that he didn\u2019t have that kind of game, but these past few months had also given him a lesson in being who he really was. \u201cI want that, with you.\u201d He said softly, and Fang smiled. \u201cTake all the time you need, I guess. No rush.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like that.\u201d She said, regaining her confidence. Taking a lingering look at his very obvious erection that had sprung to life under his pants, she gently eased her hands under his belt. It took her a moment, but she finally managed to get it off. With his pants loosened, it took only a bit for her to tug them down, with just a little bit of help. As he moved, Anon noticed her tail wagging at a rapid pace, definitely a sign of excitement. With only his underwear blocking access to his manhood, Fang paused again, just staring at the mound. \u201cYou know, I always figured I would be doing this to musical accompaniment.\u201d\n\nGesturing to his computer, Anon replied, \u201cI do have some playlists at the ready.\u201d She smirked at him, and he shrugged. \u201cWhat, you\u2019ve never imagined getting down to Faithfully by Journey?\u201d He demanded, and Fang laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve never imagined that. But now I am. Fine, get your lame playlist up. Let\u2019s see what awful taste you have in boner music.\u201d She said, letting him get up to waddle awkwardly over to the computer. It took only a minute, but soon enough music was pumping through the shitty speakers he had on his desk. Smooth jazz sounded out, just a little bit better than elevator music, and he yanked off his pants before jumping back onto the bed. Reaching out, he snagged his hand around her neck and pulled her into a kiss.\n\nFor what it was worth, the move took her by surprise, and Fang stayed for a good long while pressed against him. Suppressing the urge to boop her snoot, Anon could feel her hand trailing down his chest again. As she hooked her fingers under the hem of his boxers and pulled, he realized that the moment of truth had finally come. He\u2019d figured she had snuck a peak on the times he\u2019d come out of the shower, but this would be the first time she got a full look.\n\n\u201cWell, fuck.\u201d She said, but the tone of her voice defied the meaning of the words. Slowly wrapping her fingers around the shaft of his cock, she bit her lip. \u201cYou\u2019re bigger than I thought. Not huge, but\u2026\u201d Gently stroking her fingers along the sensitive skin, she grinned as he let out a soft sound of satisfaction. \u201cLike that? Just try not to blow up in the first minute or something.\u201d\n\nDeciding that revenge was certainly on the table, Anon reached down the small of her back, finding her tail an instant later. Fang froze at his touch, before warming up to it and letting him do as he wished while she continued to stare at his standing erection. Continuing even further, he slipped his hand between her thighs, taking a deep breath. \u201cSo long, virgins.\u201d He thought to himself before touching her dark panties.\n\nWith a little gasp, Fang looked down. \u201cNot quite there.\u201d She whispered, a hint of nervousness in her voice again. Shit. Cursing the information given to him by hentai artists, he shifted slightly to move his hand forward. This time, the Ptero hissed in pleasure, and he could feel the warmth under the fabric as he rubbed against her slit. For several moments, they just felt each other, exploring each other\u2019s bodies in a moment of mutual affection and indulgence. Maybe it was a little awkward, but Anon didn\u2019t care in the slightest. It felt really good.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna try something.\u201d She said, lowering herself down. Realizing what she was about to do, Anon froze again, only for his girlfriend to pause. \u201cBut, uh, I don\u2019t want you to stop either. Let me get these off.\u201d Lifting her hips off the bed, she pulled her panties down, completely lacking any sultry grace in the movement. It was a very practical movement, but the efficiency was completely lost on him as he saw, for the very first time, the soft mound of downy feathers where her pubes would have been. As she noticed him staring, she slowly lowered herself back down to the bed. \u201cWell, get back to it.\u201d\n\nOne hand reached out, stroking against her feathers, and he whispered, \u201cSilky.\u201d A moment later, he realized that he had said it out loud, notably as Fang burst out laughing. Burning red, Anon tried to salvage the situation, looking just a little bit further down to where her naked, swollen sex was waiting. With the same kind of soft touch he would use to pet his mini Roomba, he began to stroke her folds, sliding the digit along the length of it.\n\n\u201cHoly fuck, you\u2019re something else, Anon.\u201d Fang said, wiping away a tear. \u201cI\u2019m glad you were the first to do something laughable and not me though.\u201d Tensing up as his finger rubbed against her clit, she shook her head. \u201cI do love you, you know.\u201d\n\nAnon knew, and he loved her too. Bending slightly, he kissed her again, even as his hand continued to test out just what he could do between her pale thighs. When she broke away, she brushed her long hair out of her face and grinned. Now it was her turn, and he prepared himself for both the best and the worst at the exact same time.\n\nOpening her mouth, filled with enough razor-sharp teeth to make a lesser man shrink away, Fang stretched out her tongue to slowly slide along the underside of his cock. Pausing, she seemed to consider the taste, only to nod approvingly and gently wrap her snoot around the crown of his manhood. Sucking softly, if haltingly, she continued to use her tongue where she could. Anon was left completely overwhelmed, the sensations from below wiping out whatever clever catch phrases he would have used. Finally, he let out a single groan of pleasure, blushing as the Ptero smirked in response.\n\nAs the music changed to a new song, one that was more intense than the last, both of them moved a little bit faster to match. As Fang managed to slide down to fit nearly half the shaft into her snoot, Anon deeply regretted not putting a speed metal song in the playlist for moments like this. He wasn\u2019t complaining though, slowly discovering more of what she enjoyed in return. Every time he rubbed her clit, she would tense up, and easing a single finger into her depths was enough to have her purring around his member. It was definitely something to keep in mind.\n\nIncredible as it was, what Fang had said earlier came back to his head. Trying almost desperately to keep from reaching his peak a little too soon, he let out a long groan. Whether his girlfriend had innate skill or he really was just a complete virgin, he knew he didn\u2019t have long to go. Unwilling to accept that outcome, Anon tapped the Ptero on the shoulder, and she slowly lifted herself back up to look him in the eyes. \u201cI\u2026 Raptor Jesus, I need a break. Give me a few minutes, or I\u2019m gonna burst.\u201d He said, and she smirked, entirely too pleased with his admission. Narrowing his eyes, he gestured to her wet, swollen folds. \u201cLet\u2019s see how you like it, huh? Let\u2019s switch places.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring it on!\u201d Fang exclaimed, giving his manhood one last lick before shifting in bed. Placing her back against the wall, she spread her legs, giving him a completely shameless view of her lower body. \u201cShow me what you\u2019ve got, Anon.\u201d\n\nLowering himself down, he stared at his girlfriend\u2019s slit and froze. It was one thing to touch her, but it was another to come face to face with the forbidden fruit itself. Fang sensed his hesitation and giggled before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to bite you, dweeb. As far as I know, I don't have vagina dentata.\u201d Swallowing his nervousness, Anon extended the one finger salute to the Ptero and leaned in, opening his mouth. Breathing quickly, he stuck his tongue out, dragging it along his girlfriend\u2019s naked slit. When she moaned in pleasure, and nothing actually snapped out at him, his confidence soared and he dove in for more.\n\nWith Over and Over by the Smallpools playing in the background, he feasted to the beat. Literally moving with no idea of what he was doing, he tried out every idea he\u2019d ever heard online, some better and some worse. Spelling out his name with his tongue seemed to do alright, but nibbling on her soft thighs didn\u2019t get any reaction. By the time they got to the chorus, he\u2019d figured out a few of the things she enjoyed, and worked the area over with his mouth until he was sore. \u201cI wanna call you mine, and never let you down.\u201d Fang sang along with the chorus, her voice supremely better than anything he could have managed. \u201cI wanna feel it\u2019s right, over and over.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanna get inside, and take it up and down.\u201d Having nothing better to do, Anon followed the song, plunging his tongue in between her folds. Rewarded with a pleasant gasp as she lost the song for a moment, he moved even faster. Eager and enthusiastic to please, despite his lack of experience, he did what he could. Soon enough, Fang\u2019s juices were coating his lips and dripping down his chin, and he had no interest in stopping to clean up. \u201cI wanna live this night, over and over.\u201d\n\nThroughout the song, he explored her body and found what she liked. Just like before, it took time, but he couldn\u2019t really imagine doing it any other way. With Fang, feeling it out was the way to go, and he relished the learning process for every moment that passed. Like she had in music class, the Ptero guided him to what was best, letting out musical sounds of happiness every time he hit just the right note. When her legs were clenching around his head, he knew that he was nailing the solo, and that was good enough for him. Between rubbing her clit and deep, slow licks, he was perfectly happy with the results, and kept going until his jaw was sore.\n\nAnother song went by, and Fang lifted herself up to take a deep breath. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s good.\u201d She said, before realizing that she had said that out loud too. Smacking him in the shoulder, she growled, \u201cDon\u2019t get used to it though. It\u2019s not that good.\u201d Looking down at his well-soaked manhood and then back into his eyes, she smiled. \u201cI think I\u2019m ready for more, if you are.\u201d\n\nBarely able to nod and far from actually speaking, Anon watched as the Ptero straddled his hips. With his erection standing tall, she hovered just above it with her fingers on his chest. Taking her time, just as he had said, Fang slowly lowered herself down, letting out a soft sound as the tip of his cock slid against her wet folds. Hesitating, she waited for several long moments, looking to be unsure of herself. \n\nReaching out, he tenderly took hold of her hands. Threading his fingers through her own, Anon whispered, \u201cFang, only if you want this.\u201d The words had slipped out before he\u2019d even realized that he was saying them. A part of him accepted that as an internet shitposter, he probably would be more comfortable cockblocking himself, but this was ridiculous. Taking a moment to compose himself, he added, \u201cI do love you. And I do want this. But I only\u2026 Well, I want you to be happy too. I\u2019m not gonna rush you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d She said, surprising him. Kissing him again, she gripped his hands so tightly that the circulation was cut off for a moment. \u201cI want you so badly, damn it. You\u2019re being so\u2026 Friggen sweet right now though. You\u2019re supposed to be all awkward and shit. So just shut up, and let me do this.\u201d As if proving it to herself, she lowered herself down again, sliding his cock against her slit once more. Wings furling out behind her, Fang took a deep breath before easing herself even further down. With his cock suddenly pushed inside of her, it was as if explosions were going off in his vision. The pleasure was, well and truly, beyond description.\n\nTaking nearly the rest of the current song to recover from that first descent, the both of them were quickly spewing out expletives and moans. Gently sliding up and down his manhood, her hands gripping his own, Fang didn\u2019t go fast at all. Admittedly, she didn\u2019t need to. The situation was incredible as it was, and all too quickly he realized that he was getting closer to the edge. Grunting, he tried to get her attention. Sounding like a neanderthal, Anon failed to get the words out, but somehow she seemed to get the gist of it.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d She whispered, her voice strained. \u201cMe too. I want it all inside.\u201d Like a starting gun going off, that last word was enough to send him over the edge. Anon groaned loudly as he came, feeling her walls clenching around his cock as she climaxed as well. Painting her depths in white, he had the best orgasm of his life, by far. It was over in moments, but it had felt like an eternity to him. For the while that his pleasure peaked, Anon was in heaven, his angelic girlfriend right there with him. In the clouds, he embraced her with everything that he had, feeling his love and affection reaching a new intensity he had never even imagined.\n\nBreathing hard, the two of them simply tried to catch their breath. Slumped against his chest, with her feathery wings wrapped around him like a blanket, Fang had tears in her eyes. These weren\u2019t tears of sadness though, something that he recognized well enough. When the both of them were physically capable of doing so, she kissed him again and again. Her tears mixed with his own, though he would never admit it to anyone, and for a long time they were as close as possible. Closer even, practically becoming one, he thought.\n\n\u201cWas that a stupid choice?\u201d She whispered, and he realized what she meant. Even now, he could feel the warmth of his cum dripping around his cock and out of her folds. \u201cDid Biology class even go over that kind of shit?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes Volcano High even have a Biology teacher?\u201d He asked, completely unable to remember the answer. \u201cBut whatever happens\u2026\u201d Pausing, Anon looked up at his cutie 3.14 Ptero girlfriend. \u201cI\u2019m glad I did it with you, Fang. There\u2019s no one else I would rather be with, not in all the whole fucking world.\u201d\n\nWrapping her arms around him in the warmest embrace of his life, Anon could hear Fang\u2019s soft breathing as she whispered words of love in return. Whatever happened next, they were together, and that was all that he needed. His eyes drifted over to his phone, wondering how he would mention this to his favorite Peruvian Matte Drinking Chatroom. Maybe something about how they were all going to make it, or how Ptero GF\u2019s were best.\n\nTurning his gaze to his lover, Anon smiled. For the first time in years, he felt no need to head to the internet right now. He had everything that he wanted, everything that he needed, in his arms. That was good enough for him.\n\n*****\n\nYears later, sprawled atop the roof of Volcano High, Anon tried to catch his breath once more. For all the more \u2018adult\u2019 changes Lucy had made to her life, she still had a bit of a wilder side. Fucking on the roof of her workplace certainly played a big part of that. This spot, where they had first truly come to know each other, had become the favorite for his late night visits. He wondered how she explained her constant late nights to her boss, if she explained them at all.\n\nLooking down at his beloved wife, wearing a nice big wedding ring as well as the amber pendant he had given her all those years before and little else, he grinned. \u201cWhat are you looking at, dweeb?\u201d She asked, her breasts rising and falling quickly as she recovered from her latest orgasm. With experience had come skill and endurance, and they\u2019d both managed to last significantly longer than their first time together. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t get any cum on my skin again. The principal saw the stains the other night.\u201d\n\nRolling his eyes, he wondered what the younger Fang would have said about that. He doubted that she would have given two fucks about who saw the results of their lovemaking. Finally, he kissed her again and said, \u201cI\u2019m looking at the most beautiful woman in the entire world and the love of my life.\u201d\n\nBlushing once more, a sight that he never got tired of, Lucy gripped his hand tightly. \u201cStill gotta be sweet like that, huh?\u201d She asked, no hint of displeasure in her worn out voice.\n\n\u201cYeah, guess I do.\u201d He said with a laugh, kissing her again. \u201cNever saw any reason to stop.\u201d That much was certainly true. Even five years apart had never dampened the feelings he\u2019d felt for her, and on his return she\u2019d shown that she felt the exact same. Even today, it still amused him to think about the days at college. Joining with a frat while he studied, the more confident Anon had been approached constantly by his brothers and interested girls, but he\u2019d never even considered the possibility. Though they were on a break, his heart had been back here with Lucy, and he\u2019d never even gone on a date. They\u2019d texted constantly, sending memes of increasingly complex inside jokes back to each other to the point that they were practically speaking their own language.\n\nWas it unsurprising to find out that she\u2019d done the exact same thing? She\u2019d had options, certainly. Cops that knew her dad, single faculty members at the school, even the occasional student had all made a pass, but she\u2019d turned them all down. Even though the miles separated them, they had remained as close as they could manage. Lucy had never taken her Christmas gift off, always wearing it as a reminder of him.\n\nRubbing her fingers along the amber pendant that matched her eyes so well, Lucy grinned up at him. \u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t just ask you here for a quick lay. Principal is looking for parent volunteers to chaperone at the school dance. No one is actually volunteering, so I figured I would ask you. Up to relive some old memories?\u201d\n\nBiting the inside of his cheek, Anon was interested in turning her down immediately. Even if his wife had grown to enjoy working with the kids here, he wasn\u2019t exactly keen on watching a bunch of horny teens grope each other on the dance floor. \u201cThree questions affect the answer that I will give.\u201d He said, holding up three fingers. \u201cOne, will I be required to dance? Cause these guilty feet have got no rhythm. Two, will you be performing? And three, will you be wearing that sexy as hell purple dress from our prom?\u201d\n\nSliding the brown sweatshirt down over her breasts as she sat up, Lucy grinned. \u201cThere was no call to quote George Michael to me, Anon.\u201d She said, and he shrugged. \u201cNo, you will not be required to dance. You just need to stand at the side of the room and wag your finger sternly at kids if they try to make out on the dance floor. I won\u2019t be performing, as fun as it sounds. A preselected playlist will be used for the most part, with a small performance by a garage band of students. Sounds familiar, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Chuckling, she leaned in to give him a little kiss on the cheek. \u201cAnd if you say yes to this, I\u2019ll wear the purple dress to the dance. And afterwards too, if you behave.\u201d\n\nWith answers like that, Anon didn\u2019t have the slightest reason to say no. Grudgingly nodding his head, he couldn\u2019t help but smile as his Ptero wife hugged him warmly. \u201cWill you actually be wearing underwear this time?\u201d He asked, his voice muffled by her embrace.\n\n\u201cDuring the dance? Absolutely, school policy. But afterwards?\u201d She pressed her snoot to his ear, whispering some particularly lewd promises about what he could expect after the dance was done. Eyebrows raised, he was more than happy to accept that response. As she finished with another kiss, he turned to kiss her back with a big smile on his face.\n\nWrapping his arm around the woman\u2019s waist, he followed her gaze as she looked out to see the last light of the sun fading over the horizon. Life had been a wild ride, and it didn\u2019t look to be slowing down any time soon. In all honesty though, he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Anon had meant it years ago when he\u2019d talked with Fang, and he believed it even more now with Lucy hand in hand. He was a better person now, with a purpose that no one could ever take away from him.\n\nWhen he\u2019d first come to Volcano High, he\u2019d been expecting the worst half year of his life. A fucking dinosaur school filled with every color of the rainbow? A part of him would have rather died. But Anon had come to realize that within these walls he\u2019d found something far greater than he ever could have imagined. With Lucy by his side, he\u2019d found true and lasting happiness. And despite the challenges that had come and would continue to come, maybe that was enough.\n\nThey were all going to make it.\n\nFin","Title":"First Time","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Heatwave Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Fang","Heatwave Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: Heatwave\nStatus: Completed\nCharacters: Fang, Naser, Naomi, Reed, Rosa, Stella, Trish and Anon\nRating: SFW\nAuthor: Anonymous\nSummary: Fang and Anon hanging out and trying to endure through the heatwave that's gripping Volcaldera Bluffs\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nLate July and it feels like a deity with a craving for mortal nuggies has put Volcaldera Bluffs into a cosmic oven. The one thing my shitty apartment had going for it was the lack of direct sunlight in the summer. While others are being cooked alive I am just chilling, or more accurately, just simmering. Fang asked to stay for a few days, my terrible neighborhood being a trivial issue if it meant she could find respite from the heat. I hastily agreed, since only a madman would say no if their hot girlfriend asked to stay a couple of days at their place. Fang never elaborated on what she told her parents. Hopefully, Ripley won't kill me if, or rather when, he finds out. \n\nIt's early morning and it\u2019s already becoming difficult to separate my back from the couch. If the heat doesn\u2019t relent soon I will start fusing with the cheap faux leather. Fang has just exited the bathroom, finished with her most recent shower. \n\u201cRaptor Jesus, when will this shit end?\u201d Fangs' voice was strained, \u201cI\u2019m in there so often I\u2019ll wear a groove between your shower and bed.\u201d \n\u201cOh come on Fang, it's not that bad\u201d, I roll my head to look in her general direction, \u201cBesides, doesn\u2019t your kind like the heat?\u201d It\u2019s not the best idea to be a smart-ass if a girl has sharp claws, but spending so many years shitposting on a Serbian moonshine tasting forums gives you some bad habits. \n\u201cMaybe if you read that book I got you, you\u2019d know \u2018my kind\u2019 is warm-blooded\u201d, Fang said in a huff. It\u2019s true, I haven\u2019t read the entire book. Mainly because certain chapters demanded all of my attention. You could call me an expert on certain parts of ptero girl anatomy, hopefully soon I will be able to become an expert in both the theoretical and practical sense. Fang gets a mischievous grin \u201cBut if you\u2019re not bothered by this damn heat you won\u2019t mind this.\u201d In a blink of an eye, Fang leaps onto the couch, her light body barely causing a stir. Fang puts her arms around my waist and gingerly rests her head onto her favorite spot on my chest.\n\nIf anyone asked I would claim this was all according to plan. With only a few words I convinced my ptero girlfriend to want to cuddle with me during this oppressive heat. This was all according to plan and not dumb luck. I slowly put my right hand around her back and start caressing her side. Fang let out a light sigh, a short burst of wagging from her cute tail indicating she was enjoying the moment. Thanks to her most recent shower Fang was still pleasantly cool to the touch. The heat and I would make sure of that wouldn\u2019t be the case for much longer. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the heat cut this cuddling session short. I decided to make my peace with dying from heatstroke. There was no way in hell I\u2019m telling Fang to let go. Not that I thought she\u2019d be upset, but rather that I didn\u2019t want the moment to ever end. My only regret was not setting up anything to automatically purge my internet history. Should have listened to Reed.\n\nMy musings are cut short when Fangs lets out a surprised sound. \u201cOh, what are you looking for down there Anon?\u201d My hand took advantage of my distracted mind and went on a little trip of its own. It almost made its way to Fangs' exposed rear. I do a quick double-take. There were usually jeans covering all of what laid bare before me. The only article of clothing I could see was a thin black line making a small indent in Fangs' waist. I glance down to get a full look and saw Fang was wearing nothing more than her black halter top and underwear. She was practically naked. Fang adjusts her head to look up at me, her voice dripping with sarcasm \u201cAnd here I thought humans were supposed to be brave and competent explorers.\u201d Thanks, hand, can\u2019t leave you alone for a minute without getting into trouble. \u201cThen again, even the greatest explorers made use of local guides\u201d, Fangs' voice switching from sarcastic to sweet in an instant. She put her hand over mine and slowly guided it down further south. As my hand was being gently pulled over the thin strip of cloth, Fang continued \u201cJust over the river and we\u2019ll soon reach our destination.\u201d The whole ordeal was like the time Fang taught me how to play the guitar in her room, except she was the instrument. As she put my hand on her firm butt cheek, she gave it a light tap and continued \u201cThere you go, safe and sound\u201d. My mind was racing, should I squeeze it, should I just wait for further instructions? The book did not prepare me for this situation. \u201cWhile you ponder what to do down there, I believe it\u2019s time to pay your guide her dues.\u201d Before I could ask what she meant by that, Fang put her left arm on the backside of my head and dragged it down into a kiss. \n\nAfter a short while, Fang breaks the kiss and settles her head back onto my chest. While my gray matter was doing an admirable job at stopping a flood of spaghetti from bursting out of my pockets, it neglected one crucial thing. My mouth. \u201cFang, where are your pants?\u201d I blurt out like a lagging idiot. \nFang lazily replied, \u201cToo hot for pants\u201d. Damn right you are. At that, I could feel Fangs' embrace slightly tighten and she let out a small giggle. \n\u201cNice save Romeo,\u201d Fangs' tail making a few loud thumps against the couch. For once my mumbling was beneficial. I was being completely truthful as well. Her physique was pretty much perfect and probably earned Fang many envious glances over the years. It wasn\u2019t just visually appealing either, while a thin girl, Fang still had enough muscle and strategic deposits of fat to make touching feel as good as looking.  \n\nMy deep contemplation about Fang's tight bod was once again cut short when she spoke up. \u201cSo, how long are you going to act tough before you admit the heat is unbearable?\u201d, her amber orbs looking up at me, knowing full well she was at the moment too hot to handle. \nI had forgotten the words that got me into this blissful situation so I simply replied: \u201cI've made my choice, if this is how I go then so be it.\u201d Fang let out a laugh and broke her embrace. She leaned back on both hands giving me a full view of her barely covered body.\n\u201cAnon you dweeb, you barely managed to get to second base and you're already content with ending it all? Have some ambition.\u201d, her playful voice making it clear she was just teasing. When Fang caught me staring she slowly swayed her hips from side to side and asked \u201cSee anything you like Anon?\u201d, her mirthful voice betraying that she enjoyed using me as a puppet with her sultry moves. Since my mouth could not be trusted it was decided with a unanimous vote by all higher mental functions to say nothing and just nod in approval. \u201cAw, that\u2019s it? You have nothing to say about my little show? I kind of like it when you blurt out stupid shit.\u201d Fang is now leaning only on one hand and slowly tracing a clawed finger starting at her lower midriff and going ever higher. I can\u2019t help but stare like an idiot once again. As she reaches her neck she makes a short pause. \u201cI have to say, making you squirm like this is a real turn on\u201d, with that said she does her best at seductively biting her finger. The logical part of my brain would claim that while the show so far was great, the whole finger biting part was fumbled. The problem is my brain was currently operating off of blood IOUs from my lower member. Running on backup power meant my mouth was once again prevented from creating a sound that would give HP Lovecraft nightmares. Upon hearing the unholy noise Fang lost all composure and starts laughing like I just told her the best joke ever written. \u201cOh Raptor Jesus my sides! You should have seen the faces you were making Anon, and that noise, priceless.\u201d Fangs' laughter slowly subsides, wiping a tear from her eyes as she finally calms down. She quickly sees my utterly baffled expression and jumps from her lounging pose to a sitting one. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if I yank your chain from time to time Anon\u201d, her voice slightly apologetic. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re my\u2026\u201d Fang slowly puts her arms around my neck. \u201c...little\u2026\u201d, she leans closer to my ears. \u201c...pet\u201d, Fang ends her sentence with a barely audible whisper and voice hot enough to melt steel. Deciding to not waste any time waiting for me to respond, she drags me into another kiss. This one is far longer and more passionate than the last. If Volcaldera Bluffs wasn\u2019t in the middle of a heatwave already we\u2019d start one right now with how hot the room was getting. After a solid minute, Fang slowly ends the kiss, face completely flushed just like mine. \n\nFang gets a sheepish expression on her face. \u201cMaybe we should wait for a colder day though. I don't want to be charged with manslaughter if your heart gives out\u201d, her voice sounding apologetic. Even if things didn\u2019t go farther, getting a show from seductress Fang was always a treat. I nod in agreement and Fang visibly relaxes. I didn\u2019t have much confidence I\u2019d have survived the ordeal in this heat anyway. It wasn't even noon and the apartment was already becoming unbearable. No direct sunlight is meaningless if the entire area is being cooked for a few weeks.\n\u201cWhy don't we go to the beach to cool off?\u201d I inquired while trying to wipe the sweat off of my face with my already drenched shirt.\n\u201cThe beach is already crowded at this point, we'd be like sardines. Those fucking tourists probably took all the good anyway\u201d, Fang was not a fan of those weird tourists who, for some reason, used their country's flag as towel patterns.\n\u201cIs there nowhere else? You've lived your whole life here Fang, you have to know about a place where we can cool off.\u201d The constant heat made me desperate and I didn't even\n try to hide it.\n\u201cI know of a small creek not that far away.\n But there\u2019s no way in hell can we make it on foot before being burnt to a crisp.\u201d Fang slumped halfway off the couch in resignation\n\n\u201cFang, you know we don\u2019t have to walk\u201d, there were other means of getting to the creek. A short pause was followed by a resounding no, it didn\u2019t take Fang too long to figure out what I was implying. \u201cPlease Fang!\u201d my voice was getting desperate, but I stopped caring when my back got stuck to the couch.\n\u201cWhy can't you do it?\u201d, Fang now completely slid off of the couch with only her lower legs on the armrest.\n\u201cBecause he'll only do it if you're the one asking\u201d, probably not, but if Fang did it the chances of success were much higher.\n\u201cFiiiine\u201d, her voice being that of a stereotypical annoyed teenager, \u201dI'll call Naser and ask if he wants to go to the creek.\u201d I am a genius. \u201cBut you owe me big for this Anon.\u201d Oh no. \u201cFirst things first, get me my phone because I'm not getting up\u201d, I peel myself off of the couch and barely make it to the table where Fangs' phone is. I consider throwing it, but decide to just crawl as close as I could to my fallen angel and hope she\u2019ll be able to reach it. Fang snatches the phone from my hand, giving me a look of pity and understanding before giving the little rectangle her full attention. She begins furiously typing for a few seconds before stopping and letting out another loud groan. \u201cGod, texting this shit is going to take forever, I'm going to have to call him\u201d, Fangs' voice being that of resignation, \u201cConsider your debt doubled Anon.\u201d I was expecting worse. My girlfriend is merciful and wise like always. \n\nFang dialed her brother and waited. I collapse into a puddle of sweat and watch her slowly kick her feet as the dial tone kept repeating. After a while it was looking like Naser wasn\u2019t going to pick up and I'd still be indebted to Fang for nothing. \u201cLooks like he's no-\u201d Fang stopped talking because at the last moment Naser answered the phone. Even now there is hope. \u201cSup you little shit\u201d, Fangs 'greeting' sounded harsh, but she assured me siblings are like that. \u201cJust being slow-cooked at Anons place\u201d, I couldn\u2019t make out what Naser was saying and Fangs' expression was neutral, so I just hoped he knew where she was from the start. \u201cYeah, whatever, listen... It\u2019s hell on earth here. You want to go to the creek with me and anon?\u201d, I shouldn't have expected Naser to chauffeur us around. Can't say I wasn't disappointed it wouldn't be just the two of us either. \u201cCome on, does she have to?\u201d, Fangs' legs stopped kicking at whatever Naser said. \u201cAlright, fine, bring her with.\u201d Fangs knew it was no use fighting whatever stipulations Naser made if she wanted a ride in the NasCar. \u201cYeah, you know where I keep it. Also, bring the thing, we\u2019ll get the food and drinks\u201d \n\n\nFang ended the call and got up. \u201cAlright dweeb, I did it. Naser is taking us to the creek\u201d, Fangs' wings sag and she lets out a loud groan, \u201dNaomi is coming with him.\u201d Oh god, I hope Fang doesn't quadruple my debt. \u201cSome of the others are also planning to come. Apparently the cotton candy cunt was planning some shit, but now wants to do it at the creek\u201d, Fang started searching the apartment for her missing pants. It was a bit early for a reunion but it would be a lie to say I wasn\u2019t a little excited. As she slid on her torn jeans in one fluid motion she looked at me still lying on the ground like and commanded \u201cCome on Anon, get your stuff, and let's go. We still have to go to the DinoMart on the corner.\u201d Knowing it was a bad idea to make Fang repeat myself I quickly change from my drenched shirt to a dry one and get all the shit that one has in his pockets.\n\u201cSo what junk food are we getting\u201c, I ask Fang who looked at me like I said something monumentally stupid.\n\u201cRight, you couldn\u2019t hear Naser. We\u2019re going to have a barbecue Anon, so no junk food\u201d, Fang is practically pushing me out of the door.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know Naser knew how to work a grill\u201d, to which Fang starts laughing. \n\u201cNaser can barely work the microwave, I\u2019m going to be the one behind the grill.\u201d","Title":"Heatwave","Status":"Completed","Characters":"Fang, Naser, Naomi, Reed, Rosa, Stella, Trish and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Author":"Anonymous","Summary":"Fang and Anon hanging out and trying to endure through the heatwave that's gripping Volcaldera Bluffs"},"Heatwave Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Fang","Heatwave Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Heatwave\n\nChapter 2\n\nIt\u2019s even worse outside, the scorching air giving me a gut punch the moment we exit the apartment building. Fang is mostly unphased by the heat. She grabs my arm and we start moving at a brisk pace to the nearby DinoMart. I just hope my soles don\u2019t start melting on the scorching sidewalk. I want to ask Fang if she's being serious about being the one grilling or if this is just another joke. Can\u2019t talk in this heat though, if I open my mouth all the moisture will escape my body and I\u2019ll instantly be mummified. Thankfully we\u2019ve almost made it to the DinoMart and more importantly the AC inside the store. As we pass the threshold Fang gives me a concerned look, \u201cShit, you gonna be OK Anon? You look like you\u2019re about to pass out.\u201d I give her a quick affirming nod while doing my best to not appear like a little bitch who can\u2019t handle a little heat. Thankfully the store is mostly empty. A combination of the walk-in oven that is the outside world and an infamous neighborhood. At least no one will see the skinny suffering from early heat stroke. I grab a shopping trolley that has seen better days. Two of the wheels kept seizing up and the handle was sticky, but it was sturdy enough to give me some support. \n\nFang went on inside the shop and I did my best to keep up as she threw in things needed for the barbecue. Paper plates, paper cups, toothpicks, plastic utensils, garbage bags, paper towels. She gives some thought before picking which oil and charcoal to get. Fang glances back and gives me a concerned look, \u201cFeeling better yet?\u201d I give her a proper nod this time and Fang visibly relaxes. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s the boring crap done with, time for what everyone is waiting for.\u201d, Fang looks at me expectantly. \u201cSo, what do you want to eat Anon?\u201d I shrug since I don\u2019t care, which unexpectedly pissed of Fang. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that shit Anon. Either you pick something or you\u2019re sharing soy patties with Naomi\u201d, Fang wasn\u2019t taking \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 for an answer. I also didn\u2019t want to eat soy patties, because the next time some fucker on the internet called me a soyboy I couldn\u2019t just shrug it off anymore. \n\"I don't know, can't I have what you're having?\"\n\"How do you know you'll even like what I'm having?\"\n\"If your taste in food is as good as your taste in boyfriends I'm sure I'll like it,\" hopefully my gamble pays off.\n\"Wh-\", Fang stammers for a bit, getting more embarrassed by the second. \"Fine, but you owe me a special favor for being so indecisive,\" she moves closer to me and pulls me into a hug. \"You say stupid shit and mumble a lot, but sometimes you know exactly what to say,\" now it was my turn to be embarrassed. As the moment ended, there was still one burning question on my mind.\n\"Since when are you a barbecue expert anyway?\u201d Fang never talked about this part of her making it quite baffling. Who would expect a rocker chick to be well versed in the arts of grilling?  \n\n\u201cSince I was little. I liked being around my dad when he was grilling and when I was old enough to see the grill he\u2019d let me take over\u201d, a wave of nostalgia washed over Fang. \u201cI got good at it and by the end, he\u2019d let me be in charge of the whole thing while he mingled with guests. He was so proud\u201d, Fangs' voice becomes strained and it\u2019s clear it wasn\u2019t just good memories. \u201cThen I became a huge bitch and that was the end of that\u201d, Fang quickly composes herself and continues \u201cAnyway, DinoMart is no place for a therapy session, I\u2019ll get the meat and you go get some vegetables.\u201d With that Fang rushes to the butcher, the stroll down memory lane not being a pleasant one. \n\nI take my time getting to the vegetable section and realize Fang never told me what to get or how much. As I glance to the butcher I see Fangs' hands already full of various meaty delights for the grill. I just barely got here and she\u2019s already finished. As Fang turns around she gives me a little wave with her right wing and starts walking over. \u201cYou finished yet dweeb?\u201d, Fang gently places her haul into the trolley and looks at me \u201cWhat are you waiting for? We have to finish before this place gets robbed again\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never told me what to get or how much\u201d, I reply hoping to not piss her off.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost finished anyway, it\u2019s just this and the booze and we can go\u201d, Fang hands me a couple of plastic bags to hold while she piles in all the veggies she deems barbecue appropriate. Next up is the booze, we pick mostly mid to low-range stuff except for two bottles of top-shelf beer that Fang picked out. \n\n\u201cWon\u2019t the others be mad we only got the good stuff for ourselves\u201d, while I wouldn\u2019t mind sharing some good beer with Fang but I also didn\u2019t want the thing to be a source of pointless drama.\n\nFang lets out a laugh and puts the bottles gently into the trolley \u201cYou wish Anon, it\u2019s for the meat, not us\u201d. \n\n\u201cWhy are you wasting good beer by pouring it onto meat?\u201d not like I was an expert like her but it seemed stupid. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see when you taste it\u201d, Fang moves closer and brushes her hand against mine \u201cBut if you promise to be my assistant I\u2019m sure I could give you a few sips\u201d. I was sold on the spot.\n\n\nOn our way to the register, we walk past the freezer section. \u201cBefore today I\u2019d have thought the only thing you\u2019d eat grilled were dino nuggies\u201d, I was still trying to wrap my head around the fact that Fang has culinary skills beyond reading the instructions on a box of nuggets. \n\n\u201cThose are just my comfort food Anon\u201d, a twinge of sadness in her voice, \u201cFor the countless times I felt like shit.\u201d Fang just stares ahead, no doubt reliving some of those moments before shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019ve cut back on eating them so often though\u201d, Fang puts one of her wings around me before continuing, \u201cIn no small part thanks to you. When I\u2019m with you I\u2019m so very happy Anon, you have no idea.\u201d Her words fill me with incredible warmth with the little peck on my cheek from Fang being the cherry on top. \u201cDon\u2019t think that means you can stop stocking your fridge with nuggies though\u201d Fang slowly removes her wing from me and rubs my hand \u201cWe all have bad days from time to time.\u201d The short intimate moment ended we finally make it to the checkout and start piling the contents of the trolley on the conveyor belt. There\u2019s so much stuff, no way in hell will I be able to pay for this without selling my kidney to an Albanian. Fang just motions for me to start putting the groceries into bags and pays for everything with her card. As she\u2019s finishing up she looks over to me, \u201cOK Anon, this is where you start working on paying off your debt.\u201d Looks like I\u2019m going to have to carry all of this. Hopefully, I won\u2019t almost pass out. I split all the bags between my hands and hope I can make it to wherever Naser is meeting us without my skinny arms falling off. \n\nAs we\u2019re walking I try to bring up the money situation \u201cHow much is my share, maybe I can pay you back installments?\u201d\nFang feigns indignation \u201cWhat do you take me for Anon, a Rhinorex? Don\u2019t worry about the money, focus on not dropping any of that stuff or you\u2019ll never clear your debt.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are we meeting up with Naser anyway?\u201d better ask while I can still talk without wheezing. \n\u201cRight here\u201d, Fangs looks around looking for any sort of shade and failing to find any, \u201dHopefully before we both catch on fire.\u201d As if on queue the NasCar races around the corner and stops right in front of us. The curbside window barely manages to roll down before Naser starts shouting.\n\u201cGet in before some crackhead skinnie decides to shank us!\u201d Naser hates coming to SkinRow and I can\u2019t blame him. \u201cNo offense Anon.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken\u201d, it was a lie but it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t carry a pocket knife with me at all times in this neighborhood. As we\u2019re stuffing the grocery bags into the car Naomi starts running her mouth.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you guys called and told us about the creek. I was looking for a good spot for our little get-together for days. Can\u2019t believe Naser never told me about it\u201d, Naomis' voice was sickly sweet as ever. It\u2019s a wonder Naser hasn\u2019t developed a form of diabetes yet.\n\n\u201cHeh, must have slipped my mind babe\u201d, Naser doing his best to prevent another avalanche of candy-coated words from his saccharine other. With all the goods crammed inside the NasCar we barely have room for ourselves. Naser doesn\u2019t wait for us to get fully seated or even close the doors before hitting the gas. The wheels screech and we\u2019re leaving SkinRow behind at breakneck speed."},"Heatwave Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Fang","Heatwave Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"Heatwave\n\nChapter 3\n\nAs Naser continues living out his fantasy of being a drag racer, I am slowly getting swallowed by the backseat of the NasCar. Looking out the window I can see the dilapidated buildings whiz by in a blur. If this is how I die I sure as fuck ain't looking at my hellhole of a neighborhood. I turn to look at Fang, who isn't taking the impromptu horizontal rocket launch any better. She is holding on, one hand on the car door, the other on the groceries. I reach my hand towards hers and she grabs it with her own clawed appendage. She mouths, or rather snoots, an 'I love you' as the car finally starts slowing down.\n\n\nJust as I start to relax and stop thanking raptor Jesus we survive the pink primadonna turns around.\n\n\"Fang, I wanted to thank you for asking Nasi to take us to the creek. I still can't believe he never told me about it,\" Her voice is so sickly sweet I've already exceeded my daily caloric intake several times over. \n\nFang gives a light scoff, \"Nasi?\", her annoyance at being forced to interact with Naomi is only dampened by learning her baby brother has a pet nickname. Naser looks at me via the rear-view mirror, a worried expression on his face, along with several beads of sweat forming on his forehead. \n\n\"You two do look perfect together though. Even now you're holding hands, so precious,\" at those words I thought my ptero gf would separate her hand from mine but she held on. \"If today goes well we should do more things together over the summer,\" Fangs' expression is completely blank, but her grip on my hand has gotten noticeably tighter. \"We could even do another double date. Our first one went so well after all,\" Fang suddenly gets a thousand-yard stare while simultaneously deboning my hand with her own. \"I'm so glad I got you two lo-\", Naomi is cut off thanks to Naser deciding it's time for another round of drag racing. Passing out from excessive G-force is preferable to having to listen to Naomi drone on.\n\nThis time the excessive speeding only lasts a few seconds.\n\nFang is the first to recover, \"What the fuck is wrong with you?\"\n\n\"I thought I saw a group of skinnie gangbangers,\" he gives a strained laugh, \"you can never be too careful.\" The car makes a turn off of the paved road onto a graveled one. \"At least we made good time, we're almost there,\" he glances at me one more time, this time looking even more worried. Talk about being high-strung. Fangs' been holding my hand the entire time, the short talk with Naomi leaving its mark as her talons dug into my skin. We've arrived at the spot and she gives it one last squeeze and let's go, opening the car door before it came to a full stop. \n\nThe area is actually quite nice, it even has a table with a pair of benches under some trees shading the whole area. Close-by is a small concrete area, slightly blackened by soot. I guess people are too lazy to dig a fire pit and just use the area where nothing can catch on fire instead. Fang is already barking orders on where she wants what. Naser and I start lugging the grill to the spot while Fang grabs the grocery bags. All of them. She isn't even struggling like I was. \n\nNaomi rushes up to her, \"Do you need help, Fang?\"\n\n\"Oh no, I can handle it, wouldn't want you to break a nail or something,\" Fang drops the groceries on the table before continuing, \"Since you're the resident veggie expert you can prep all of them though.\" Just as Naser and I finish setting up the grill area Fang comes over to inspect our work. \"Yeah, this will be fine. You can go ask your girl if she needs help. I've got this covered with Anon.\" Naser is about to protest, but before he gets a word out Fang cuts him off \"Go, shoo.\" As her brother is walking away, Fang could help but snicker just loud enough so he could hear, \"Nasi.\" Her brother continues walking away, but not without a noticeable shiver running down his spine.\n\n\"Alright dweeb, I know you're the fire expert, you want to light up the grill?\" her racist remarks would be hurtful if she wasn't so cute. Fang hands me her pink lighter and what looks like a sugar cube. \"What? Just light the damn thing and chuck it in.\" Not feeling like asking further questions I bring the cube towards the lighter flame. It instantly catches fire and I chuck it into the grill. Not before the damn thing burns my hand though. \n\n\"You could have warned me what would happen,\" my annoyance is obvious as I rub the burned appendage with my other hand.\n\n\"Aw, don't be like that,\" Fang moves closer and grabs my hurt palm, \"Besides, I know how to make it better.\" As I'm about to protest she bends down and gives it a kiss. The ptero girl looks up and asks, \"Better?\" I can only nod, a slight blush coloring my cheeks. \"Good, now help me get changed\", she takes my good hand into her own and drags me towards the NasCar. I'm given a large towel while Fang grabs a change of clothes. From the looks of it there isn't much fabric, finally, Fang in a bikini will no longer be just my imagination. We go to a large nearby tree and Fangs tells me to hold up the towel. As she's about to go behind the makeshift barrier Fang briefly stops, \"No peeking, Anon\", with a wink she disappears behind the cover. I briefly ponder what the hell that was supposed to mean as her black halter top and jeans land on my head. Guess that answers my question. A few moments pass before I hear her speak \"OK, you can look now.\" I drop the towel and see a completely different-looking girl in front of me. Gone is the edgy outfit and instead, Fang is wearing a light blue bikini set and matching jeans shorts that might as well not be there. \"Well?\", she gives a quick twirl, her long hair flowing around her. \n\n\"You look great,\" I manage, thankfully without stammering. Well, maybe a little stammering since Fang just giggles and grabs my hand.\n\n\"Come on, let's go back to check what the others are up to.\" As we go past the NasCar I throw Fangs' clothes onto the backseat, don't want Naser having any wrong ideas. \n\nApproaching the bench we see Naomi hasn't made much progress on prepping the vegetables. The pink psycho looks up, clearly annoyed with how slowly the work is progressing, \"Wow, Fang, cute outfit. Doesn't leave much to the imag-.\" She's cut off once again, this time by a loud bang. Maybe Naser was right, there are skinnie gangbangers around here. Thankfully I was wrong, it was just Reeds' beat-up van announcing his arrival. Reed parks the van next to the NasCar, possibly too close with how worried Naser was looking. The group starts spilling out, Reed in his usual casual swagger, while the girls look like they've just had a life and death experience.\n\n\"Wazzup broskis, we miss much?\", Reed takes a quick swig from his trusty thermos, not really expecting an answer. Trish, Rosa, and Stella make their way towards us next. Stella is holding onto Rosa who is doing her best to comfort her.\n\n\"Calm down chica, I told you raptor Jesus would see us through\", Rosa helps Stella take a seat on the bench. Even Trish looks rattled as she approaches.\n\nFang moves towards Trish, \"What the hell is wrong with you guys?\"\n\nThe purple triceratops slowly looks at Fang, \"Here's a tip, if Reed ever offers to drive, say no\"\n\nReed begins to protest, \"Oh come on, it wasn't that bad\"\n\n\"Yes it was!\", all three of his passengers respond in unison. \n\n\"I know what will cheer you guys up, come on Anon, time to earn your keep,\" Fang grabs the bag of meat with one hand and me with the other. \n\n\n\nIn quick order, Fang gets the grill ready and starts expertly placing the delicacies on the grate. While she tends to the food, I'm bossed around, fetching plates, beer, whatever else she might need. Although bossed around might be too harsh, she is genuinely grateful that I'm helping her and does keep her promise of giving me a taste of the top-shelf beer we bought. As the first round is almost done she picks up one finger-sized piece and tells me to taste it. I slightly hesitate because I don't want to burn my mouth. \"Come on Anon, if you get burned again I'll make it better, I promise,\" with her 'encouragement' I take a bite. It is the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. \"Well?\", the ptero looks at me expectantly.\n\n\"It's incredible, you sure we can't just eat this round and let the others wait a bit longer?\", the delicious food suddenly made me realized I haven't eaten anything all day. \n\n\"You saw the others need it more than we do, go cheer them up,\" Fang stacks the empty plate I'm holding with the grilled food and starts loading up more on the rack. \"Hurry back though, I don't want to be without my assistant for too long\", a quick pat on my butt sends me on my way. \n\nApproaching the table I see the others have also gotten into the spirit of things. Reed and Naser are setting up some music by hooking up an oversized speaker to Reeds' beat-up van. Rosa is helping Naomi with the vegetable preparations, though compared to Rosa's expertise, Naomi is just getting in the way. Stella and Trish are setting up the table at a leisure pace, idly chatting about god knows what. Reed is the first to pick up the scent of freshly barbecued meat.\n\n\"Finally, I've always wanted to taste Fangs' cooking,\" the raptor abandons Naser, grabs a plate, and starts piling it high. The others barely get a few morsels before nothing is left to take.\n\n\"Don't worry, there's plenty more where that came from,\" I quickly escape the ravenous horde before they can say anything. Coming back I see Fang absentmindedly swiping her phone with one hand and taking care of the grill with the other. \n\nShe looks up as I approach, \"Well, did they like it?\"\n\n\"Reed sure as hell did, the others didn't get much of a chance to sample anything,\" I hold up the empty plate, \"hope you got a lot more for that bottomless hole of his.\" A few more trips back and forth and the food stopped evaporating as soon as I get to the table. The guys finally\n got some music playing, mostly classic rock with some VVURM DRAMA songs mixed in. Stella is finally giving Reed a tarot reading, while the other girls chat among themselves. The last round is finally done, Fang and I make our way to the table.\n\nAs we walk back Fang picks up a sausage from the plate. \"Watch this,\" she throws it a few feet into the air and then triumphantly snatches it as it comes down with a chomp. The ravenous ptero raises her eyebrows while I can only think to be slightly concerned about what I just saw. And kind of aroused. We sit behind the table and begin to chow down. At first, we just eat normally, but as the others become distracted by the idea of a swim, we begin fooling around. It was kind of fun watching Fang snatch an ever-increasing number of meaty pieces out of the air. She had quite the talent. Eventually the I had nothing else to toss into the air for her. That's when I notice I just fed her all my stuff while her plate was still full. We reached an agreement, in exchange for some of hers, I had to give her a kiss for every piece. A bargain if I ever saw one. When we got to the last one, Fang paused for a bit. She really didn't like giving someone else the last piece of her food. After a while, when she was sure no one was looking, the ptero lunged at me, attaching her snoot to my lips. All I could do is grab onto her and hope we didn't fall off of the bench. After what seemed like a good minute she relented and cut the last piece in half. She let out a small laugh, \"You've earned it Anon,\" and pushed her plate towards me. \n\nAs I start going for my half I notice Naomi still sitting at the table. Were we really that distracted to not notice her? \n\n\"Don't mind me guys, just pretend I'm not here,\" her voice chipper as always, \"Although I do expect a thank you basket or at least an invitation to your wedding.\"\n\nFang nearly choked on her beer, \"W-what?\"\n\n\"I mean, it's the least you could do. As thanks for getting you two lovebirds together,\" Naomi still thought of herself as some sort of Machiavellian matchmaker. Fang wasn't taking it well. Without my hand to crush into paste she had no outlet for her frustration. \n\n\"You barely did anything you condescending little bi-,\" out of nowhere came Reed\n\n\"Ladies, ladies, calm down. We're here to chillax,\" a quick round of finger-guns he continues, \"But, if you two really want to settle something, may I suggest water wrestling?\"\n\n\"Wha-\", it's like the three of us became a hivemind.\n\n\"You already have teams and everything. It'll also be a good show for the rest of us,\" Reed turns around and heads back to the others. Fang thinks about it for a few seconds before coming to a decision. \n\"Fine, if me and Anon win, I'm right and your meddling mattered fuck all,\" she eager to fight Naomi. Guess that slap on prom night wasn't enough.\n\n\"And if Naser and I win, I get a fruit baster and you have to admit I was the main reason you two are in a relationship possible in the first place,\" I wasn't surprised Naomi wanted to take all the credit, even if I disagreed with her logic. The two girls didn't even shake hands before grabbing their respective boyfriends and going to prepare. The match was on.\n\nI'm dragged a little ways away from the group by my furious ptero girlfriend. Eventually, she decides it's far enough for whatever she has in mind.\n\"Anon, listen, we have to win this. I'm not admitting she had any significant part in our relationship. All I need from you is to not get knocked out by the fucked-wing retard. I bet that skank is promising him god knows what if they win,\" Fang paused for a bit and shudders. \"I know I can take her down, problem is Naser can take you out with one good hit,\" that was unfortunately true, Naser had a major height and strength advantage over me. \"So I'm calling in all the favors you owe me, we win and consider them fulfilled,\" suddenly Fang grabs me and pulls me really close starts whispering into my ear, \"I'll make it worth your while, I promise Anon.\" Her voice gets breathy and seductive, \"I'll let you do anything you want, you can even tug my tail.\" She suddenly let's go and gets out her phone. Fang taps in her password and finds an image, \"I'll even wear this,\" she turns the phone to shows me, \"I wanted it to be a surprise, but you're going to need a lot of motivation to withstand Nasers' beatings.\" It's a selfie in front of a large mirror. In the picture Fang isn't wearing her usual attire, she isn't even naked as much as I'd have loved to see that. Instead, she's wearing fishnet stockings, a tight leotard, and a bow tied around her neck. I had to grab onto the nearest tree before my legs gave out from under me. \nI was beyond motivated after seeing that selfie and hearing all the promises Fang made. Naser was going to have to kill me if he wanted to win, I sure hope he doesn't. We make our way to the water to find out Reed has changed the music to something akin to a battle track from a shitty 90s game. Naser and Naomi were also approaching, unsurprisingly Naser had a complete look of determination on his face. Guess Fang was right. \nWe could see an angry Trish grilling Reed, \"What the hell did you do?\" \n\"I just made a suggestion to keep things from getting too heated,\" Reed gave the tiny triceratops a wry smile, \"Besides, you've said countless times you wanted to see Fang in action.\" Trish suddenly decided to become a chameleon and turn from mostly purple to mostly red. Reed notices both groups approaching and suddenly takes on the role of referee. \"I see our two teams are ready. The rules are simple, each girl fights the other while sitting on their boyfriends' shoulders. The first one in the water is the loser. If both of you fall at the same time, you fight until one submits. I want a good clean fight, so no biting, eye-gouging, or breaking bones.\" Shit, how bad was Reed expecting this to get?\n\nWe get in the water and Fang climbs up on my shoulders, thankfully she's light as a feather. The other pair gets ready as well. There can be some cheers heard from our 'spectators'. Stella is excited because it reminds her of one of the animes she's currently watching. Trish is one hundred percent on Team Fang and calling for Naomi to get her ass kicked. Rosa does not approve but does not try to stop it either, maybe the ordeal reminds her of Mexican wrestling in some weird way. As we approach each other, Reed produces the sound effect of a fight ring and shouts, \"Begin!\"\n\nBoth the girls instantly lunge at each other, mostly preventing trying to prevent the other from getting a good grip. Down at water level Naser just stares and me.\n\"Anon, bro, you know I wouldn't want to hurt you. Again. But you have to understand, people have to pay for the shit Naomi promised me.\" Jesus, what did the pink psycho say to him?\n\"I get it, I don't want to think about what exactly she promised you. It's not like I wasn't given some encouragement from Fang either,\" I try to stall hoping Fang wins before Naser decides to topple us both.\n\"What? What did she promise you?\", oh no, that just made him mad.\n\"Why don't you ask her?\", my smugness comes and goes in a flash, just as Naser goes from calm to pissed and lunges towards me.\n\"Anon, I swear to god, if you so much as...\", I steel myself, hoping that I buy my girl enough time before passing out from the beating I'm about to receive.  \nNasers' sudden movement must have caught Naomi by surprise. Fang finally manages to get a good grip on the cream czarina, one hand on her arm and the other on her bathing suits. She tosses her several feet away like it was nothing. It was impressive and a little scary how strong she was when angry. Naser crashed into me, too late to change the outcome of the match. What he does achieve is knocking Fang off balance for a moment. She starts falling forward until she grabs on to her bothers oversized crest to stop herself from falling into the water. Fang ends up being in a precarious position, practically sitting on my face. Thankfully Naser can't see and I don't have a wine glass nearby. Fang pushes against her brother to get back in an upright position and lets out a triumphant cry. \"Suck it bitch!\", she raises up both arms and basks in victory. \n\nAs we make our way out of the water, Trish runs up to Fang with a towel. \n\"That was amazing, you just yeeted the bitch like it was nothing,\" if I didn't know any better I'd thought Trish was more than just happy her friend won. \n\"Yeah, I didn't even get my wings wet. Good thing my precious boyfriend used that big brain of his to stall Naser,\" Fang grabs me with both her arms and wings and pulls me close. Her voice was low enough for only me to hear, \"I'm going to keep my promise when we get back to your place Anon, don't you worry.\" Fang gives a quick kiss and pulls away, I do my best to not start screaming 'It's happening' at the top of my lungs. \n\nThe rest of the day is uneventful, Fang grills the rest of the meat, much to everyone's delight. I spend my time helping her out, despite Fang claiming I didn't need to anymore. She even lets me be in charge for the last few pieces, it turned out pretty OK. The others go for a swim now that the creek is no longer an arena. Surprisingly Naomi doesn't hold a grudge and accepts the outcome. Naser on the other hand is crushed and spends a few hours sulking. I am desperate to ask what he was promised, but I know I'd regret finding out. As it starts getting late we decide to call it a day. We pick up our trash and throw it into the convenient bin nearby. When everything is packed and cleaned we say our goodbyes. The girls all hug each other, while the guys just do a quick fist bump. The road home in uneventful, apart from Naser still rushing through SkinRow to my apartment. \nAs we get out and say our goodbyes Naser shoots Fang a question, \"So, what am I supposed to tell dad? He's\n expecting you home today.\"\nFangs reply is casual, \"Just tell him I'm staying a few more days at Anons\"\nBoth I and Naser echo each other's thoughts, \"He knows?!\"\n\"Well yeah, why wouldn't he?\", Fang pops the trunk of the Nascar and takes out a bag I haven't seen before. \"Drive safe dickwing, \"she slams down the trunk and gives it a double-tap to let her brother know to beat it. \n\nWe make our way up to my shitty apartment, the cool night making it bearable again. As I turn the key I can't help but ask, \"So, what's in the bag? Extra changes of clothes?\" \nFang just laughs, \"You could say that.\"\n\"Don't tell me that's...\"\n\"Mmmhmmm\"\n\"And you just had that in your bothers' car the entire day?\"\n\"So?\"\n\"W-what if he saw\"\n\"Are you going to keep asking dumb questions or are you going to open up the door?\" We make our way inside, Fang heading towards the bathroom. She pauses for a bit before entering and gives me a look that can only be described as bedroom eyes. \"I hope you have plenty of juice in the fridge Anon, it's going to be a long night\""},"Hello Rock Bottom Prologue.txt":{"path":["Fang","Hello Rock Bottom Prologue.txt"],"text":"Title: Hello Rock Bottom\nStatus: On-going\nCharacters: Fang and Naser\nRating: SFW\nClassification: Series\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nHello Rock Bottom - 00. Prologue\n\nWell, it finally happened. I guess everyone's had enough of my shit, and now I'm on my way to some stone quarry town all the way out in the boonies. God damnit, they just couldn't handle one last year of me?! Whatever, Mom and Dad didn't even try to understand me, sending me away to some backwater shithole, saying it's about \"Facing the real world\", FUCK THAT! Naser and Naomi, the asshole know-it-all's, always in my business, I swear I saw that bitch smile as I was leaving... Rosa and Stella, just a waste of time... Trish and Reed, my band mates and true friends, they understood who we were and knew what we wanted to do! Even if sometimes-\n\nI'm cut off mid-thought as I'm nearly thrown out the car by someone's reckless driving, \"What the fuck! Are you trying to fit in with these hicks already?!\" I shout over the squealing tires, gripping whatever handles I can reach as I try desperately to keep myself planted.\n\nNaser is fully concentrated on the road, getting back into the right lane before he speaks, \"Sorry, si-eems, like the roads aren't as maintained-\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" I cut him off, \"Your car can't handle it out here?\" I taunt, still keeping myself semi-braced for another wild maneuver.\n\nHe takes a breath, gripping the wheel for a moment before slowing down to a reasonable speed, relaxing a bit with a sigh, \"I don't want to mess with these pot holes, who knows how deep they are! If I hit one, that's it! And do you know how long it would take for-\"\n\nI've already tuned him out as he continues on about boring shit, taking the opportunity to look around now that everything isn't a blur. It seems like I'm trading palm trees and the beach for a bunch pine trees and hills. It's not a very exciting view, but I'm not sure if I'll miss home much either. Friends aside, dealing with everyone else was a pain in the ass. I let out a dejected sigh and check my phone for the weather this week, and see my suspicions confirmed, that it's already colder here than at home. Ffffuck. I also noticed I've somehow missed a few texts from Trish and Reed.\n\nT \"Saw that loser driving you around.\" \"We still good to hang out later?\"\nR \"heyy, everythin good, dude?\"\nT \"What's going on?\" \"Your mom saying you aren't going to VH this year?\" \"WTF\"\nR \"u looked kinda down when the nascar went by\"\nT \"Rock Bottom?\" \"That's so far away!\" \"Are you going to come back?\"\nR \"trish texted sayin ur mom said that ur goin 2 sum other school?\"\nT \"What about the band?\" \"This is bullshit!\" \"Hello?\" \"Text back when you can, please...\"\nR \"bruh, thats a bummer, ngl tho, goin to miss u this year, hope u can visit\"\n\nI set my phone aside and rub my temples, goddamnit I don't want to think about this now. But, AUGH! I didn't want any of this shit to happen! Fucking Naomi, that silver-tongued bitch, she had a hand this, I know it! I let out a frustrated sigh and look out again, seeing that the hills and trees have gotten much closer now, and a sign that reads-\n\n\"Rock Bottom,\" Naser's voice interrupts this time, car slowing down even more now as we pull into the outer limits, \"Home of-\"\n\n\"A bunch of dumbass hill billies who still eat rocks for a living.\" I laughed, but I'm still very fucking furious, \"Why the fuck am I being moved out here? I didn't even do anything!\" I cross my arms and huff, gritting my teeth as I close my eyes.\n\nNaser is silent for a few moments, before letting out a defeated sigh, \"Spears found out that you and your band were the ones that spray painted the school.\" He squeezes the wheel again, \"Lu-ook. Fang. Mom and Dad didn't have a choice,\" He holds up a hand before I could try cutting him off again, \"You of all people should know how much of a hardass Spears is about beautification.\" He looks around at every sign, making unsure turns, before letting out a frustrated sigh.\n\n\"But why the fuck is it only me getting the boot?! It was the band's ideal!\" I can feel the familiar sting of tears forming in my eyes and turn away, putting up a pissed off front as best I can. \n\nHe manages to find a gas station to stop at, but even with nothing distracting him now, he takes his time finding the words, \"Because, Spears is very convinced you're the leader...\" he constantly clenches his grip on the wheel for a moment, \"and as such, he decided that your punishment should be more severe.\" When I think I have a moment to speak, he suddenly blurts out, \"Dad managed to talk him out of charging you all with vandalism.\" He just stares blankly ahead, tapping the wheel as he's unsure of what to say anymore. It was like he just said something he wasn't supposed to.\n\nI guess he did, because I couldn't find the words I had before. We sit in an awkward silence, my mind racing with so many thoughts, that just drown the rest of the world out.\n\nI'm eventually stirred from my thoughts by Naser snapping his fingers in front of me, \"Hey, you ok, Fang?\"\n\n\"Huh? What?\" I look around in a daze and see we're parked at mostly empty street with plain brick buildings on both sides.\n\nHe lets out an apprehensive sigh as he points to the building right next to me, \"I said, we're at your apartment. You need any help taking in-\"\n\n\"Fuck you, I got it.\" I've already opened the car door, and the trunk clicks open on cue. I barely manage to hold everything in both arms, making clear as day that I'm not coming back for a second trip.\n\nHe's gotten out to close the trunk, and calls out, \"Your room is on the top floor, by the way. Your number and keys are-\" \n\n\"I got them right here, dickwing!\" I shout back at him as I get to the entryway, fumbling with the door handle a bit.\n\nI look at his reflection on the window, and see him stand near the driver door, \"If you need anything else, you know what to do. We'll visit during winter break, I think.\" He starts anxiously tapping the roof, \"I, I'll miss y-\"\n\n\"You can leave anytime...!\" I make a flicking motion with my wings, and crack open the door a little. I just want a bed to fall into already, this day has gone on far too long.\n\nIt takes a moment before he finally retreats back into the driver seat, hearing the gears shift and engine roar as he pulls away. When I don't hear the piece of junk anymore, I let out an exhausted sigh, and drag everything I had through the doorway. I'm still lost in thought as I carry everything through the building, my world literally feels like it's on my shoulders by the time I enter my apartment. Finally setting everything down doesn't ease the burden, and as I carry my guitar case to the bedroom, I know don't even have the energy to play.\n\nI lay the case next to me as I crawl into bed, giving it a tight embrace as I finally let the tears out. God damnit, why am I like this? All I feel I can do now, is to sing some wordless melodies, apart of a song I hear when I get like this. That song is all that brings me peace anymore, letting me slowly drift off to sleep.\n\nThere's nowhere to go but up now, right...?","Title":"Hello Rock Bottom","Status":"On-going","Characters":"Fang and Naser","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"Series","Author":"Anonymous"},"IWTCIF - Sonic Heroes.txt":{"path":["Fang","IWTCIF - Sonic Heroes.txt"],"text":"Title: IWTCIF - Sonic Heroes\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nAlternate Title: Fucking Kill Me Please\n\n(Starts right after Fang vores Anon's lower face.)\n\nReinvigorated by our sloppy make out session, I begin my efforts of fucking her again, resulting in her moaning against my face and me groaning down her throat. My unga bunga caveman brain begins screaming at me once more. I LOVE PTEROS! I CRAVE PTEROS! \n\nI really should find these sorts of thoughts concerning,  but I'm not in a position to argue with my brain at the moment. There's more hormones than blood currently flowing through my veins, so I just weakly give in to my male instincts. I break my kiss with Fang as I grab hold of her legs, pushing them up and next to my head to give myself a better angle as I begin pounding into her even harder.\n\nI LOVE PTEROS! I CRAVE PTEROS! I'M PTERO FIEND! I'M PTERO-ING THIS PUSSY UP. These thoughts keep repeating through my head, but I know I'm not mumbling again this time. Instead, I'm just making autistic chimpanzee noises, which causes my goth lover to give me a look of growing concern. My hip thrusting becomes frantic at this point, reaching super sonic speeds that I'm sure are going to give my dick friction burns, even with Fang's girl juices coating it. \n\nShe's not even looking at me anymore, her head turned to the side and buried in her hands in complete and utter embarrassment. I know she's enjoying it though as I feel her legs shaking in my hands, as well as a fanning of my butt from the fast pace her tail is wagging. The thought of her orgasming is more than enough to also topple me over the edge as well.\n\n I feel something travel up and down the length of my shaft. My legs firmly plant themselves on the carpet. I bury myself into Fang's vagina one more time, my world spinning as I let out a mighty torrential storm of semen deep inside her. In between my massive loads,  my sex-addled brain tries to think of something catchy to top this moment off with. I immediately think of my childhood, and the mediocre game I spent the most time playing. For some reason, I think it's a good idea to scream it to the world.\n\n\"SONIC HEROOOES!\" The volume I shout this at feels like I'm ripping my vocal chords, and my partner simply looks up at me in complete horror. \"SOOONIIIC HEEEEEEROOOOOOES!!!\" I yell it even louder now, black splotches covering my vision as I feel myself slipping into darkness. \"Sooonic-\"...\n\nMy eyes suddenly jolt open as I look around. I'm back in my bed, sans my girlfriend, and I slowly lift my sore body up as I prepare to go and look for her. I don't don't even have to leave my blanket though, as I realize she's currently sitting at the edge of my bed and next to the night stand. My nose picks up the smell of flavored tobacco, and I finally realize what she's doing.\n\nShamefully I crawl over my flimsy mattress to join Fang, my legs now dangling off the edge of the bed frame and next to hers.  She knows I'm there, as she's quick to extend a wing around my back like a consoling arm. Outside of that though, she doesn't do anything else to acknowledge me. She instead focuses on finishing her menthol first, dumping the ashes in a glass of water after every large puff before also dumping the butt in.\n\n\"So.\" Breaking the silence, the pterodactyl finally speaks up. At the very least, she doesn't sound very angry. Just tired. Her head isn't still facing me, but I can tell now that she's looking at me with her peripheral vision. \"What the hell is Sonic Heroes?\". I silently mouth a string of profanities and curse my luck. I have a lot of explaining to do...\n\nNote From Archiveanon: I am going to personally kill you bruh. My fucking sides reached oblivion and now i am suffering lmao.

To be actually translated from the Sacred Schizo Texts at a later date. Maybe\n\n\nDesperate to break the tension and silence the tiny voice in the back of my head telling me to plow this fertile and unclaimed land for myself, I practically throw myself onto Fang, wedging my head between her beak and what one could generously call a chest as I passionately suck and kiss her sweat drenched throat. Honestly, I don't know what I'm thinking, I've seen this maneuver in my Chinese Smut Cartoons, but doing it for real just makes me feel like a retarded vampire. \n\nRetarded or not, my rookie attempts seem to be having some effect on her, my hot ptero gee eef letting out a weird sultry hiss as she throws back her head, her tail loudly thumping against my bed at speeds previously not possible. A part of my mind suspects she's more getting off to the moment than my technique, but my thoughts are cut short as Fang lets herself fall back into the bed, taking me with her as her wings help to cushion the fall.\n\n\"Hey. You're pretty good.\" Her voice is deep and husky as her hands begin exploring my body, one rubbing my skeleton chest while the other snakes down into my pajama pants. I raise a brow, my hands now doing a bit of exploration of their own, undoing the buttons on her dress shirt. \"Really?\" I try to hide my surprise, doing my best to sound disinterested.\n\nFang gives me the biggest shit-eating grin, her hand in my pants sliding past my engorged member and cupping around my balls.... Wait. \"Yeah, for a loser virgin.\". Before I can tell her to be careful, she squeezes on my jewels so hard that I fear her nails will puncture my scrotum. Luckily that doesn't happen, but I still let out an extremely pitiful cry, completely collapsing onto my dino lover as the bravado she displayed dissolves into genuine shock and horror.\n\n\"Oh my God! Oh fuck! Anon? ANON?! ANON!!!\" I can hear her panicked voice calling out to me, but it's too late. I'm fading. My vision blurs, my grip consciousness fades, and I begin reminiscing about my life... Ok, not really, but I really fucking wish that was happening. Since it isn't though, I finally pull myself up and weakly guide the hand in my pants away from my nuts and towards my thankfully still hard dick.\n\n\"Who's the loser virgin now?\" there's a crack in my voice, and Fang's only reply is to nervously laugh as she wraps her fingers around my peanus weanus. She's a lot more gentle this time, perhaps a bit too gentle, but the feel of her sweaty palms against my meat stick feels really good regardless. As she continues figuring that out, I return to her chest, eager to touch boobies for the first time in my life.\n\nMy fingers slipping into her shirt now, I feel up her midriff and eventually find their prize. Honestly, calling them a prize is a bit of a stretch, they're nice and firm for sure, but they barely fill my tiny baby hands. God, her fucking titties are small as hell. The grip on my penis becomes dangerously tight all of a sudden, and I bite my traitorous tongue in realization. \n\nIn fear that my words will continue to betray me, I just continue what I was doing, tracing circles around her dino \"\"milkies\"\" in a desperate attempt to come off as romantic. As my fingertips close in and aim to pinch her nipples though, I feel something warm and metallic. I already have an idea what it is, but peeling her shirt further open confirms my suspicion. Tiny barbells pierce her grayish blue nipples. They're the exact kind of thing you'd expect a girl who's trying to emulate a goth punker bitch to have, but I can't help but audibly snicker a bit.\n\nFeeling Fang's killing intent flare from that, I aim to quell it by flicking her piercing one last time before burying my face into her chest, taking a deep sniff before my mouth takes in one of her teats. Seemingly appreciating it, she places a hand on the back of my freakishly bald head and speeds up her ministrations on my pole. Honestly, she fucking sucks at giving a handy so far, but much like her, I'm getting off to the current situation and hormones.\n\nThe next few minutes are like this, each of us getting used to each other's bodies in preparation for what's to come. While I'd like to think that what we're doing is erotic, my mind keeps telling me that what we're doing is only a half a step up from useless humping. Eventually though, Fang pushes me away, her hand leaving my trousers as she reaches towards her panties.\n\n\"Get up for a second.\" Her voice is commanding, and I quickly comply, standing up as she begins sliding her underwear off. While she's doing that, I take the time to remove my own pants, my massive schmeat standing erect in the cool air. I expected Fang to have some sort of reaction to my endowment, but the only thing she does is eye it before throwing up her balled up undergarments at my face. My ego damaged, I decide to tank the thrown clothing, the piece of fabric hitting my face with a loud 'plorp'.\n\nOh. Oh sweet Raptor Jesus it's so fucking wet. How can it be this wet? I peel the article off my face, tossing it onto the floor as I begin wiping my face off with my shirt. \"We can skip the rest of the For Her Pleasure' shit.\". A part of me is disappointed that I don't get to eat dino pussy, while the other part of me is glad to skip further humiliation. She beckons me with a clawed finger to join her again, and I waste absolutely zero time, striding up back to the bed as I take a look at her exposed nethers.\n\nThey're the same color as her nipples, which isn't that much of a shock. Definitely wetter though. The real sticker for me though is the patch of downy feathers where a mound of pubic hair would be. She doesn't shave? Well, how the fuck would she? You can't shave feathers. Can you?\n\nAs I'm pondering about a cleanly shaven Fang, she briefly grabs my hand and yanks me even closer towards her. I'm now standing between two spread legs as she lays back in the bed, one elbow propping herself slightly up as the other one impatiently lining up my penis with her entrance. The alarms I haven't heard since my time in high school make themselves known again. I wish they stayed left at high school, man they're loud.\n\n\"Anon, I swear to God if you don't stop mumbling stupid shit and get on with it, not even estrus is gonna save this farce of a session.\" It's really hard to tell just how pissed she is with how low her voice is right now, but I just nod in agreement. I reach out and hold onto her waist, my hands struggling to clasp on from the combination of slick scales and sweat.\n\nI thrust and groan, my johnson sliding up and over her hole, uselessly grinding against it as it completely misses its mark. Fang let out a moan followed by an angry squawk. \"I swear to fu-\" In the middle of her complaining, I had already lined up for a second attempt, this time pushing myself in. I'm met with the barest amount of token resistance from her gash, followed by an almost uncomfortable amount of heat and tightness around my schlong.\n\nFang's wings slightly flare out underneath her and her mouth opens to show rows of needle sharp teeth. She produces no noise, but I'm able to guess that she's probably in pain. Concerned, I begin pulling out, only to have her legs wrap firmly around my midsection to pull me back in. Brought back into the depths into her folds, she lets out a groan this time, her legs tensing and letting me go. I take this as my actual chance to escape and let her recover a bit, but my second try is met with the same result, and she locks her legs around me again and brings me back.\n\n\nFinally catching on, I stop trying to escape my ptero pussy prison, instead slowly grinding myself in and out in an attempt to help Fang get used to this. Pained groans quickly turn to stifled moans, and her tail starts thumping to the beat of my thrusts as I begin to pick up the pace. Between the moans and cries, she cries for me to go faster, and I simply brace myself and silently apologize to my bed for what's about to happen.\n\nMy box spring lets out a noise of protest as my hips slam into Fang's, my hyper weapon thrusting into her breeding hole over and over at intense speed. Pale legs wrap lightly around my noodly waist every time I plunge as if begging me not to leave, and the soft moans and gasps she was making earlier have been replaced with deafening screams of joy.\n\nThe sounds of our union however, are almost drowned out by my need to breed, the quiet voice in my head from way earlier coming back in full force, now a primal growl that repeats in my head over and over. I WANT TO CUM INSIDE FANG! PTERO PUSSY IS THE BEST! PTERO PUSSY IS THE GREATEST!\n\nI'm suddenly snapped back into reality as I feel a fist slam against my chest. Fucking ow. My pistoning hips grind to a halt, and when I look back at Fang, I realize her face is a mixture of both annoyance, anger, and embarrassment. It takes me a moment to realize why, and I'm suddenly hit with a wave of shame that hurts harder than any bollard could.\n\nFang, looking away from me now, just mumbles \"You done now?\". I blew it, didn't I? Even if it's estrus season, there's no way I just didn't completely kill the mood. I laugh awkwardly, trying to pull out \"Yeah, sorry I-\". I'm cut off short as her legs lock around me and force me back in, causing me to groan. \n\nClawed fingers reach out and grab my head firmly, Fang now staring into my eyes with those amber orbs of hers. \"I didn't tell you to stop, dweeb. I just want you to shut the fuck up.\" Despite the harshness of the spoken words, her voice is anything but. She pulls me into a kiss, her massive snoot opening up to consume my entire lower face as we begin sucking on each other's tongues.\n\nReinvigorated by our sloppy make out session, I begin my efforts of fucking her again, resulting in her moaning against my face and me groaning down her throat. My unga bunga caveman brain begins screaming at me once more. Fuck her deeper. Harder. And a whole bunch of other shit that I'm sure it stole from the copious amounts of illegally acquired doujins I've read.\n\nI really am not in a position to argue with my brain at the moment though, more hormones than blood currently flowing through my veins, so I oblige. I break my kiss with Fang as I grab hold of her legs, pushing them up and next to my head to give myself a better angle as I begin pounding into her even harder.\n\nThe sing song screams of ecstasy from earlier are back in full force from my gee eff now as my hips become little more than a blur, the sound of my balls slapping joining her in our weird fuck session. I feel her legs start to tremble, and in a desperate attempt to bring me back into some sort of kiss she reaches her tip of the beak up to smash into my lips.\n\nI'm not sure if she climaxed, but the mere thought that I might have achieved the impossible for a first time virgin is enough to push me over the edge. I hilt myself as far as I can go, nutting so hard that I swear there's black spots in my vision.\n\nWe're both locked in the same position for what seems like eternity, unmoving as our lusts die down. And as soon as they do, I collapse completely on top of Fang, her wings now wrapping around me like a blanket.This is probably the best part of all of this outside of the sex.\n\nI close my eyes for a few minutes, resting and trying to recover whatever stamina I have for the second round that's to come. When I start hearing her snoring though, I suddenly realize that everything I read about estrus season on a Serbian Kebab Removal IRC was probably a meme. Figures. I let out a sigh, before letting my exhaustion claim me as well...","Title":"IWTCIF","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Little Lucy.txt":{"path":["Fang","Little Lucy.txt"],"text":"Title: Little Lucy\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Pshy\nSummary: Anon experiences the joys of fatherhood\n\n\n>The clash of blades echoed throughout the yard\n>Your opponent was skilled, fierce and ferocious\n>\"Give tweasure!\" your tiny assailant squeaks, holding her wooden sword in two hands\n>You've never seen your daughter look this determined before\n>At least, not without cookies being involved\n>You place a free hand on your hip and bellow a hearty laugh\n>\"Ha!

Bare to the wait, they faced each other across that hot tiled roof, their faces mirror images of each other. Despite their facial similarities, their bodies were different: One bore the heavy musculature of a man accustomed to combat, heavy white scars of battle crisscrossing his broad arms. The other man had honed his physique at his trusty neighborhood gym, the little time he could get access to the squat rack leaving him with plenty of functional strength. In another life, another time, they could be brothers: But now, they were enemies. \nThey stood several feet apart, neither having said a word since the other had shown up for their destined meeting. They knew that only one of them could be right, that there was only one correct answer to their question. Both were adamant that their way was correct, that the other couldn\u2019t be more wrong, and each was ready to defend their beliefs to the death. As the sun set, they were going to settle things in a way only two men could. \nNether man made a move, each waiting for the other to show his hand first. They stared at each other, pointedly ignoring the large hole in the fence encircling the roof. To look at that would be to admit that one of their brothers had failed, that another one of these pale clones had done the unspeakable. No, to them, there were only two options, and only one way off the roof.\nAnother howling gale causes the men to grit their teeth, the sand scourging both sets of eyes, causing them to water slightly. No other explanation could be given for why their eyes were cloudy with tears, of course; at least, none that these two men would admit. As the wind died down, each sensed the time was neigh, and both began to move, a silent circle of testosterone. \n\u201cFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG!\u201d The battle-scarred man screamed, keeping his arms to his side as he squared his shoulders, blowing his chest out to emphasize his point. \n\u201cLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCY!\u201d The other cried, just as loud as his brother, his hands rising above his head, palms-first, his elbows close to his waist. \nSuddenly the peace of the evening was shattered as the men flew at each other, landing blow after blow. Soon, the rooftop was stained with blood and sweat, each man fighting not just for his life, but what his life represented. It was a colossal battle of wills, two immovable objects coming face to face, neither one willing to yield, neither one willing to justify the other. \n\u201cMy god, they are such dweebs,\u201d Fang said, sitting on top of the rooftop that was raised above the rest, clad in her brown turtleneck and black jeans. \n\u201cSeriously,\u201d said Lucy, her yellow sun dress and red ribbion fluttering in the errant breeze.\n\u201cHey, play the song, guys.\u201d One Anon had the other in a headlock, muffling cries of \u201csplendid brother\u201d still audible above the choking. They had stopped fighting, quickly realizing there was no music playing.\nThe ptero-wives rolled their eyes, Lucy dragging the portable boombox over to them as Fang pressed the \u201cOn\u201d switch. \n\n\u2018What a thrill\u2026\u2019","Title":"Metal Snoot Solid 4 - Autism of The Patriots","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Roomba on your Grave.txt":{"path":["Fang","Roomba on your Grave.txt"],"text":"Title: Roomba on Your Grave \nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 5 years since you recognized me, a chance encounter at a liquor store on the corner of Skin Row.

The graded midterm exam from Math class still mocks me from where I stuffed it into my backpack. That giant red \"D+\" Mr Delewski literally stamped in bold red ink is still fresh in my memory. Midterms were last Friday, and I bet it was an intentional cruelty to make everyone wait until Monday for the results. Things were already looking about as bad as I feared. Math was a complete wash, I only barely skated by English, and I only avoided disaster in music thanks to Fang's impromptu guitar lesson. Hopefully science would end the day on a high note and even things out. It was the one subject I actually had some confidence in.\n\nFang walked in just as the final bell rings, along with the rest of the stragglers in class. She takes her seat next to me without a word, crossing her arms over her stomach. Normally she would at least say hello or something, it doesn't take a genius to see she's nervous. I know science isn't her strong suit, but it's not like her to get nervous about a test result. She must have done even worse than I thought. Before I can think of something to say to Fang, Dr. Fernsworth takes his place behind his desk. The thick stack of papers he drops on the desk echoes like a guillotine throughout the classroom, everyone quickly falling deathly silent. He takes a moment to adjust his ridiculously thick glasses and clears his throat.\n\n\"Alright everyone, your exams have all been graded.\" He announces, a little unnecessarily. I doubt anyone couldn't have figured that out. \"I'll hand them back in alphabetical order. Please come up an collect your exam when I call your name.\"\nAs usual, my name is called first. Fernsworth gives me a small smile as I collect the packet and read my score. Eighty-five out of a hundred, a solid \"B\". Pretty good, honestly. Fernsworth's tests are notorious around campus, so I'm not disappointed with a \"B\" in my best class. When I sit back down next to Fang, she immediately looks over my shoulder to read my score.\n\n\"You got a 'B'?\" She asks, sounding a little surprised, \"I thought you'd get an 'A'...\"\n\n\"Yeah, well I didn't get to study as much an I wanted.\" I reply, instantly realizing how badly I stuck my foot in my mouth. \"Not that I regret hanging out with you or anything! I mean, I only passed music because-\"\n\n\"Hey, can I see your exam?\" Fang asks, ignoring the verbal spaghetti coming out of my mouth. I hand the packet over to her, happy to sidestep whatever embarrassing thing I was about to say next. Fang must be really impatient about all this, her name is about to come up soon anyway. She flips the pages back and forth, skimming over my answers. Judging by her expression, she doesn't like what she sees. Her grip is actually starting to crinkle the paper a little, and she's so focused she doesn't even hear Fernsworth call her name the first time.\n\n\"Fang!\" He repeats himself, finally getting her attention, \"Please come up and collect your exam.\"\n\nFang marches briskly up to Fernsworth's desk, snatching back her exam with a scowl. Fernsworth kept the exam face down when he handed it back, but I can see the red ink staining the back of the pages from here. Fang barely glances at the front as she walks back before she angrily stuffs it into her backpack, not even bothering to look through it. Fang quietly growls in anger as she sits next to me, her fingers drumming hard against the table. Talking to her now might not be the best idea, especially considering how well I did on the test. I'll give her some time to simmer down before I try to approach her.\n\nFernsworth steadily hands back the rest of the class, each student either subtly groaning in disappointment or sighing in stressed relief. A quite murmur of conversation grows as everyone starts comparing scores, debating answers, or bemoaning their ruined GPA. After Fersworth hands back the last test, he adjusts his lab-coat and clears his throat. Stepping in front of his desk, he taps the surface with a ruler to get everyone's attention.\n\n\"Now then, I know this exam was quite a bit harder than the rest of your classes.\" He begins, with what feels like the understatement of the semester, \"I know many of you aren't happy with your current grades. For students who want to improve their scores, I have good news! As extra credit you may submit an additional science project, along with a minimum five page essay, due no later than next Monday.\"\n\nSeveral students groan audibly, dismayed at both the size requirement and the tight deadline. I can't help but agree with them. An entire project, and essay, due by next week? No chance in hell I'm putting myself through that, even if I had needed the help. From the sound of it though, some people might not have much of a choice in the matter. I turn to gauge Fang's reaction, but it looks like she's too busy staring out the window to pay much attention to Fernsworth's offer.\n\nAs usual, I decide to crash in the auditorium after school with the Fang Gang. It's not like I have anything better to do, I can shitpost perfectly fine on my phone while the band practices. Honestly 'practice' might be a bit of a strong word for it. Half the time we just talk shit and hang out, laughing at Reed's ridiculous song lyrics or just passing the usual campus gossip. Trish has begrudgingly accepted my presence by now, even if she still routinely insists I'm 'distracting' Fang from practice. For now though, the band is actually playing. They've been trying to get through one of Reed's new songs for some time now, and even I can tell they're having a rough time of it. They've had to restart more times than I can count, everyone keeps falling out of tempo with each other. Fang is visibly frustrated, Trish is losing her patience, and even Reed's chill attitude is starting to show it's edges. Finally after yet another false start, Trish unslings her bass in frustration.\n\n\"Fang, what is with you today?\" Trish groans, throwing her head back, \"That's the fifth time you were late coming in! Are you even paying attention?\"\n\n\"Shut up Trish.\" Fang snarls, her wings starting to fan out aggressively, \"I don't need more shit to deal with today.\"\n\n\"Woah, hey, c'mon guys.\" Reed holds up his hands defensively, trying to curtail the impending shouting match, \"Let's just take a breather, you know? Just chill out and-\"\n\n\"We can't just take breaks all the time!\" Trish retorts, rounding on Reed, \"We need to be perfect for our next show!\"\n\n\"What next show?\" Fang mumbles, looking down morosely at her guitar. That seems to snap Trish out of her tirade, as both she and Reed suddenly look very worried.\n\n\"Fang? What do you mean by that?\" Trish asks, her anger evaporating in an instant. Fang visibly cringes, her hands subconsciously drifting to her wings as they pull close.\n\n\"My Dad said I can't play in the band anymore if I fail my midterms,\" Fang explains, her eyes locked on the floor, \"and I totally bombed Fernsworth's test last week.\"\n\n\"H-He can't do that!\" Trish shouts, clearly in denial. I can't help but imagine Trish angrily standing up to Ripley, and there's just no way that works out well. No amount of chutzpah can compete with that mountain of homicidal pteradon. Trish shakes her head, clenching her fists at her sides. \"No, the band is too important. He can't just make you quit!\"\n\n\"Well what do you want me to do about it?\" Fang asks, exasperated, \"I can't just sneak out every night!\"\n\n\"Yes you can!\" Trish retorts, getting desperate, \"He can't control your life! We could skip class or-\"\n\n\"What about the extra credit project?\" I blurt out, interrupting Trish's tirade. I haven't thought any of this through, I just said the first thing that had popped into my head. Now that I have everyone's attention, I just roll with it and hope for the best. \"Maybe your Dad will ease off if you bump up your grade?\"\n\n\"Heyyyyy that's a great idea Anon.\" Reed shoots me some finger guns, \"Fang just needs to throw together a paper volcano or something, and it's all good!\"\n\n\"It's not that easy, Fernsworth's a total hard-ass.\" Fang groans, \"He wants a real project and everything, including a paper. I'd have to work like crazy all week.\"\n\n\"You don't have time for that!\" Trish protests, \"We need to keep practicing for our next show!\"\n\n\"I didn't even say I was going to do it!\" Fang snaps back, \"Besides, does anybody have a better idea?\"\n\nTrish looks like she's about to say anything, but stops, staring angrily at the floor. Reed just scratches the back of his head and stays silent, unwilling to speak up at all. I keep my mouth shut as well. Despite Fang's reluctance, it seems like she already came to a decision.\n\n\"Fine then, I'm done with practice today.\" Fang announces, stowing her guitar back in it's case. Grabs her own bass case with a huff, glaring at me the entire time, as if this whole situation is somehow my fault. Reed just grabs his thermos and takes several big swigs, clearly intending to clock out for the rest of the afternoon. The mood in the room is pretty much ruined at this point, so I take the opportunity to bounce. I wave goodbye to Fang and Reed and head home, mentally debating on what I want to microwave for dinner tonight.\n\nLater that night, I'm awoken by the sound of my phone vibrating on the nightstand. Groaning in annoyance, I blindly flail my hand over until it slaps against the plastic case. I fumble with the power cord and the home button, blidning myself with the screen brightness as it turns on. Cursing and blinking my eyes clear, I squint at the new notifications. Looks like Fang has been texting me.\n\nF: \"Hey dork. You up?\"\nF: \"My Dad said he'll lay off me if I do the project. I can't think of a topic though.\"\nF: \"You have any stupid ideas?\"\n\nSleep deprived, I immediately type back the first thing on my mind\n\n> A: \"Fang, it's 2am. I was asleep.\"\n\nImmediately after I hit send, I regret it. If Fang is still up this late, she must have been stressing about the project pretty bad. Rubbing my stinging eyes, I quickly type another message.\n\n> A: \"Yeah, sure. Let's meet up tomorrow. I'll try to think of something.\"\n\nI turn the phone on silent and toss it back on the nightstand, blinking the afterimages out of my eyes. Hopefully I haven't woken up completely, and I can get back to sleep quickly.\n\nThe next morning I sleepily trudge to school, stifling yet another yawn. Climbing out of bed had been an absolute chore today, and I can tell I'll be fighting sleep all day. As I groggily climb the front steps of the school, I spot Fang waiting for me by the doors. Shit, that's right, I was supposed to help think of project ideas.\n\n\"Hey Anon. Damn, you look like shit today.\" Fang grins as I groan in response. I push the front door open with my shoulder and head for my locker, Fang taking up stride beside me. There's already plenty of other students in the halls digging through their lockers or grouchily nursing cups of coffee\n\n\"So...\" Fang begins, leaning against the locker next to mine while I spin the lock, \"Did you come up with anything for the project?\"\n\nI hesitate, taking my time collecting my textbooks and binders. I hadn't come up with any ideas since Fang's texts last night, but now that I think about it, should I? This is supposed to be her project, I can't just do it for her. Besides the fact Fernsworth would immediately notice and likely fail her, I just shouldn't patronize Fang like that. She's smarter than she thinks, I'm sure she can pull this off on her own.\n\n\"I don't know, another railgun is probably a bad idea.\" I begin, Fang chuckling as she remembers that particular disaster.\n\n\"Yeah, I think Fernsworth is still a little mad about the window.\" Fang agrees as I sling my backpack back over my shoulder, \"Seriously though, no ideas? I'm totally stumped here.\"\n\nShe hits me those big pleading eyes, and I feel my willpower begin to crumble. No, stay strong Anon! This is for her own good, she can do this! I must resist those beautiful golden eyes! Fang softly flutters those big eyelashes, and I realize I never stood a chance to begin with.\n\n\"Well...\" I concede, scrambling for an idea, \"What if you built something cool and wrote the paper about that? I don't think Fernsworth is that picky about the topic, as long as you don't half-ass it.\"\n\n\"The only thing I can do with a hammer is smash stuff.\" Fang pouts, \"Naser was the one who got all the handyman lessons from Dad.\" She actually sounds a little envious, she must have thought about this before.\n\n\"Trust me, holding the flashlight isn't as fun as it sounds.\" I reply, following Fang to her first class, \"Listen, I'll catch you at lunch. If you don't think of anything before then, I'm sure someone will have an idea. Sound good?\"\n\n\"Yeah, alright.\" Fang fist-bumps me with a weary smile, waving goodbye as we part ways in the hall. I head for first period English, hoping Jin won't catch me sleeping in the back of class again.\n\nLunch period eventually arrives, and by now I feel much better. It's amazing what a few power-naps and the promise of food can do to perk somebody up. Fang is already at the usual table, along with the rest of the gang. Reed gives me his usual \"Sup\" in greeting as I sit down, while Trish tries for the hundredth time to murder me with her eyes. Fang looks lost in thought, staring off into space as she taps her fork against the table in an improvised beat.\n\n\"Hey Fang, did you think of anything?\" I ask, snapping her out of her own head.\n\n\"Actually, yeah. I think so.\" Fang smiles, Reed and Trish turning their attention toward her. \"I think I'm going to try to build an electric guitar.\"\n\n\"Damn, really?\" I ask, more than a little skeptical at the idea. I don't really know anything about electric guitars, or what went into building one, but I had the distinct impression it would be difficult. \n\n\"Obviously not from scratch,\" Fang explains, tapping the table with her fork again, \"If I find some spare parts and just assemble them, it shouldn't be too hard. I can write the paper about the wiring, sound waves, and the other technical junk. That should be enough for a project, right?\"\n\n\"You're going to need a soldering iron.\" Reed chimes in, counting on his fingers, \"Not to mention pickups, potentiometers, capacitors, and that's just the electrical. You might have to do a vintage wiring assembly if the parts are too old for- what?\"\n\nEveryone is just staring at Reed, wondering where the heck all that just came from. I know Reed does all the electrical work for the band, but I didn't expect that level of technical jargon from him. Once again I'm left wondering just what else is hiding behind that stoned dude-bro personality of his.\n\n\"Yeah, I'll need all that stuff.\" Fang agrees, looking a little unsure of herself now, \"I'll also need a place to work, I don't think I can do this on my desk at home. Any ideas?\"\n\n\"I think the shop class has a couple soldering guns.\" I answer, thinking back to the few times I walked by that rarely used classroom, \"There's probably some other stuff in there we can use.\"\n\n\"So you'll help?\" Fang asks hopefully, and I realize I had just committed myself. I nod in agreement along with Reed, who as usual seems perfectly fine with whatever the newest crazy scheme is.\n\n\"I still say this is a waste of time.\" Trish objects, crossing her arms. \"Let's just keep practicing after school and you can tell your dad you're working on your project. He'll forget about all this eventually.\"\n\n\"Then you clearly don't know my dad.\" Fang scowls, \"He's watching me like a hawk. He's not just going to let this drop.\"\n\n\"We'll probably have to ask the shop teacher to use the classroom.\" I interject, cutting Trish off before she can start another argument. \"Who's the shop teacher anyway?\"\n\n\"Mr. Delewski.\" Reed answers, much to my disappointment. Of course that slob would be the school shop teacher. Getting him to look up from his magazines would be hard enough, convincing him to do any kind of favor would be near impossible.\n\nThe lunch bell rings before I can reply, startling everyone at the table. The four of us quickly stand up while shoveling down the remnants of our neglected lunches. Discarding our empty trays, we split up in the hall and head to our next classes. Science was next, so Fang and I walk together to Fernsworth's classroom. \n\n\"Hey Anon,\" Fang stops me outside the door, \"You mind coming with me to see Delewski after school? He might cave more easily if there's two of us.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure.\" I agree. I've already learned my lesson today about trying to deny her. I just don't have the willpower to compete with those pleading eyes.\n\n\"Thanks dork.\" Fang pulls me into a tight hug, my face immediately burning up. It only lasts a moment, Fang must have remembered we're in a crowded hallway, so she quickly shoves me away and practically runs into the classroom. I take a moment to collect myself, painfully aware of the several students looking in my direction. Hopefully that won't start any rumors, but I know better than to expect otherwise.\n\n\nAs the last bell rings for the day, I work my way against the river of students heading for the front doors. Finally squeezing past the last of the crowd, I head for Mr. Delewski's classroom. Hopefully he's actually still here, and didn't somehow leave campus before everyone else. Fang is waiting for me outside his door, leaning against the lockers. She nods towards the door as I walk up, opening it and heading in.\n\nIt seems Mr. Delewski's desire to go home had been outweighed by his sheer laziness. He's already asleep at his desk, snoring loudly with a magazine draped over his face. Now that I think about it, maybe he just lives in here, eating in the cafeteria and showering in the gym. It honestly isn't that far-fetched.\n\nFang clears her throat once, then twice, but Mr Delewski just keeps snoring. Realizing that something subtle won't work, Fang snatches the magazine from his face and immediately drops it in disgust. God, that damn thing looks a little crusty. Fang angrily wipes her hand on her jeans, debating her next move. She leans in to poke Delewski with her finger, hesitates for a moment, then jabs him hard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Huh? Whazza-?\" Mr Delewski sputters, jolting upright in his seat, \"I swear I didn't- oh, it's just yous twos.\" He hastily brushes the crumbs off his chest and wipes off his face, pulling together at least a thin fa\u00e7ade of professionalism. Delewski folds his hands on the desk, looking between the two of us suspiciously.\n\n\"Now Anon,\" He begins, settling on me, \"I thought I told you I don't do any of that whole 'extra credit' nonsense. If you want to pull your grade outta the trash barrel, you gotta put the work in. Or at least, you know, pass over at least three figures.\"\n\nAn awkward silence hangs in the air as I try to figure out of he's serious. \n\n\"Ha ha ha! I'm just yanking your chain here!\" Delewski laughs nervously, sweat visible on his forehead, \"Although if you were down for that, I would not be opposed. Moe will, and I say this literally, break my arms next week if I don't pay him.\"\n\n\"No, uh... we just need a favor.\" I explain, trying not to think too much about what I just heard. I nudge Fang in the side, breaking her out of her stunned silence.\n\n\"Yeah, right.\" Fang composes herself, \"We need to use the shop class after school for Fernsworth's science project.\"\n\n\"Uh huh, yeah. Sure you do.\" Delewski replies, already bored, \"And uh... what does this have to do with me?\"\n\n\"You're...the shop teacher?\" I awkwardly answer. Delewski just keeps staring at me, so I press on, \"I think we need your permission or something?\"\n\n\"Yeah, you do.\" Delewski replies sternly, \"And I don't feel like giving it, so there.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Fang asks angrily,  \"I said it's for a school project!\"\n\n\"Because I am a respectable fauciltor of this educating institution.\" Delewski answers, \"That means I don't just hand out my friggin' keys to anybody who asks!\"\n\n\"It's. for. a. project.\" Fang repeats, visibly losing her patience. I can see the feathers on her wings begin to puff out, she's close to snapping.\n\n\"Come on, this is important.\" I plead, getting desperate. \"What do we need to do for this to work?\"\n\n\"Anon, listen, I like ya. You're not a complete dumbass\" Delewski replies, sounding almost sincere. \"I get that you wanna sneak off with your, admittedly pretty hot, punk rock dino girlfriend here. More power to ya. Personally, I would not be willing to put my package within six inches of those little needle teeth. It looks like a meatball sub of pain. You're braver man than I am. Now I don't know what kinda freaky carpentry themed bdsm thing you two are into, and I don't judge you for that. You do you. That said, I can't afford to lose this job. Literally. So my answer is still no.\"\n\nI sputter in embarrassment, a thousand denials and protests jumbling over each other. I should insist Fang and I aren't together, but she's right here! I mean, it's not like we are dating, but should I instantly deny the accusation? Is that a good idea, a bad idea, or neither? How can a teacher say something like that anyway??\n\n\"That means scram you two!\" Mr Delewski stands up, pushing us out the door. \"Go find some other place for your biology lesson. I have, uh... important literature to catch up on.\"\n\nThe classroom door slams in my face, lock turning from the inside. I stare at the frosted glass, mentally struggling to get a sentence together.\n\n\"What the fuck??\" I shout. Yeah, that seems like a good one given the circumstances. \"How the hell did he ever become a teacher?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me dweeb, maybe it's a quota thing.\" Fang answers. She seems somehow unperturbed by that disaster, but I notice she's pretty intently looking away from me. \"Screw him anyway, let's get out of here.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that was never going to work.\" I concede as Fang storms off. I trail behind at a distance, making sure to lock my gaze on the lockers instead of...anything else. \"So where to now? Any other ideas?\"\n\n\"Let's go meet up with Reed and Trish.\" Fang answers, heading down the stairs into the school's lower level, \"They should be waiting for us outside the shop.\"\n\n\"You uh... planning on breaking in?\" I ask. I don't know if Fang can pick locks, but I wouldn't put it past her. Lockpicking was one of those things I was mildly interested in for an afternoon, before I realized it was way more work than I thought. Fang though, I could see her really learning how.\n\n\"No dork, we'll just use these.\" Fang replies, twirling a keychain merrily around her finger. She turns back and gives me a big cheeky grin, looking triumphant.\n\n\"You stole his keys??\" I sputter, surprised, \"How the heck did you do that?\"\n\n\"I just swiped them off his desk when he wasn't looking.\" Fang smirks, tossing the keychain in the air and catching it, \"I doubt he'll even notice until tomorrow, and he'll never admit he lost them. I'll just slide them back when we're done next week.\"\n\nI spot Reed and Trish waiting outside one of the few classrooms down on this level. Most of the doors in the school's lower level lead to janitorial closets, storerooms, or the cesspool of sweat and cheap deodorant known as the gym locker rooms. The lockers are old, rusted, and unused. The only classes that take place down here are those that barely have enough students to justify existing. Nobody comes down here unless they have a good reason, or they just don't want to be seen. Back in the corner is the shop class, tucked away where the sound of power tools won't disturb anyone. Not that there was really any risk of that to begin with. Reed is lounging against the door next to Trish, who is busy angrily tapping something into her phone.\n\n\"Sup Fang?\" Reed asks, capping his thermos and tossing it in his bag, \"We all good?\"\n\n\"You know it.\" Fang grins, unlocking the door. The four of us head in, fanning out and inspecting the room. I flick on the the overhead fluorescent lights, which sputter to life and emit a low droning buzz as I look around. It looks just like the shop class from my old school. Cheap wooden tables are arranged around the center of the floor, all covered with scratches, paint splotches, and vulgar amateur carvings. The floor is crossed here and there by thick power cables, scotch taped to the linoleum. Against the walls are all the saws, drills, lathes, and other potential finger removal devices I would expect to find in a school shop class. The large cabinet in the corner must be full of hand tools, Fang and Trish are already rummaging through it and assembling a pile. Reed has his head buried in one of the low cabinets, tail swishing across the floor like a giant fluffy broom as he rummages around.\n\n\"Hey, I found it!\" Reed shouts from inside the cabinet. He pulls himself out, holding an abused soldering iron and a thick roll of silver wire. He drops the bundle on one of the tables, along with the various tools Fang and Trish gathered.\n\n\"Right, so. Um...\" Fang looks around uncertainly, the scale of the task starting to sink in, \"I guess we better get started.\"\n\n\"We still need parts, and a working wiring diagram.\" Reed points out, slipping back into his technical expertise. \"I can look around my usual place for spare parts while you draft up a plan.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we can do that!\" Trish chimes in, suspiciously enthusiastic, \"Anon can come with and help out while Fang and I work here.\"\n\n\"Sure, no problem.\" I agree, gritting my teeth. Trish you duplicitous bitch, is there anything you won't do to get rid of me? I'll take the hit this time, since hanging out with Reed actually sounds alright, and this is supposed to be Fang's project. I can't just babysit her the entire time.\n\n\"Sweet, let's go Anon!\" Reed slaps my shoulder, heading back out into the hallway. I follow after him, stopping reluctantly for just a moment. I look back at Fang, who smiles and waves me off with a vague 'shoo' motion. She'll be fine, Fang can look after herself. I should really have more faith in her. \n\nI follow Reed outside and across the parking lot, toward what I can only assume is his car. If I had been forced to describe Reed's car before today, I would have been pretty much spot on.  I can't tell where the rust ends and the faded red pain begins. No two tires match, the trunk is held closed by bungee cords, and the bumper looks like it's one speed-bump away from completely falling off. This thing was probably a junker when my dad was in high-school.\n\nReed opens the door and jumps in, leaning over to the passenger seat and tossing a pile of empty cans behind him. I wrench the passenger door open, the rusted metal screeching in protest, and settle into the musty seat. At least the upholstery is mostly intact, more or less. Reed turns the key and the engine sputters to life, spewing acrid black smoke out the tailpipe. Before I can ask what happened to the missing seatbelt, Reed slams the gear into reverse and peels out, careening around the parking lot and flying onto the road.\n\n\"So, Reed. Where are we going?\" I ask, pushing myself off the door and climbing back into my seat. I hope this rolling scrapyard doesn't get us pulled over. Judging by the amount of glass audibly clinking together in the trunk, the police wouldn't just us off with a stern warning.\n\n\"Just a little pawn shop down by the waterfront.\" Reed answers, popping an honest to god cassette tape into the radio. After fiddling with a few knobs, the familiar sound of Fang's band begins crackling through the abused speakers. At least it's one of their newer songs, or so I think anyway, it's hard to tell through all the popping and static. Bouncing over a pothole, a particularly loud creak of metal draws my attention down to my feet. I notice a small draft on my ankles, and as I look closer I glimpse speeding asphalt through a peephole in the floor.\n\n\"Jesus man, do you have a raccoon living in here?\" I ask, warily checking seats behind me. Who knows what's buried under all those soda cans, cannibalized speakers, and fast food bags.\n\n\"No man, of course not.\" Reed laughs, swerving around a corner and bouncing over the curb. \"Not since the possum moved in at least.\"\n\nThirty harrowing minutes later Reed careens into an old, abused asphalt lot down in the waterfront district. I haven't been through this part of town before, but it reminds me a little too much of Skin Row. Too many boarded up windows, too much graffiti, and too many people warily looking over their shoulders. Most of the buildings are squat, utilitarian concrete structures, probably former warehouses and factories from back when the port was more active. Reed picks a random patch of asphalt to park on and kills the sputtering engine, climbing out and stretching his arms overhead. I try the broken handle on my own door a couple times, before resorting to just kicking the damn thing open. I doubt Reed minds the abuse, he doesn't say anything about it at least.\n\n\"You said you've been here before, right?\" I ask, trying not to look like a lost tourist. Normally I would be worried about leaving a car out here, but who in their right mind would steal this piece of junk?\n\n\"Oh yeah, this is where I get all the stuff for our shows.\" Reed replies, leading the way toward one of the nearby buildings. I follow after him, determined to not get left alone out here. It doesn't look like a store or anything to me. There aren't any signs or windows, just some old weather-worn posters stuck to the walls. This honestly looks like the back door to me. Unperturbed, Reed strides up to the thick metal door and pulls it open, holding ajar for me to follow him inside. A pair of faint electronic pings signal whoever must own this place that we walked, and a feminine voice calls back from further inside the building, \"Hey! Who just came in through there?\"\n\n\"It's me!\" Reed shouts back, \"Just need to pick up some stuff, be out in a sec!\" Reed must really come here often if the owner recognizes his voice. Surely that means I can afford to relax, if only a little bit. I follow Reed deeper into the building, squeezing past crowded metal shelves stacked with old cardboard boxes containing who knows what. The yellow tinted fluorescent lights overhead add to the stuffy atmosphere, the air thick with the swirling scents of mold, oil, and cigarette smoke. This place looks like the backroom of a warehouse, or some hoarder's basement. l I don't know how anyone is supposed to find anything in here, but Reed seems to know where he's going.\n\n\"What are we looking for exactly?\" I ask, peering into one of the nearby boxes. Just looks like a pile of mismatched scrap metal to me, I have no idea what any of it's for.\n\n\"Like I said, guitar electronics.\" Reed answers, rummaging through several boxes on a low shelf. \"Pickups, potentiometers, capacitors, not to mention spare wiring. Plus jacks, knobs,-\"\n\n\"Right, yeah.\" I interrupt, squatting down and trying to look over his shoulder, \"I don't know what any of that looks like, how am I supposed to help?\"\n\n\"Check that shelf.\" Reed points across the room, past a pile of faded magazines stacked against the wall. \"There should be some junked instruments over there, I'll see what we can rip out.\"\n\n\nThe next couple hours pass by quickly as Reed and I fall into a rhythm. I rummage through the boxes Reed mentioned, pulling out scraps of old busted guitars and other electronic instruments. Once I have a decent pile, I haul them over to Reed for inspection. Most of them he dismisses as useless, but several are in decent enough shape for salvage. Once we've got enough to work on, Reed shows me how to get the cases open and dismantle the interior electronics. We have to go rummaging for tools we could use, but luckily Reed knows where to find those as well. Once he shows me how to do the first couple, I start working on several myself. Slowly I learn how to differentiate the more generic pieces we're looking for, and Reed moves on to look for more particular things. I'm starting to get more of an appreciation for everything Reed does for Fang's band. How many hours has he spent rummaging around back here, disassembling and reconstructing all the equipment they use for a show? Do Trish and Fang even know how much effort he's putting into this? It's clear he's entirely self taught, which is damn impressive.\n\nEventually we have an entire milk crate filled with scrap electronics and mismatched guitar parts. I stand up, cracking my sore back, and grab our box of salvage. Following Reed through the labyrinth of shelves, we head to what I assume is the front of the shop. Things up here actually look a little more presentable, at least by comparison. There's room to walk, and some of the \"finer\" products for sale are actually on display. This place is definitely some kind of pawn shop, or maybe an antique store. I actually spot some old retro SNES games locked up in a glass case, but I know we don't have the time to just browse. Maybe I can come back another time with Reed.\n\nI drop the milk crate on the counter and get my first look at the cashier. If I didn't know better, I would have sworn that is Reed. If Reed was a girl anyway. She has the same pink scales, fluffy mane, and laid back sense of style. She leans over the glass countertop, obscuring the display of mall-ninja cutlery, and gives me a friendly smile.\n\n\"Hey, you must be Anon right? Name's Reeda.\" She introduces herself, her tied off tank-top not leaving much to the imagination. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that she's Reed's sister, which explains how she's so familiar with him. The resemblance is uncanny, except for the longer mane and the stunningly feminine figure. Those half-lidded eyes are starting to make me a little nervous, but she seems friendly enough. Perhaps too friendly, she's even twirling her hair around her finger.\n\n\"Hey sis.\" Reed interjects, literally stepping between me and the counter. He slides the milk crate over, slapping the rim. \"Just some junk parts from out back. What do you think, twenty bucks?\"\n\n\"That's big sis to you.\" Reeda smirks, looking over the crate and rummaging through the pile. She takes a closer look at some of the larger parts, tossing them back into the crate. \"Yeah, twenty sounds about right. Let me guess, tell Dad to take it out of this week's pay?\"\n\n \"Five minutes doesn't make you my 'big sis' Reeda.\" Reed retorts, pulling out his wallet. He flips through some tattered bills, counting them over a couple times, before putting the wallet back in his pocket with a sigh. \"Yeah, tell Dad to just take off my next check.\"\n\n\"No problem.\" Reeda rolls her eyes, punching something into the old register and slamming the drawer back shut. Reed grabs the crate and heads off immediately, and after an awkward pause I follow him back into the storage room.\n\n\"See you at home Reed!\" Reeda calls after him as Reed shoulders the back door open. We step out into the cool evening air, the sun already dipping far lower than I expected. Reed wrenches the back car door open and pushes the crate inside, shoving old soda cans and an amplifier out of the way. I pry my own door open and climb inside as Reed drops into the driver's seat. Reed fishes out his keys and sticks them in the ignition but stops, one hand still on the steering wheel. \n\nHe turns to look at me, his expression cold and serious. That far-off disinterested look in his eyes is gone, replaced by an interrogating intensity. I swallow down a lump in my throat, staring back at him. Somehow, I can't bring myself to look away, no matter how much I want to.\n\n\"So, Anon.\" Reed begins, staring into my very soul, \"What do you think of my sister?\"\n\nMy mouth feels like it's made of leather, and I nervously swallow again. I can tell giving Reed the wrong answer here will bring terrible consequences. Is he the overprotective brother type? Is that why I never heard anything about Reeda before? Should I answer honestly, tell him I'm not interested? I had only recently come to terms with my feelings for Fang, and that took some work. I'm not going to jump at his sister after just one meeting. I can't just blow her off though, she's still family. I'm going to have to walk a fine line here.\n\n\"She seems...friendly?\" I reply, instantly regretting my choice of words. Oh god, that can be construed in all the wrong ways. I can see Reed's eyes narrow, the leather steering wheel creaking under his grip. Backpedal Anon, backpedal!\n\n\"I just mean, she looks laid back. Chill.\" I hastily continue, instinctively leaning toward the door, \"I definitely see the family resemblance. Twins, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, twins.\" Reed finally turns the ignition, reversing out of the parking spot and skidding across the asphalt lot. He stops an the curb, turning to face me one more time. \"So, are you going to ask if she's single?\"\n\n\"No..?\" I awkwardly answer, \"Why would I?\"\n\nReed shrugs, bouncing over the sidewalk and peeling out into the street. I push myself off the door again and settle back into my seat, bracing my feet against floor. Reed turns on the abused stereo while I crank down the window, letting the salty seaside air blow through the cab as we head back up into the bluffs.\n\n\nThe sun has nearly set by the time we swerve back into the Volcano High parking lot. We had made a slight detour to grab some greasy fast food along the way, the soggy paper sacks bunched up between my feet. Reed grabs the milk crate while I gather up the food, sneaking a couple fries from Trish's bag. Luckily the basement door is still unlocked, possibly for whatever sports teams are still practicing this late. The building has a strangely eerie feel to it with all the lights off, your footsteps echoing down the deserted hallway. At least there's still some light spilling out from behind the shop classroom door.\n\nAs Reed and I push the door open and head in, I spot Trish and Fang at the table right where we had left them. Trish and Fang are watching something intently on Trish's phone, laughing and talking animatedly. I can hear rock music coming from the speakers as Fang looks up, quickly turning off the phone. Her eyes dart to the darkening sky out the widow and back to me, her smile turning forced and guilty.\n\n\"Hey guys. Get anything good?\" She asks, eyeing the box of scrap parts Reed drops on the table. I cross my arms, pointedly looking at the backpack lying right where Fang had tossed it hours ago. I don't see any notes, textbooks, or even a pencil. Fang at least has the decency to look sheepish, Trish just seems indignant and put-off.\n\n\"Yeah, so uh...\" Fang trails off, scratching the back of her head, \"Trish and I decided to take a quick break after you left, and I guess we accidentally got a little distracted...\"\n\nYeah right, I'd bet my last dollar Trish knew exactly what she was doing. I roll my eyes, tossing Fang and Trish each a bag of cheap fast food. I hand the last bag to Reed, who also seems content to glare in silent judgement at the two girls. Even he must know the indignity of working for hours just to find your 'partners' goofing off.\n\n\"Oh just relax you two.\" Trish scoffs, biting into her veggie burger, \"Fang's still got plenty of time. Besides, we were doing important band research.\"\n\n\"Alright, if you say so Trish.\" Reed sighs, grabbing his thermos and popping off the lid. \"It's no biggie.\" I try to mask my disappointment the best I can as he takes a deep swig. I can't believe Reed just rolled over that easily! Surely he knows how important this project is to Fang, the whole band is at stake after all. How am I more invested in this than he is?\n\n\"Hey Anon, look. I'm sorry, okay?\" Fang apologizes, clearing noticing how I really feel, \"I know you don't have to help me with this. I'll stay focused from now on, alright?\"\n\n\"You better.\" I retort, fishing out my own burger and taking a seat, \"If you don't, I'll stop letting you crib off my science homework every morning.\"\n\n\"You hardass.\" Fang smiles, leaning over to steal some of my fries. I slap her hand away, turning to ignore her theatrical pouting.\n\n\"How about this?\" Fang continues between bites, \"While Reed shows me how to use that soldering iron, could you and Trish pick up some books from the library for me?\"\n\n\"Oh c'mon, why can't he get them himself?\" Trish instantly complains, glaring at me as if this was somehow my idea. \"I can still help out here.\"\n\n\"You're just going to be looking over my shoulder the whole time.\" Fang insists, \"I think you'll survive ten minutes alone with Anon.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but he won't...\" Trish angrily grumbles, taking another bite of her burger. I know she meant for me to hear that. I'm not looking forward to this either, but now I can't back out or I'm the coward. Part of me wonders if Fang is intentionally getting Trish out of here, knowing she's going to be a distraction.\n\n\"Alright fine,\" Trish concedes, balling up her wrapper and tossing it into the trash, \"Lets get this over with monkey boy.\"\n\n\"After you, horn-head.\" I reply, standing up. Trish mumbles something vaguely threatening and stomps off and I leisurely follow after her, leaving Reed to whatever technical lessons he plans on giving. Trish and I head upstairs to the main level. The library is adjoined to the central hub of the school, right in the center of the building. The lights are all off inside, and unsurprisingly the door refuses to budge when I pull it.\n\n\"It's locked, dumbass.\" Trish states the obvious, shouldering me out of the way. She pulls out her school I.D., sliding between the doors. After a bit of fidgeting and a satisfying click she pulls the doors open, looking smug.\n\n\"I could have done that...\" I mutter, edging past her and walking inside. The hallways seemed creepy earlier, but the deserted library is way worse. Between the ominous dark aisles and eerie silence, this is the perfect setting for a cheesy slasher fic.\n\n\"So, what are we looking for exactly?\" Trish asks as we both pull out our phones, using the screens as makeshift flashlights. She already sounds bored with this, and probably would have gone back already if I wasn't here.\n\n\"I don't know, something to help with the essay.\" I answer, scanning the label on the nearest aisle, \"Maybe a textbook on electronics, or soundwaves, anything really.\"\n\nThe two of us work our way up and down the shelves of books, reading the spines by the light of our phones. The room seems so much larger in the dark, the carpeted floor muffling any echoes or noise. The silence is oppressive, made all the worse by the simmering animosity between Trish and I. Normally I would have just asked the librarian where to look, but obviously that isn't an option. Although, that thought does bring up an important detail.\n\n\"Crap, how are we supposed to check these out?\" I ask, pulling an old electronics textbook off the shelf. I honestly don't know if it will be much help, but I feel like I need to start with something.\n\n\"Just take them, who cares?\" Trish shrugs, looking over a cover and shoving it back into place, \"We'll bring them back eventually anyway.\" At first I want to object, but once I think about it she's probably right. It's not like anyone will know we were in here, and we're going to return the books eventually anyway. At worst, we'd just cause the librarian some confusion. It's not like many students even use this place anyway.\n\nSlowly, the stack of books in my arms grows taller as the minutes pass by. I'm honestly not sure if even half of these will really be helpful, but I feel like I need to at least grab something. Trish doesn't seem to share that sentiment. She's yet to pick out anything, rejecting book after book with visibly growing frustration.\n\n\"This is such a waste of time.\" Trish grumbles, slamming another book back onto the shelf, her tail swinging angrily behind her. \n\n\"Why not go check the music section?\" I reply, firmly aware she meant more than just this book search.\n\n\"You know what I mean, skinnie.\" Trish snaps back, not even bothering to lace the insult with a fa\u00e7ade of friendliness. \"Fang doesn't need this stupid project, she needs to keep practicing. Why are you even here?\"\n\n\"Fang asked me for help.\" I answer as frustratingly literal as possible. I'm not sure where Trish's deep seated animosity comes from, but it's definitely easy to piss her off. I can practically hear her teeth grating from here.\n\n\"She doesn't need your help.\" Trish retorts, turning to glare at me. Even with the faint light, I can see her fists balled at her sides as she stares me down.\n\n\"Does she need yours?\" I ask, the words popping out of my mouth before I can think. I don't know where that came from, but it seems to have worked. Trish rocks back, stunned out of her anger. Several emotions flash across her face; shock, outrage, shame, then finally indignation. Her mouth gapes like a fish as she tries and fails to formulate a response, finally storming off without a word.\n\nI let her go, turning back to searching the shelves. I won't give her the satisfaction of chasing after her, and it gives me time to bask in my triumph. It's rare that I render Trish completely speechless after our verbal spats, and I want to savor the moment. Truthfully, I intended to call it quits and head back soon anyway, but I'll let Trish stew for a couple minutes longer.\n\nOnce I figure she's had enough time to simmer down, I head off to look for Trish. It's not hard to spot the glow of her phone in the dark, all the way over at the far end of the library. She stands up as I walk towards her, a couple thin books held in her arms. Without a word she shoves them onto my pile, shouldering past me and heading back into the hallway. Grabbing the top book, I can just barely read cover; 'The Science of Electrical Instruments'. Huh, how about that.\n\nAfter Trish and I drop off the books we collected with Fang, the whole group spent the next several hours helping Fang out with her project. Reed continues teaching Fang the finer point of soldering iron etiquette, Fang only managing to singe her feathers once. Trish and I pour through the textbooks, earmarking chapters that look at least hallways relevant to the project. As I suspected, most of what I had picked out is nearly useless, but the couple Trish found turn out to be perfect sources. We don't go so far as to read through everything entirely or start taking notes, this is supposed to be Fang's project after all.\n\nEventually I'm forced to call it quits. Walking home through Skin Row is dangerous enough as it is, but if it gets any later it will be just plain stupid. Everyone else takes the opportunity to head home themselves, gathering up their things and waving goodbye. I grab the books we didn't end up using, deciding I might as well return them tonight.\n\nAfter I nearly fill the book return slot, I head back through to pitch black halls to the front door. There was barely enough light to see earlier, but now I'm forced to use my phone as a flashlight again. This place really is perfect for some kind of shitty Doom wad, or a low budget horror flick. There's got to be some kind of school film club, they've probably already made one. As I pass the cafeteria however, something catches my eye. It looks like there a light on inside, and I can just barely hear some kind of strange noise.\n\nI should just go home before it gets any later, but I can't help but be curious. Who the heck would be in the cafeteria this late at night? I step inside, noticing the light is actually coming from behind the kitchen door. I should just pretend I didn't see anything, put this out of my mind, but I'm compelled to look. This is how the first guy dies in every horror movie, I know that. I'll just take a quick peek and get out of here.\n\nI gently push the door open, craning my neck to look around the corner. The light is coming from a large battered microwave, a cup of instant noodles slowly turning inside. Standing in front of it is none other than Mr Delewski, wearing nothing but some boxers and a tattered tank-top. He's air-drumming, waving his arms and bobbing his head as he loudly hums some horrendously mangled beat. Oh sweet Raptor Jesus, that fat bastard really does live here. I should turn around and get out of here before he notices, but I can't look away. I'm captured by morbid curiosity, like a driver passing a horrible car wreck on the highway.\n\nMr. Delewski stops, some instinctive part of his brain warning him that's he's being watched. With mounting horror I watch as he slowly turns, looking me straight in the eye. We stare at each other without a word, the room silent except for the gentle hum of the microwave. An unspoken understanding passes between us, the way it only can between two men who precisely understand each other. Nobody moves as the microwave beeps, the timer finally finished counting down.\n\n\"You, uh...\" Delewski begins, breaking the silence, \"You won't tell noone about this, will ya?\"\n\n\"Bump my grade up to a 'C', and we're good.\" I reply, impulsively deciding to take my chance.\n\n\"You're a good man Anon.\" Mr Delewski nods as I slowly back out of the doorway, \"You's a good man.\"\n\n\n\nFang works tirelessly as the week drags on, staying up well into the night. She nods off constantly, jolting awake every time I nudge her desk when a teacher looks her way. During lunch she either has her face buried in a book, or is talking Reed's ears off with questions. Trish continues to stew in her frustration, but at least she doesn't try to badger Fang about the project anymore. Not that she can do much about it anyway, Ripley was true to his word. Fang is banned from band practice unless she gets a passing grade, her guitar locked up tight and out of her reach.\n\nI want to help out, to ease the burden off her shoulders, but I hold myself back. Besides the fact that this is supposed to be an individual project, it's refreshing to see her so invested in something. Somewhere along the line, this endeavor switched from being an obligation to becoming a passion. Fang's eyes are alive as they pour over wiring schematics and soldering instructions. I can see her lost in thought during class, quietly mumbling to herself as she twirls a pencil around her fingers. She's doing this now because she wants to see if she can, to see what she's capable of. I can't compromise that.\n\nAfter a nice long weekend of sleeping in, trolling forums, and playing xrox, it's time for school again. Yawning as I walk up the front steps, I meet Fang and the gang at the school doors. Fang has her familar guitar case with her again, but I know it must contain her pet project. It's pretty adorable how protective she is of it, holding it tight as she warily looks out for anything that could threaten it.\n\n\"Hey Fang, you got it done?\" I point to the guitar case, asking more as a formality than anything else.\n\n\"Yeah, I think so.\" Fang drums her fingers across the case, looking apprehensive. \"It was working okay last night when I checked it. It should still be fine, as long as nothing bumped lose on the ride over here. I could pop the case open and check before class-\"\n\n\"Fang, you gotta chill.\" Reed drapes an arm over Fang's shoulder, leaning into her and nearly pushing her over. Fang rolls her eyes and squirms free, shoving Reed away as he grins. \"It'll be fine. I checked over everything with you yesterday, remember? You're good to go girl.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know.\" Fang sighs, soothing her nerves. The group splits up as we head to our lockers, Fang and I heading down the same hallway. I can see her wings still are uncomfortably tensed. She must really be nervous about this. It's not hard to guess why, she really poured her all into this project. If Dr. Fernsworth tears it apart right in front of her, that would be devastating.\n\n\"Hey, Anon?\" Fang tugs on my sleeve as I head off to class. She tries to look aloof, but I can tell she's apprehensive about something. \"You mind coming with me to the presentation? I need somebody to help carry Reed's amp.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure.\" I agree, seeing right through her act. She could have easily asked Reed earlier if she only needed a tech jockey. We fistbump and part ways, heading off to our first classes for the day.\n\n\n\nThe time to submit the projects is during lunch break, so rather than go to the cafeteria I head outside to the parking lot. Reed tossed me his keys earlier in the day so I could grab an old amplifier out of the trunk for the presentation. After prying the mangled hood open and making sure the possum isn't inside, I grab the handheld amp and head back to Fernsworth's classroom. The amp looks like something straight out of the 80s, sided with fake wood paneling and a crosshatch speaker cover. It's probably another one of Reed's restoration projects.\n\nStepping into Fernsworth's classroom, it looks like about five other students besides Fang took up Fernsworth's offer for extra credit. Everyone looks nervous, suddenly anxious their work won't be up to his stringent standards. One student appears to have built some kind of electrical device, probably a radio if I had to guess. Another built some kind of model airplane, it doesn't look like it came from a kit at least. A very bored looking stegosaur is seriously submitting a model solar system that belongs better at a first grade science fair. That poor soul.\n\nFang is leaning against the back wall with her guitar case, waving me over. Dropping the amp next to Fang's feet, I take up position beside her against the wall. Fang gives me a small \"Sup?\" in greeting, crossing her arms over her stomach. I match her posture, mimicking all her little mannerisms and actions as we wait, trying not to smirk. Fang catches on eventually, elbowing me in the side as she snickers.\n\n\"Alright, settle down everyone.\" Dr. Fernsworth unnecessarily announces as he walks in, it's not like anyone is really talking. He shuffles over to his desk, adjusting his comically thick glasses as he takes a seat. \"Now then, who would like to go first?\" Nobody volunteers, everyone warily eyeing the room hoping someone else will go first. \n\n\"Well let's just go in alphabetical order then.\" Fernsworth looks over the group, stopping on Fang and I in the back. \"Fang, why don't you go first then?\"\n\n\"Fine.\" Fang stand up, grabbing her guitar case. She marches confidently to Fernsworth's desk and unlatches the case, pulling out her homemade guitar. I follow her up, standing to the side of the room where I can still get a good view. It's the first time I've ever seen Fang's guitar, and I wasn't sure what to expect. The whole assembly has a improvised and macgyvered look to it. I recognize the different parts Reed and I scrounged up in the pawn shop, now all assembled into a complete guitar with strangely mismatched colors and materials. It looks sturdy enough, but I can see where Fang made mistakes putting it together; a little too much glue here, a small spiderweb of cracks there.\n\n\"Okay, so... for my project I constructed an electric guitar from spare parts.\" Fang begins, pulling out the essay from her backpack and sliding it over. \"In my paper, I go over how each of the individual components works and how they all come together to make the guitar, um... work.\"\n\nFang flips over the guitar, spinning a few loose screws and removing the back cover to reveal the interior. It's a mess of wires and electrical bits I barely recognize, the whole thing just a tangled rat's nest to me. Fernsworth flips through Fang's essay, glancing between the paper and the guitar as he skims the pages. Fang goes on to explain the internal wiring, the jargon and terminology flying entirely over my head. Fernsworth only hmms and hums as Fang continues, stumbling over her words occasionally. She's normally so confident performing in front of a crowd, but here she's out of her element. As Fang trails off, running out of things to say, Fernsworth finally starts asking questions. Once again, I'm stumped as to what he's talking about, but I can tell he knows what to ask. He probably already has the answers, but he's really testing Fang to see if she did the research herself. Fang is holding her own so far, but I can tell her nerves are fraying.\n\n\"Alright then Fang, just two more questions.\" Fernsworth adjusts his glasses, \"First, did Anon help you with this project?\" Fang hesitates, internally weighing her options. If she admits that not just I, but Trish and Reed all helped out on this project Fernsworth might just reject it outright. On the other hand, she can't just deny it entirely. Tagging along with Fang today may have been a mistake, I've already essentially admitted my involvement. Anything I could say would only undermine her, so I'm forced to keep my mouth shut and wait for Fang's answer.\n\n\"Yeah, Anon helped out a bit.\" Fang confesses, her tone growing defensive, \"Just at the start though, I did all of this myself.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I'm sure\" Fernsworth holds his hands up, trying to mollify Fang before she gets going. \" I suppose I never said you couldn't have any help. Second question then, does it work?\"\n\nFang snatches the audio cable from the amp, slotting it into the guitar as she slings the strap over her shoulders. The amp pops and crackles as I plug it into the wall, a low electric hum filling the classroom. The other students are paying more attention now, some of them whispering warnings to each other and scooting away from the speaker. Fang doesn't notice, or at least she doesn't care. Fang was nervous before with an academic prsentation, but now she's back on her home turf.\n\nHer fingers sweep over the strings, a clear melodic chord singing across the room. The student's whispers are silenced as the notes echo for a few moments, but Fang isn't satisfied yet. Her fingers dance up and down the neck of her guitar as she improvises a melody, simple yet full of emotion. Everything Fang put into this project comes flowing out in her song. Her doubts, her determination, her hopes, I can hear them all. It's not the most elegant melody, but it's hard to disparage her enthusiasm. Fang's song slowly comes to a natural end, her expression relaxed and sincere. She bolts upright as the amp crackles as if she was lost in a trance, unslinging the guitar and returning it to the case.\n\n\"Well Fang, that was very impressive!\" Fernsworth claps, his wrinkled face splitting into an uncharacteristic grin.\n\n\"Good enough for an 'A'?\" Fang asks hopefully, leaning forward and hanging onto his next words.\n\n\"Oh my, no...\" Fernsworth waves dismissively, Fang's face falling in an instant. My heart drops as I stammer out an incoherent protest. Fang has worked so hard for this, and it turned out perfectly! That isn't fair!\n\n\"Although, I don't think a 'B' wouldn't be out of the question.\" Fernsworth continues with a sly smirk, \"Extra credit can only go so far after all.\" Oh, that cocky little bastard. I want to step forward and throttle his gross baggy neck, but Fang pulls me away by the arm before I can act on it. I just barely hear Fernsworth call for the next presentation before Fang drags me out the door, clearly eager to get out of there. Once we're out in the empty hallway Fang throws her arms around my neck with a squeal of delight, her weight nearly sending both of us stumbling down onto the floor. I reflexively wrap my arms around her back for balance, my face burning up as I realize what's happening. We stumble around in an awkward dance as we both try to catch our balance, Fang flapping her wings and laughing all the while. Mercifully she lets me go before I completely embarrass myself, her mood far too good to notice anything amiss.\n\n\"Yes! I did it! I got a 'B'!\" Fang beams, pumping her fists in the air while bouncing from foot to foot. My heart swells seeing her this happy, her smile totally infectious. That late night spent working in the basement was definitely worth it, just to see her this happy.\n\n\"Congratulation champ, I knew you had it in you.\" I tease, laying it on thick. Fang playfully punches me in the shoulder, still giddy with excitement. I point to the guitar case Fang still has slung over her back, \"So, what are you going to do with that?\"\n\nFang swings the case around and opens it, running her fingers over the chipped wood surface inside. Her excitable mood is gone quickly as she falls deep into thought. I don't think she has actually considered what do with it after today, she was probably too wrapped up in making it first. It performed well enough back in the classroom, but even I can tell it's far from the quality of her own guitar, which already has a spare. Fang gently plucks the inert metallic strings, lost in thought.\n\n\"Do you want it?\" She suddenly asks, looking seriously at me. This isn't what I was expecting, the question stuns me. I don't know what to say, she clearly isn't kidding. Fang removes the guitar from it's case, placing it in my upturned hands. I feel the unfamiliar weight in my palms, unsure if I can really accept.\n\n\"I've already got two guitars at home, I don't need a third.\" Fang explains, noticing my reluctance. She lifts the strap up and over my neck, standing back to admire how it looks on me. \"Besides, this way you can practice at home. You're up for more lessons, right dork?\"\n\nMy fingers run up the neck of the guitar, tracing all the little flaws and imperfections. I look over all the mismatched parts, the clashing colors, and the worn-out roughened exterior. It's a perfect fit for me, I'm forced to admit. Fang poured her soul into making this, and now she wants me to have it. I can already tell this is going to be one of my most treasured possessions.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I smile, matching her grin and slinging the guitar over my shoulder, \"That sounds good to me.\"","Title":"Science Project","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed, Reeda, Carldelewski, Fernsworth and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Snoot Game - Meteor Drop.txt":{"path":["Fang","Snoot Game - Meteor Drop.txt"],"text":"Title: Snoot Game - Meteor Drop\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Kris, Susie and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: SticksNTricks\nSummary: Fang and Anon go for some Burgers\n\n\nThere was a popular burger stop not too far from Skin Row. It was managed by some weird dude in a winter outfit. It was the summer of 200M2021, and this was about the weirdest sight to behold. But the burgers were good, and that\u2019s what mattered. Before the summer started, Anon bumped into this place by chance. Now it was one of his favorite spots. Mostly because the prices were dirt fucking cheap for a good burger.\n\nBut this was more or less a treat. He couldn\u2019t afford to be a regular patron of this place as much as he really, really wanted to. But he wanted to bring Fang here for a good time. The school cafeteria didn\u2019t have bad food, but it certainly had nothing compared to this place.\n\n\u201cWhat is it called again?\u201d Fang asked Anon as they took the corner to the next street.\n\nThe smell was so distracting for Anon that he swore he could taste it now. It only took him a moment to come to his senses after Fang spoke. \u201cHuh, wha? Oh. Uhh\u2026 the place is called Meteor Drop.\u201d\n\nFang tried her hardest to suppress her laughter. \u201cSubtle. Why do they even call it that?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably because their signature burger is the \u2018Meteor Drop.\u2019 Massive fucking burger like you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Anon explained.\n\nWhen was the last time (before Meteor Drop) did he last have a burger of those massive portions? There was Burger Rex\u2019s \u2018The Dinopper\u2019 but they weren\u2019t exactly big patties and Burger Rex was a fast food franchise.\n\n\u201cShit its been a while since I last had a burger. Since we got this whole band started, I mostly kept watch of what I eat,\u201d Fang said with a shrug. \u201cTrish said it was healthier this way. Eating meat and grease causes health problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean\u2026 I agree about the grease but eating meat is kinda pushing the \u2018health risk\u2019 argument a bit. Wait\u2026\u201d Anon cocked his eyebrow. \u201cWait, aren't you a carnivore? Don\u2019t you need to eat meat and all that jazz?\u201d\n\nFang shifted her gaze aside for a moment. \u201cIt's complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike about everything else Trish recommends you do that seems out of whack a bit?\u201d Anon gently nudges her with his elbow. \u201cCome on. It\u2019s summer break. And if you\u2019re worried about putting on a couple pounds then you can work it off. That\u2019s what I always do.\u201d\n\nFang squinted at Anon. No doubt Anon could hear the bullshit alarms going off in her head. \u201cAnon I don\u2019t think you work anything off other than your thumbs.\u201d\n\nAnon playfully winced at her remark. \u201cOuch! Fair but, ouch! Way to kick a guy when he\u2019s down.\u201d\n\nThe pterodactyl snickered and shook her head. \u201cC\u2019mon man. Anyways, it's not like I don\u2019t treat myself to meat once in a while. Just not whenever Trish is looking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose she says anything about your dino nuggets?\u201d he asked as he stopped to open the door for Fang. This time without getting his foot smashed.\n\n\u201cOh, I just told her they were tofu nuggies,\u201d she said as she stepped in.\n\nA fresh breeze of cold air struck the two as they strode inside. A sigh of content escaped from both of them after having been out in the heat. Not that they had complained much about it until now.\n\n\u201cWell, now we\u2019ll enjoy ourselves in the company of greasy cooked beef burgers without having the tyrant three horned midget chasing after us,\u201d Anon added.\n\nFang frowned a bit at his comment. \u201cMaybe lay off a bit on her with the insults, okay? She\u2019s still my friend too.\u201d\n\nHer reaction was about what he expected. Anon grimaced a bit but shrugged. She had a point there. It wasn\u2019t like he had to make Fang choose between him and Trish. And besides, this was their time to enjoy together.\n\n\u201cAh, fine. I\u2019ll lay off. But only because you said so.\u201d\n\nFang reached up with one hand and patted his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s a good boy. Now, how bout we get that slab of grease slapped into our bellies eh?\u201d\n\nAnon felt his cheeks burn a tint of red from that. Physical contact with a woman once more. Though now there weren't any alarms going off in his head again. Quickly he shook it off and got in line behind a large purple scaled looking dinosaur. At least, he was sure it was one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fucking starving man. How long is this going to take?\u201d said the purple dino in an annoyed voice.\n\n\u201cEasy Sus, the wait\u2019ll be worth it. I mean, you see the prices are definitely worth it eh? Besides, we got air conditioning in here,\u201d said another voice from beside her.\n\nOh wait, there was another human here wasn\u2019t there? Well, okay that makes sense since they weren\u2019t too far from Skin Row. Were they together or something?\n\n\u201cIt better be Kris. If it is as good as it smells, let's make this our hangout.\u201d\n\nFang and Anon looked at one another and back over at the couple. There was something familiar about this situation.\n\n\u201cHey Fang, you ever get something that\u2019s quite like deja vu but not deja vu?\u201d Anon asked.\n\n\u201cI mean\u2026 sometimes?\u201d She didn\u2019t have much to say after that. Though the look in her eyes said exactly the same thing Anon was thinking.\n\nThey kinda remind us of\u2026 well us.\n\nThe line thinned at the passing of each minute. The purple saurian seemed to get more and more anxious as the line drew to a close. Eventually it was their turn. An obnoxious voice came from behind the counter. Another human wearing an obscenely heavy winte coat and had.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Meteor Drop! Home of the Meteor Drop! May I take your order?\u201d he called out.\n\nHis voice was higher pitched than Anon thought was possible. If he didn\u2019t know any better, he'd swore it was a 40 year old woman\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHoly shit his voice is like fingernails against a chalkboard,\u201d Fang hissed through gritted teeth.\n\nAnon was not a big fan either. Though really, who was he to judge? He himself wasn\u2019t exactly the spitting image of masculinity. (Of course he was also an unreliable narrator and everyone was their own worst critic.) And it wasn\u2019t like the weird winter coated dude looked anything other than a guy from his build.\n\n\u201cTwo Meteor Drops. Pronto!\u201d the punk gal spoke.\n\n\u201cYes big scary purple ma\u2019am! Would you like the Winter Sauce to go along with it?\u201d\n\nA few disturbing images went through Anon\u2019s gutter brain when he heard that. This was the first time he heard of this \u2018Winter Sauce.\u2019\n\nShutthefuckupbraindontthinkaboutit\n\n\u201cYeah sure why not? I\u2019m just hungry man. Gimme the biggest fattest burger you got,\u201dshe muttered.\n\nFang was just tapping away the seconds. She was also wondering if this wait was worth the burger. At least they work fast here, that\u2019s about all she had to say given it took like what? Five minutes to grill those bad boys?\n\nAfter that, the couple received their meals and went to grab their seats. Last was Anon and Fang\u2019s turn in line. The great big goofy smile of the old wom- I mean young man never seemed to leave his face.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Meteor Drop! Home of the Meteor Drop! May I take your order?\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nAnon turned to Fang and whispered to her; \u201cHe\u2019ll do that every time no matter if he already knows you or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh great, thanks for warning me,\u201d she grunted in her reply. Then turned to face the winter coated freak. \u201cI\u2019ll take two Meteor Drops, well done. And uhh\u2026 throw in that Winter Sauce while you\u2019re at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh of course! Anything for the happy couple!\u201d he exclaimed before diving right into the kitchen before Fang and Anon could even bark \u2018he\/she\u2019s not my boyfriend\/girlfriend!\u2019\n\nThe human went right to work cooking those patties. The rich scent of beef was thick in the air and it was rising from the greasepit where the overheated wintered human. It was amazing how he was still conscious and didn\u2019t look like an oven roasted pork being in the heated kitchen like that.\n\n\u201cSo, skinny! Why do you call your sauce the \u2018Winter Sauce?\u2019\u201d Fang called out. Anon had hoped she wouldn\u2019t have asked that.\n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s an old family recipe! A secret that each Winter passes around to their forebears!\u201d the man called out from the kitchen.\n\n\u201cOh wow. Your name\u2019s actually Winter?\u201d Fang just smirked at that.\n\nThat was about the least conspicuous name for a guy like him with how he was dressed up.\n\n\u201cOh yes! Winter the 27th! That is me! And I settled in Volcadera Bluffs to spread the good word of my special sauce!\u201d\n\nFor a moment, Winter left the grill, before returning back to pull alongside him some cement mixer looking contraption that was just covered in icicles. A great big blast of chilly white smoke came spewing out from the nozzle of the mixer and splashed all over the grill. What was left was nothing more than just a very, very wet workstation, and glistening greasy patties.\n\nA hop skip and a jump later and Winter came back out, with two sodas and two dressed up, fat, juicy looking \u2018Meteor Drops\u2019 glazed with this \u2018Winter Sauce\u2019 that looked like absolutely nothing.\n\n\u201cUhhhhhh\u2026. Where\u2019s the sauce?\u201d Fang asked, very confused.\n\n\u201cYeah. I was hoping for something more fitting for its name. Like\u2026 being white?\u201d Anon added. \u201cI mean it looks like there\u2019s nothing!\u201d\n\nWinter held up one finger and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t knock it till you try it! This is 65 Million Years in the making!\u201d\n\nFang just stared at him with this deadpan look. \u201cReally? God I already have to deal with one dweeb. Now how much does it cost?\u201d\n\nThe wannabe Russian slapped his hand across the cashier as $7.35 popped up on the bar. \u201cSeven thirty-five missy! Now would that be cash or credit?!\u201d\n\nAnon reached into his pocket to pull out his wallet. \u201cI got this.\u201d\n\nThe ptero girl cocked her brow at the human. \u201cWait, you\u2019re paying for me too?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not? I brought you here and it's the least I can do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, Anon you didn\u2019t have to do that. I would have paid for my own food,\u201d and then she grinned mischievously. \u201cOh not that I mind though. I rather liked having you pay for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t you make it a habit. This place is cheap but I don\u2019t make a habit of coming here all the time.\u201d\n\nAfter paying for the meal, the two took the nearest booth they could find. Preferably one that was directly beneath one of the AC vents, with Fang and Anon sitting across one another. It was a rather large burger now that Fang had the moment to process its size. She had this concerned look to her eyes that said; \u2018fuck would I be able to fit this in my mouth?\u2019\n\nShe looked up at Anon. \u201cYou never told me they were this big.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said they were the fattest fucking patties for a reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver had their \u2018Winter Sauce?\u201d\n\nAnon shook his head. \u201cFirst time I\u2019m trying them now actually. I almost had a very bad thought that they weren\u2019t exactly the kind of \u2018sauce\u2019 that we saw. But I\u2019m glad I was wrong.\u201d\n\nShe cocked an eyebrow at that. \u201cWhat did you thi-\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up and let's eat!\u201d Anon exclaimed before biting into his burger.\n\nAs he did, a cascade of flavors came washing over him. His taste buds were fucking exploding! There was this delectable taste of spicy and sweetness to it. Not sugar-like sweetness but something that was more or less honey flavored. The kind of shit that beats Ptero Chang\u2019s \u2018sweet n\u2019 spicy chicken\u2019 any day.\n\nIt was as though he stood in between a vast brazen desert with the sun assaulting his body, and a mountainous icy hellscape of a screeching, twisting blizzard. From above, a massive ball of ice and fire came bearing down over him-a comet! It was absolute nirvana!\n\nHe looked around, hoping he\u2019d spot Fang somewhere in this chaotic fever dream of a food high. And sure enough, there she was, having taken a big bite out of her burger. Her eyes were glistening with a tint of orange-redness. And better yet, she was flying!\n\nThey looked at each other, mouths full of drool from excessive savoring of their burger. And slowly drawn close to one another as they clasp their hands together.

Except for the other human and purple saurian who looked like they had also experienced a moment of nirvana.\n\n\u201cHey bros, I know ya\u2019ll like my burgers and sauce and everything like that but\u2026 can you stand down from there?

Your fingers look raw as fuck.\" Fang strums the strings of her guitar one last time before placing it down, resting the neck against her bed. I do the same, minus the strumming as my fingertips are red from the hours of abuse.\n\n\"Wouldn't be like this if you weren't such a slave driver of a teacher. A good one, but still, piss off.\" She lets out a devilish snicker at my back-handed compliment, elbowing in the shoulder lightly. Still exhausted, I let myself fall back into her bed, my brows now furrow in thought as I start thinking.\n\nIt's nice to be able to meet up with Fang again, especially since we hadn't seen each other for a week. A voluntary choice on both of our ends, as we decided it was best to wait out the rest of her estrus before hanging out. As good as the sex was, and as tempting as fucking each others brains out on a daily basis was to the both of us, we decided that her father finding out and caving my bald head in with a nine iron really wasn't worth it.\n\nMy mind attempts to wander back a bit farther, but it's interrupted as I suddenly notice Fang's face looming over mine, a dangerous smirk spread across her beak. \"Well, thinking about it, I wouldn't be a good teacher if I didn't reward my student, so how about I let you do something kinky?\"\n\nI shoot up near instantly, the ptero barely managing to get out of the way in time to prevent us from bumping heads. \"Are you messing with me, or you mean it?\". There's a mix of nervousness and excitement in my voice as I stare her dead in the eyes.\n\n\"Y-Yeah. So uh, you got any ideas?\" The bravado and confidence in her voice just moments before  is suddenly missing. She places a hand in my lap almost expectedly, but I'm already lost in thought as I try to recall something.\n\nEver since our first time, I've been looking for tips to use in the future on my Chinese Cartoon Torrenting Site. A lot of it seemed... Dubious at best, but there's currently one that sticks out in my mind.\n\nI reach out and grab Fang by her shoulders, bringing her closer as I autistically blurt \"I'm going to dominate you.\" Her face goes beat red, and I can feel that she's about to open her mouth to say something. I can't have her doing that though, that'd ruin everything.\n\nI unhinge my jaw and take in the tip of Fang's snoot into my mouth before sliding further down her length. The blush on her cheeks is replaced by an annoyed scowl on her face from this stupid idea, but it soon fades into a once of what I assume is amusement. It's kind of hard to tell with most of her mouth down my throat at the moment.\n\nI give an experimental suck, which gets a giggle out of her, and I instantly figure out the problem with this arrangement. If she moves her mouth, it pushes against my teeth and jaws, and that actually really hurts. But if I stop now, I'm just going to look like an idiot, so fuck that. I continue sucking and sliding my mouth up and down her beak, getting more giggles and more pushing against my jaw for my trouble. There's a smug look in her eyes, and now I know she's doing this on purpose.\n\nThat's it, I'm not going to be mocked any longer. I'm going to show this beautiful ptero bitch that I'm an alpha caveman. Pulling up my metaphorical britches, I take as much of her snout as I can into my throat and then some, nearly gagging as the only sort of training I've had for this was deepthroating a banana once in middle school. I feel kind of slightly accomplished about how much I'm able to fit in my virgin mouth, but that feeling is short-lived as I feel something warm and slimy wiggle deep into my throat.\n\nI begin to sputter and choke, pushing Fang away and out of my maw as she begins full on laughing, tears rolling down her face as her chest heaves heavily. \"Hahaha holy shit Anon, what the fuck did you think was gonna happen!?\"\n\n\"Did you just fucking shoot a salty surprise down my gullet!? The fuck???\" The coughing has subsided, but I'm still rubbing my throat to try and get rid of the weird sticky feeling. She grins, sticking out her tongue in response, and probably the answer as I finally understand what just violated me.\n\nShe waits for me to fully calm down, before picking up her guitar again, plucking a few of the strings with her claws. \"Anyway, I think that's enough of a reward for now... So what part of the song were we on again?\". Fang pauses, scratching her neck in thought for a bit before remembering.\n\n\"Oh, yeah. We're starting off from 'Like a million faces'. \"","Title":"The Karma Snootra","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"The Trip Of A Lifetime Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Fang","The Trip Of A Lifetime Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: The Trip of a Lifetime\nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Fang, Ripley, Samantha, Naser, Reed, Trish, Naomi, Rosa, Stella and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: PogBot 9000\n\n\nMy time at Volcano High may have been short, but the memories I made were well worth it. At least, in the terms of attaining the coveted smol tiddy ptero Gee Eff. So that was pretty cool. Coulda done without the spaghetti moments and the humiliation, face fucking that bollard, nearly getting murdered by my GF's brother and dad but whatever, it's over now and all that matters is getting my diploma so I could get the fuck out. It was hard to believe all the drama I had gone through, both in my previous school and here at Volcano High. At least it was all going to be behind me; a closing of one chapter of my life, and the beginning of a newer, brighter one.\n\nBefore the gathering of the seniors in the rockball field, Fang and I had congregated out in the hall, plucking each of our friends (and the neon nepotist) out of the sea of cartoon characters as they passed by until we had our full squad of retards, all with gowns and caps in our arms making our way to the locker rooms.\n\n\"Finally! I was starting to think this school year was just a massive fever dream. I don't know how I managed to make it through this hellhole without going on a rampage.\" Said Fang, clutching her gown and cap to her chest while giving me a relieved smile. \"I guess I got a dweeb like you to keep me entertained.\"\n\n\"Hah, yeah. I can't imagine what it would look like having an emo dino commit a national tragedy.\" I replied, giving a nervous chuckle and side eye to her. \n\nFucking hell, I don't even wanna relive those nightmares I was having when we first started dating. Every couple of nights I would wake up in the middle of the night soaked with sweat at the thought of Fang losing her shit and going postal on the school. It was always the same line of events: Fang deciding to go back to VVurm Drama's shitty roots after her guitar went out of action, getting utterly humiliated at the prom, us getting in a big fight, only for her to start gunning down anyone she saw in the halls. Even her own fucking brother. And no matter how hard I tried, it would end the same way: That broken smile burning itself in my mind as I called out, no, begged her not to jump from the very roof we shared our most intimate moment, only for her to take the final leap, and for me to see her as nothing more than a granite headstone next to the sibling that cared so much for her, rotting away in the ground, and leaving me a broken husk of a man. The one person I grew to love, was gone.\n\n\nAnd it was all my fault.\n\nEvery.\n\nDamn.\n\nTime.\n\n\nA familiar feathered elbow jabbed me in my ribcage, snapping me back to reality as I nearly shoved a wheelchair-bound paraplegic down the stairs. Something I'd probably have to commit sudoku over to atone for my autistic sins.\n\n\"Hey dweeb, what's with the water works? Are you really gonna miss this place?\" Fang asked, giving me an unimpressed look that was betrayed by a glimmer of concern.\n\nThink, Anon. Think! Don't let her think you're some kind of schizo.\n\n\"Y-you too.\"\n\nFuck.\n\n\"I mean, yeah kinda.\" Saved it. \"I mean, it's where I met my friends... And the Gee Eff of my dreams.\" I cleared my watered eyes with the back of my wrist\n\nThere's that smile again. That god damned smile.\n\n\"Sh-shut up, Anon. Or I'll make you suck face with that bollard again.\"\n\n\"I can't believe I missed that, too. Mind re-enacting it, Fang?\" Trish asked, that smug face of hers still annoying as shit even after we learned to forgive each other during Prom.\n\n\"Fuck off, trigga-lipped bitch.\" I retorted.\n\nThe back of my knee was suddenly kicked, nearly causing me to share a similar fate to that incident after my darkest secret was exposed. \"Shut up, skinnie retard.\"\n\n\"Come on, mi compadres.\" The skunked-up raptor chimed. \"Can we just love each other like proper friends on our last day?\" Reed had a point. Trish and I should be nicer to one another. I mean, we were. But there was still a bit of underlying animosity that hadn't properly worked itself out. Miles of progress were made but we were still ruthless with each other. Maybe that was just our dynamic.\n\nRounding the final corner, Rosa poked her head into the women's locker room, kicking the door open when it was determined the coast was clear.\n\n\"Vamos! We don't have all day! Come come, we need to get changed!\" Said the big tiddy Latina dino.\n\n\"Fang, this doesn't seem right.\" The whipped brother whined. \"Aren't you afraid Spears will catch us and delay our graduation?\"\n\n\"Shut up, fucked wing retard. No one cares about what happens on the last day of school. Not even Spears. I was in here a like an hour ago and walked in on one of the air head cheerleaders having a train run on her. Saw like 4 teachers there too. Was weird as fuck though. You can even see where it happened right over there.\" Fang said, nodding at one of shower stalls which was clearly only haphazardly cleaned, some of the aftermath still stained on the tile flooring.\n\nWalking by Fang, I was pecked on the cheek by that loveable snoot, a half-muted \"Mwah!\" coming from my ptero waifu. Our robes fitted over our clothing easily, so getting them thrown on was a painless endeavor, the only thing hindering us changing being the constant bickering of the creamsicle Caesar and her bussy-starved boyfriend, and the occasional blathering of the weeb stego to me as she talked about the new box sets she just got of her obscure anime. Wait, did she just mention Bocu no Dino? Gross.\n\nBeing the first ones done, Fang and I naturally gravitated toward each other, idly talking about our plans for tonight.\n\n\"Okay, so I'm thinking we head down to the beach and get a bonfire going. I know this nice little spot where we can be as rowdy as we want and we shouldn't have many prying eyes creeping on a bunch of graduated high schoolers. I got liquor from my dad's cabinet ready to go.\"\n\n\"Y-your dad? Isn't he gonna start a manhunt for you if he finds out you're drinking with your skinnie boyfriend?\"\n\n\"Nah, it'll be fine. He already started warming up to you after the glowing reviews from my mom.\"\n\n\"So he likes me now?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But I thought-\"\n\n\"He said he'd mount your head on a trophy plaque. He moved away from skinning you to make a new caddy!\"\n\n\"R-right...\" I mean, I guess that's some kind of improvement, right?\n\n\"What? You're still scared of him? Stop being a pussy. You're a big guy.\"\n\n\"For you.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nI really should take a longer break from my Korean plumbing forum. My shitposts are starting to seep into the real world. But fuck, it's so hilarious seeing a bunch of autists going Gosling over not having their own ptero gf. Checking my favorite Bosnian Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 channel, I see the sticky has grown to thousands of posts and multiple hundreds of images, half of them being Goslings and weird rants about NTR or some shit. And apparently they've fallen in love with the crippled girl I nearly knocked down the stairs as well. Maybe I should tell her she has her own fans if I see her again. Maybe. A moment or two later, the Fang gang was sporting their matching gowns, caps perched atop their weirdly shaped heads with tassels dangling in their faces, marching in a Band of Brothers-esque line, but with WWII soldiers being replaced by a band of Crayola-vomit dinos and their token, diversity hire skinnie. Though that didn't spoil the moment.\n\n\n...\n\n\nThe rockball field was packed with soon-to-be graduates, at least a couple hundred of them, with many more parents and friends crammed in the mixture of bleachers and stadium seats. The candy commissar gave a cookie cutter valedictory, with her salutatorian boyfriend standing just off to the side of her trying to support her as the student body was left impatiently waiting to get their diplomas and bounce. Following the speeches was the handing of diplomas, each student called one by one to receive their framed document certifying their most basic life achievement, then flipping their tassel right to left. The whole ordeal seemed to drag on, the applause of students, parents, and faculty quickly beginning to die off to meager claps, crescendoed by the occasional whoops and cheers for the popular graduates. In an ironic twist of fate, Fang had received a rather uproarious (heh) ovation, no thanks to her sublime performance at the prom. Despite her fiery attitude and her comfort during stage performances, she was ill-prepared for such a fanfare. Immediately, her face was flushed red, the spaces below her eyes radiating a bright, cherry red as she seized up, diploma in-hand. Our eyes locked, and in that moment, Fang seemed to be put at ease. Her shoulders relaxed, her fingers unfurled from their fists, as she saw me practically having a meltdown for her. With a renewed excitement, she waved directly at me, never really breaking eye contact until she left the stage to join me. Once my turn came up, I took to the stage, greeted by the quiet snickers and isolated applause of the student body, who had clearly never forgotten that incident in the auditorium. However, the motley crew of rejects more than made up for the lack of celebration, as they cheered me on, Fang practically carrying them in their cheers and applause as she went fucking ballistic for me. God damn, no wonder I love her so much. And at least her mother was there to cheer me on too. That sweet ol' woman juxtaposing her imposing husband as he simply stared laser beams at me, though with only slightly less intensity than he usually did. With the final diplomas handed out and the closing speech given, Fang reached her hand out to mine, her gentle touch bringing about a little heat under my eyes, spaghetti only barely falling out of my pockets as we took our caps off and prepared to send them flying. On the mark of the valedictorian, we sent our caps sky high, a skull-splitting cheer booming through the stadium as we performed the final ritual of our graduation, the school band playing the our anthem which served as the backdrop for the celebrations. Before the caps even began to fall, Fang and I turned toward each other, sharing a moment of serenity which was peaked by her feathery arms wrapping around the back of my neck, her wings circling around me, and my own arms looping around the small of her back, our lips meeting in a celebratory kiss as I lifted her off her feet and twirled her around, the world around us melting as the only thing that seemed to matter to either of us was each other. My joy easily eclipsed the one I had when Fang and I first realized we loved each other. And now that the final chapter in my high school life had closed, my life with Fang had only just opened up.\n\n\nTogether, we would take on the world.\n\n\n...\n\n\nThe evening air was beginning to cool down, the bon fire I started bringing a comforting heat to us. Fang settled next to me, our hands finding recluse in my lap while her head rested on my shoulder, our fingers interlaced and occasionally brushing along the backs of each other's hands. The drinks were flowing, the collective alcohol content of our blood was spiking, and the day was giving away to a beautiful sunset, bringing about the shroud of night as we all reminisced about the memories we shared, half of which I was not around for on account of coming to Volcano High so late in the year. However, most of the stories had me as a key part in them, such as the time I taught Fang how to build a railgun, or when Reed and I grabbed each other's bags. My involvement in the conversations began to die down, along with Fang as we more or less talked with one another, cherishing every moment we were holding each other.\n\n\"What are you planning on doing now that you're graduated, Anon?\" Fang asked, those deep amber eyes of hers practically melting my heart as she looked up at me.\n\n\"I'm not sure. I'm just taking things one step at a time. It's either going to college or joining the military, at the moment.\" Fang's grip on my hand tightened at the mentioning of the latter option. \"But right now, I just want to enjoy the freedom I have while we're still in summer. What about you, pirate princess Lucy?\"\n\nThat one earned me a harsh jab to the same spot on my ribcage. With all the times I've been elbowed in that same spot, I'm surprised I don't have a permanent bruise.\n\n\"Debating what I wanna do with my life. Trish and Reed think VVurm Drama can make it big, but right now, I just don't wanna have to worry about anything right now. I'd rather just spend my time with you, Anon.\"\n\nI squeezed her hand, my other hand cupping her cheek as I planted a kiss on the top of her snoot, her nose giving an adorable little wiggle.\n\n\"I'd spend my whole life with you in a heartbeat.\" That earned a good tail thumping from the ptero.\n\n\"Anon...\"\n\nBefore Fang could finish what she wanted to say, Rosa chimed in with her usual heavily Latina accent. \"Mi amigas! Mi amigos! Our yearbooks! We should be signing them!\"\n\nEach of our yearbooks were passed around, each person getting a chance to leave a special message for one another for them to read; a final note being passed to around as a way to express feelings for those who had trouble saying it aloud. Most of the messages I wrote in the gang's yearbooks were at least moderately special to each person, aside from Naomi, who got a generic \"Good luck on your ventures!\"-type message from me, and likely everyone else. Trish got a \"Fuck you, trigga-lipped meteor dodger.\u2665 - Anon\" At least the heart would show I wasn't really mad at her anymore. My yearbook had a similar message that said \"Fuck you, skinnie faggot. I hope a spear gets crammed down your pisshole.\u2665 - Trish\". Ah, friendship. Eventually, it came down to just Fang and I, as if we both had planned on having each other sign our yearbooks last. Passing our books towards each other, I took a moment to skim through the words of encouragement left by our friends. Trish leaving a block of text that had to do with her giving an apology, followed by words of sincerity and hoping they could put everything behind them, Reed leaving some surprisingly profound words of wisdom, Rosa and Stella leaving their own related messages, even Naser and Naomi, the latter of which really just having her name daintily written. Finally, it was my turn to leave the girl of my dreams a message for her to read throughout her years. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Fang was already slaving away, a whole page being the canvas for which she laid down her creation.\n\nFuck, I don't know what to put. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK- wait. I got it!\n\nTurning over a page, I work on my magnum opus, my pen gliding across the paper in smooth strokes as I bring to life my own creation, pouring my heart and my absolute fucking soul into my work. Fang had already finished and was waiting on me, the entire time consisting of her trying to get a sneak peek, which was met by either a closing of the book with a following death glare, or turning my back to her in an effort to keep my work a secret until I was ready to show her. However, the feathery fiend had other plans, as she literally began to crawl all over me, sticking her snoot into every hole of my defense, which was met with pushes and bops to her nose. This only seemed to drive her further, her hands finding their way under my shirt as she tickled at my stomach, earning spastic convulsions as I desperately fought her off. Yet somehow I still managed to keep her at bay long enough to put the finishing touches on my masterpiece, shoving the book against her chest after closing it up.\n\n\"Okay, okay, I'm done! Take it!\"\n\nFang hurriedly opened the yearbook back up, immediately flipping to the page I was working on where she began to examine it thoroughly, throwing my yearbook at my head with a -PLONK!-. \u200bTurning to the final page, I got a good look at the message she left. Actually, it wasn't just a message, it was a whole drawing!\n\nIt was a drawing of Fang's favorite moment with me. It was the time I went to her house to study, only for her to end up showing me how to play guitar, right down to the minutia of detail, her hands on top of mine, guiding me across the fretboard as she showed me a couple chords. Fuck, I remember that day as if it were yesterday. My heart was beating out of my chest, my palms were sweaty, knees weak, arms were heavy. And the feeling of her arms wrapped around me in such a wonderful embrace, I felt like I was up in the clouds with not a care in the world. Truth be told, I didn't care if her dad was going to use my asshole as his golf caddy. It was so fucking worth it just to be held like that. My only regret was that it didn't last longer. I didn't realize it until just now but I was wearing the widest grin imaginable, my eyes were even beginning to water recollecting that tender moment. I REALLY need that again. The bottom of the page served as a footnote, containing the parting words to an already frameable work of art. \n\n\"You're strap to my guitar, the cable to my amp, the mic to my voice, and the light to my stage. Without you supporting me every step of the way, I wouldn't be where I am today. Every hug you gave, every smile you beamed, every tear you've shed, and every kiss we've shared, has been the best gift I've come to cherish. I love you, Anon. And I always will.\" The final mark on the paper being a small sketch of our kiss at the prom.\n\nI was beginning to regret that I didn't put something nearly as nice as that. Maybe it's not too late to snatch that yearbook from her to re-do everything. Never mind, she's been staring at that page the entire time.\n\n\"Anon...\"\n\nFuck.\n\n\"This is the best thing I've ever seen in my entire fucking life.\"\n\nThank you, Raptor Jesus.\n\nFang turned the book towards our circle of friends.\n\nIt was a crudely drawn sketch of Fang sitting at a table devouring a massive plate of dino nuggies, with me emaciated and crawling towards her, begging. \"Please, I'm starving. Just give me a couple...\" Only for her to respond with \"Mine!\" And kicking me in the face. The message at the bottom read: \"Seriously, please stop eating all my food. - Anon\"\n\nApparently that was enough to get a kick out of everyone, as they all shared smirks and giggles with one another, especially Fang, who had to be so boisterous about it that I was beginning to think we were going to have cops roll up any second. But she ended her laughter with her hand touching my cheek to guide me into a kiss, which I happily reciprocated. The night went on without a hitch, the last of the drinks being had an hour or two later, with most everyone at some stage of inebriation, except for the prom king and queen, who were given non-alcoholic drinks the entire time, yet still acted as if they were black-out drunk. Might as well tell them tomorrow. No point in spoiling the mood for the lovebirds on their best night.\n\nGiving our final waves and hugs goodbye, everyone went their separate ways, leaving the fire as nothing more than smoldering embers. Naser and Naomi took the NasCar home, while everyone else simply walked their own ways, leaving just Fang and I, walking shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, as I took her back home. The walk was silent, but heavy in a shared intimacy, our hands beginning to stir and squeeze one another. In the midst of our moonlit walk, I suddenly remembered something. Fang was going to say something before Rosa got us all to sign our yearbooks.\n\n\"Fang?\"\n\nShe looked up at me from my shoulder, her amber eyes being illuminated by the passing street lights. \"Hmm?\"\n\n\"What were you about to say to me? By the fire.\"\n\nShe gave a puzzled look up at me, her face then blinking into a look of realization. \"Ooooh, that! On second thought, I'll tell you tomorrow. It's a surprise I don't want to spoil.\"\n\n\"C'mon pleeeeeeeeeease? I wanna know right now!\"\n\n\"Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnope.\" She replied, a cheeky grin painted across her face.\n\nI rolled my eyes and gave a defeated sigh, earning a consoling kiss to my cheek from the long snoot of the ptero. Finally, our walk had ended, leaving us at the welcome mat of Fang's home, the lights inside still on with the porch light giving us our own little spotlight to share in the otherwise dark evening. We turned in tandem to face each other, our arms finding their usual places on our bodies: hers around my neck, and mine around her back, as we pulled each other in, heads canting to perform a deeper kiss that neither of us wanted to break. The ptero's tongue slipped into my mouth and her arms coiled in tighter, squeezing me to her body as I returned a similar gesture, as if accepting her challenge to see who would win this fight. At first, I was beginning to think I was about to win this engagement, seeing how she stirred in my grasp and her hold faltered for a second, but I never accounted on her teeth suddenly latching onto my bottom lip, which was then drawn back and let go so as to snap back into place. That look in her eyes... It wasn't your typical 'I love you' stare. This was straight up bedroom eyes. I had never seen that look before, so I had nothing to compare it to. But somehow, deep down, I knew that was the look. Just as I was diving in for round two, my attention was snapped to a hulking figure that was standing before us. It was Fang's dad. My pants immediately grew heavier as my pants became sodden. That murderous stare was burning a hole in my skull. He already wasn't a fan of me, but now he looked like he was about to tear my head off while I still clung to Fang. It also didn't help that, along with seeing me suck face with his daughter, one of Fang's legs was wrapped around my waist. Fang shoved me off of her when she realized her dad was staring at us.\n\n\"Stop trying to scare, Anon! It's not going to work!\"\n\nSpeak for yourself, the dude looks like he could cave my skull in by patting my head.\n\n\"I-it's okay Fang. I need to bounce anyway.\" I said, brushing my sweaty hands off on my jeans.\n\nShe gave me a final peck on the cheek, and was promptly dragged inside, the door slamming shut as her father had seen enough of me for the day, leaving me to walk to my shitty apartment on Skin Row, which was made noticeably less shitty with the constant back and forth texts with my girlfriend.\n\n\n...\n\n\nI was thrown out of bed by the annoyingly loud ring of my phone, headbutting the floor, and groaning as I felt around until I was able to find my phone and answer the call.\n\n\"Hellooooooooo?\"\n\n\"Hey dweeb, get over here. We need to talk. I got something you need to see.\" \n\nBefore I could even ask her what it was about, she hung up. God damn it, I hate it when she does this shit. Whatever, I get to see her and that's all that matters. Throwing on my usual outfit, I went out and took the bus which took me right to the outskirts of the neighborhood Fang lived in, the rest of the journey being a short walk to her upscale house, which now bore the blemish of another car parked in her driveway. More specifically 2 new blemishes: A fucking hippy van and a shiny metal camper van, with the unmistakable silhouette of my ptero gf moving around in the windows. Circling around, I stepped into the odd-smelling camper and see Fang digging through the small cupboards.\n\n\"Uh, Fang? Where the fuck did you get a Volkswagen Type 2 and a fucking Airstream?\"\n\n\"You know how dad is a police commissioner?\"\n\n\"Yeeeeeah?\" I responded looking around the surprisingly well-kept interior, save for a couple scratches and stains here and there.\n\n\"And you remember how they busted up a meth lab a couple weeks ago?\"\n\n\"Yeah, why do-... Wait, your dad gave you a fucking meth lab van?\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't necessarily say 'gave'. More like 'I had mom harass him until he relented and gifted it to me as an early graduation present'. And I've been fixing it up for the past couple weeks.\"\n\n\"And why these specifically?\"\n\n\"Because we're going on a road trip.\"\n\n\"Oh nice, I always wanted to- A ROADTRIP?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Fang tossed a beaker into the trash bag at her feet, promptly shattering it before she moved on to another set of cupboards, her cute little tail whipping side to side.\n\n\"Wh-where to?\"\n\n\"Dunno. Wherever we want, probably.\"\n\n\"We? You're taking me with you?\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't I take my own boyfriend? Plus it's not just gonna be us. Got the whole gang coming too.\"\n\n\"And they all agreed?\"\n\n\"Yes, retard.\"\n\n\"Why a road trip though? Why now?\"\n\nFang removed herself from the cupboard, throwing a couple loose papers and various odds and ends into the garbage bag and then taking a seat at the dining table, tapping her foot on the seat across from her.\n\n\"Anon, you remember that thing you said by the bon fire? That whole 'I'd spend my whole life with you in a heartbeat' thing?\"\n\nOh yeah, I did say that. And I meant it too.\n\n\"Yeah, I do. Why, planning out marriage out already?\" Fang's face became a bit flushed with red at the jovial teasing.\n\n\"No, dipshit. What I mean is...\" She rubbed her face, practically wiping away the blush like makeup. \"What I mean is that we've got, what, 3 months of absolute freedom before before we have to actually become adults? Anon, I don't want to grow up just yet. I wanna enjoy every second I have with my friends... With you.\" Her voice began to break as she fought back visible tears. \"I really, REALLY don't want to have to deal with adult life just yet. I just wanna properly enjoy myself. No school, no worries, nothing. Just my closest friends and my boyfriend.\"\n\nIt was easy to see she was really longing to spend time with everyone she loved, me especially. The way her eyes pleaded with me, the way her voice faltered as she started thinking through all the growing up she was going to have to do. I might still be learning empathy from her, but even I could picture myself being the same way. Growing up fucking sucks. As much as I hated being in school, I could at least be irresponsible without much in the way of consequences. Being an adult wouldn't really afford me that luxury. Honestly, I wasn't ready to grow up either. I just want to enjoy my youth while I still have it, and enjoy it with the only girl I've ever loved, outside of my waifus.\n\n\"Anon... Will you come with me? I'm not doing this unless you're here with me.\"\n\n\"Fang. You can't be serious...\" That look she gave me. It was the thing of nightmares. It was like I just told her I don't want to see her again. I REALLY need to work on my phrasing. \"You think I would miss spending my summer with you? I'm in.\"\n\nIn the span of a nanosecond I was torn out of my seat and swept up in a feathery blanket, even being lifted off my feet as she shook me around, squealing in delight, which brought more joy to me than it really had any right to. After spending a couple perfect moments in her grasp, our arms loosened, my hands finding her hips while hers rested on my shoulders.\n\n\"Good. Now help me clean up. We still got time to prepare and get the things we need.\" She said, pecking a kiss on my lips.\n\nGuess my new adventure was just beginning.","Title":"The Trip of a Lifetime","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Fang, Ripley, Samantha, Naser, Reed, Trish, Naomi, Rosa, Stella and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"PogBot 9000"},"The Trip Of A Lifetime Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Fang","The Trip Of A Lifetime Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"It had only been a couple days, and already, Fang and I were making great progress, which was only furthered by the additional helping hands from our friend group whenever they decided to show up, though it was mostly the work of just the two of us. Fortunately, the rest of the gang would occasionally swing by and drop off some much needed supplies that we'd keep in the chest freezer and the fridge in the garage. Clearing the last of the junk from the cupboards and drawers, I dumped it all into a large garbage bag and tossed it into the every growing pile we had built up in the front yard, to the ire of the HOA. Fuck the HOA by the way. Along with the occasional helping hand, I was always under the watchful gaze of the hulking male ptero that was Fang's dad, as there never seemed to be a point he wasn't standing at a window or in the door way, watching me like a hawk. To my detriment, Fang liked to tease me by doing whatever she could to get her father to hate me more, such as bending over in an overt fashion to emphasize her ass sticking out towards me, getting me to stare, which earned a piercing glare at me every time it happened. Not only that, but it seemed like she just couldn't keep her hands off me, ESPECIALLY when we were out in the open, as she greeted me with passing touches and squeezes to various parts of my body, even pinning me to the side of the van and the camper to give me a kiss as if she was about drop her pants right on the spot. Thankfully, it never went beyond that, so I was able to continue living my life with both of my kidneys still inside my body. Though I don't think her dad had the same plans. Brushing my hands off of my jeans, I then got to work on dusting every fucking inch of that camper. Fuck, they may look small, but there's just so much shit to clean in those things. It's kinda tiring. At least Fang was thinking the same thing.\n\n\"Alright, dweeb. Let's take a break. I'm gonna get us some water. BRB.\" She said, stretching her arms over her head then giving me a rub to the top of my skull.\n\nThank fuck, it was fucking baking in there. Stepping out of the camper I got some fresh, meth-free air in my lungs and a cooler breeze on my skin. It was still fucking hot as balls out. But it felt so much nicer to have air circulation. A shame I couldn't enjoy it longer on account of hearing a screaming match in Fang's house. God fucking damn it. Why now? I just wanna have a nice time with her. Is that too much to ask for, Raptor Jesus? Peeking in the living room window, it was a shouting match between Fang and her father (of course it was), the window pane causing some of their words to be muffled, but otherwise it was easy to make out.\n\n\"Why can't you just learn to like him? He's good to me! You have no idea how much he has helped me! Fucking mom likes him!\"\n\nOh fuck, I shoulda figured this was about me. Maybe I shouldn't be listening in on this. Feels kinda wrong. Then again, I snooped through Fang's phone that one time in music class. Fuck, I'm still regretting doing that.\n\n\"I don't fucking trust these skinnies! Especially not ones that have their eyes on my daughter!\"\n\n\"How do you not trust him? He was there for me when I was being gaslit by Trish of all people! Reed was barely any help too!\"\n\n\"Don't even mention that carfentanyl-addicted reject around me, you're lucky I even let him stand on the sidewalk near the house!\"\n\n\"This is why I can't fucking stand being around you! You never let me have friends over, you never let me have my own life, you're so fucking controlling! Don't bother calling me while I'm away unless it's a fucking apology! I don't ever wanna fucking see you again! I. HATE. YOU.\"\n\nThat look in her eyes. It was like she just spoke with the fury of a thousand suns going super nova. And the patriarch felt the heat. I had never seen a face like that on such a grizzled old man. Not even old war vets recalling their stories usually get that look in their eyes. As Fang stomped off into the kitchen, her dad was left in the living room, head sagged and eyes welling up slightly with an increased dampness, then trudging upstairs. Fucking hell, there was something about seeing a hulking old man be broken like that. The door leading to the garage began to creak open and I darted back to the camper. She'd be super fucking pissed if she caught me eavesdropping on her like that.\n\n\"Ugh, sorry I took so long. Naser was being a bitch like always. I got us some water and a speaker though!\" She said, back to her normal chipper attitude when she was around me. Though I did notice her eyeliner was running a little bit, which she was quick to pick up on. \"Oh, don't worry, Anon. Just sweat making my makeup run. It's hot as tits out.\" She added, tossing an icy bottle of water at me then turning on her bluetooth speaker. \"Got any songs you wanna hear?\"\n\nI gave a thought for a moment, but resigned to letting Fang play what she wanted. \"Can't think of anything off the top of my head. Just play what you want.\"\n\n\"Deal. You're gonna love my Snootify playlist. I got some of the best shit to listen to. Especially on the road trip.\"\n\nKicking things off was some surprisingly good indie rock. Never really was a fan of that genre but hey, there's a first time for everything.\n\n\"Fuuuuuuuuck I love The Black Keys. I got to see them in concert last year. Sucks I didn't get an autograph from them though. I hope we manage to catch them while they're on tour.\"\n\nAt least Fang was quickly beginning to cheer up. To the beat of the song she'd whap her tail about, along with swinging her hips as she danced and cleaned at the same time. Hell, even my foot was tapping and my head was bobbing as I dusted the counters and fridge, working even quicker thanks to the tempo the music provided. I even got a bit of a show as she started to sing and put more movement into her dancing which made the movements of her cleaning more exaggerated.\n\n\"There comes a time, two hearts of gooooold~...\"\n\nFuck, her voice is so beautiful. I want her to sing me a lullaby every night while I lay my head in her lap. Her voice carries this almost angelic tone to it, the way it rings in my head like a church bell on wedding day. It's so much different from the usual belting she does when she plays in her band. The her voice on stage is perfectly fine but... holy shit, does she not realize what she sounds like?\n\n\"Leave together, run forever on the open roooooooad~...\" Oh god here comes the drop, I can feel it in my bones.\n\n\"They gotta gooooo oooh-ooh-ohoh! Gooooo ohoh-oooooh-ohoh-ohooooh~!\"\n\nSuddenly she's coming towards me, taking my hands as I still hold a rag while she jumps around in circles. This cleaning really isn't going to be getting done any time soon, but that's not my biggest concern at the moment. I joined her in the jumping and dancing, even laughing as she continued to more or less serenade me with her beautiful voice, her amber eyes glowing whenever she opened them, the constant twirling causing the glimmer in her eyes to dance around and shine. But just as quickly as she took my hands in dance, she went back to cleaning the front end of the camper, still dancing and singing while she did, which I was sure to capture with a pic on my phone before returning to the dusting I still needed to do. Once the dusting was finished, we busted out the bleach and sprays and were deep cleaning everything in site, her Snootify playlist still rolling through tracks that consisted of some Indie shit with spots of legitimate heavy metal and then random surges of the most quintessential early-2000s pop. It was hard to put into words just what that meant, but everyone knew it when they heard it. As the day dragged on and the temperature started to fall, we managed to power through the rest of the cleaning, the only thing that needed to be done was replacing the mattresses, both the main and the foldouts.\n\n\"Alright, Anon. I think we can stop here for now. We can pick up the mattresses tomorrow. I'm fuckin' starving. I'm thinkiiiiiiiiing... Chinese food. What say you?\"\n\nThe thought of getting some heart stopping, MSG-riddled food gets my stomach rumbling up a storm. It really does sound good as fuck right now. Shit, thinking about it now, I hadn't eaten all day\n\n\"Honestly, I could go for some Chinese. Whatcha thinking of? Ptero Express? Buffet?\"\n\n\"DEFINITELY buffet. I could eat a whole cow right about now.\"\n\nHonestly that would be a pretty cool thing to see.\n\n\"I'm down. Where we going?\"\n\nFang threw her dirty cleaning rag into the sink, snatching mine from my hand and doing the same.\n\n\"Lil Troo. It's close to where we had our first date.\"\n\n\"You considered that our first date?\" I asked, genuinely shocked she had said such a thing. I mean, her Uncle Moe called it a date and I was kinda thinking the same way, but I never thought she considered it as such.\n\n\"Yeah. Why, don't you?\" She asked, taking me by the wrist and guiding me out of the camper to start our walk.\n\n\"I mean, sure. I just didn't think YOU did. I thought you just intended it to be a hunt for a venue for your band.\"\n\n\"I did, but when I went for a smoke I started thinking about breaking off from Naser and his bitch to spend time with you... Ya know, while we looked for a venue.\"\n\n\"Clever girl...\"\n\nFang beamed at me. \"I know I am.\" She said, sticking her tongue out at me, giving a playful elbow to my ribcage. I'm almost certain by now that I will have a permanent bruise on my ribcage. The things I do for love.\n\n\"So have you made any plans yet on what you wanna see during the trip?\" I asked, resting an arm across her shoulder, an arm from Fang slipping around my hip as we walk.\n\n\"Honestly, not really. I was thinking we just go with the flow and see where the road takes us, though...\" She stops talking, her voice trailing off as she gave a short thought at my question. \"There's a couple places I think I'd definitely wanna see. I was thinking maybe Las Vegas? NYC? San Fran and LA? Ya know, all those touristy places.\"\n\nI wanted to vomit at the mentioning of California. But I put on a brave face and pretend like the idea of setting foot in that cesspit of a state.\n\n\"Alright, and what are you hoping to see otherwise?\" I asked, guiding us around a corning, bringing us to the very entrance of Lil Troo in all its glitz and ostentatious glamour before letting Fang take the lead.\n\n\"Maybe some mountain ranges? Peep the Mojave, go camping a couple times. Visit a couple concerts. The sky's the limit!\"\n\nThe word 'Mojave' reminded me of one of my favorite games. Fallout: Snoot Vegas. Shit, I love that game. It would be a perfect opportunity to see all the landmarks and shit they used for the game. Fuck yeah, I'm down for Vegas.\n\n\"Fucking send it, bro. I like the sound of that.\"\n\nIt was only a matter of time before we came across the Chinese place, the smell emanating from the grease-lined walls enough to where I could find the place by sense of smell alone. Shoving the door open, we went inside and were promptly seated, only for use to get right back up and start stacking our plates high with some of the world's unhealthiest food imaginable, a mixture of noodles, various beef and chicken dishes, and an ungoldy amount of egg rolls. Fuck, I love egg rolls. Even with chopsticks, Fang was powering through her mountain of food, while I had barely even made a dent in mine. Bitch really could pack away the food. Guess I shoulda known by now when we were at Dino-Moe's.\n\nI slurped up some of my noodles. \"So when do you expect us to be hitting the road?\" I took a sip of my drink.\n\nFang wiped her mouth with a napkin. \"2? 3 days maybe? Gives us a bit more time to have the gang round up their shit and get it packed away. After that, we leave this this dump and we start our adventure.\" She leaned back, crossing one leg over the other. \"Fuck, I can't wait to leave. I've been wanting to get out since freshman year. I could use a break from all this stress.\"\n\n\"What about after this road trip is done? What then?\"\n\nFang kicked my shin, causing me to nearly leap out of my seat. \"I got 3 months before I even need to start planning for that shit. Don't spoil the moment.\"\n\nI suppose she's right. I just can't help but think it's a bit reckless not to at least make a plan. Sure, I'm not the best person to consult for career advice, but even I know it's important to make a plan. But I'd really rather not stress her out more than she already is. After that screaming match she had with her dad, I can only imagine she's in a bad spot and doesn't want her evening with me to end on a downer.\n\nI drop it and change the subject, taking a couple more bites of heart-clogging goodness, noticing Fang has nearly finished her plate. \"So you think the gang is looking forward to this as much as you?\"\n\n\"I mean, if they said yes, I'd fucking hope so. Reed and Trish I knew would wanna come, and when Rosa and Stella said yes I was kinda surprised. I didn't think they'd want to. Unfortunately, the universe decided to curse me and now my brother and his bimbo girlfriend are coming with us.\" She said, sounding a bit despondent. Fuck, even I wasn't really looking forward to that. I'm fine with Naser but fucking Naomi? Fucking hell, I'm gonna need to pack some extra Tylenol.\n\n\"Wait, why are THEY coming?\" I asked, referring to Naser and Naomi.\n\n\"Mom said it would be nice of me to invite them. I invited Naser, hoping if I made it sound like it would be a drag he wouldn't come. But here we are, trying to fit him and his bitch in while we try to have fun. Hopefully it won't be too bad.\" She said going for another plate of food, taking mine with her.\n\nDebatable.\n\nA minute or two later, she was back with another mountain of food on each of the plates, which we immediately start scarfing down like it was our last meal. And you best believe we're taking home food too. Fuck, it's been ages since I had Chinese food, I forgot how good it was.\n\nSpending the next couple minutes in relative silence, we polished off the rest of our food, grabbed takeout, and bounced, enjoying the evening with a nice little walk back to Fang's house, eventually bring her to her front door and giving a parting kiss to her snoot, that same little blush on her face forming. As I turned away, my free wrist was seized in the delicate grip of the Ptero, keeping me in place before looking back at her.\n\n\"Where you going, Anon?\"\n\n\"Back to my apartment, why?\"\n\nFang gave me a rather coquettish grin as she tugged my arm, pulling me back towards her as my feet followed behind. \"How about you stay the night? You've had me at your place, so why not let you stay over at mine?\"\n\nSpaghetti began dribbling out of my pockets. Somehow, after dating her for a few months, she would still do these little things that would make me lose my shit and become the same Anon I was when I had only first met her. \"What uh... What about your dad? He'll kill me i-\"\n\n\"Fuck 'im. He's not gonna kill you if you're with me. I'll fucking make sure of that.\"\n\nHer grip on my wrist tightened as she pulled me closer once again, stacking her Styrofoam takeout box on top of mine and then grabbing her house keys to delicately open the door, bringing me inside and locking it behind us. She snatched the takeout and stuffed them into her already packed fridge, then hurriedly guided me up to her room, the gentle thumps of our feet sounding like bricks being dropped while we tried to stay quite. Once in the relative safety of her room, we began to drop our guard. Fang grabbed a nearby remote and leapt onto her bed, turning on the nearby TV then patting the spot next to her which I happily joined, if only with a little bit of anxiety on account of me being where I'm not supposed to be. Fang scrolled through all the shows and movies on Netstix until she came across Love, Death, and Robots. She peeked over her shoulder at me with a raised brow, gauging my interest at her choice. I had heard good things about LDR, and someone of the things that were told to me sounded pretty interesting to say the least. With a nod I signaled my approval and the show was started.\n\nNot gonna lie, there were some legitimately good episodes. Some of them were just plain awful, but overall, it was something I enjoyed. Maybe because I had my lovely ptero girlfriend in my arms but that's besides the point. There were legitimate gems in there, and any shitty episodes were mocked ruthlessly. ESPECIALLY when it came to the episode where an artist was obsessed with a shade of blue and it turns our he was a pool-cleaning robot before he became an artist. THAT earned our mutual derision.\n\nEventually, torpor started to take over, as it naturally does when given the time. The haze of exhaustion from a day of hard work in the sweltering summer sun was beginning to catch up with me. I should have noticed it earlier when I was yawning every couple of minutes or so, but spending time with Fang made me forget all of that. Weird how being with someone you love makes you forget about your primal needs. There was a stir coming from Fang, and soon one of her hands found mine, her fingers becoming interlaced before she looked over her shoulder at me, her expression cloaked in a mire of longing, and her body following, now facing me. Before I could register her plans, she sealed her lips to mine, relinquishing my hand and replacing hers on my cheek. The moment our lips met, it was like a jolt of electricity woke me, snapping me to my senses and finally registering what was happening. When I was more alert, I was wholeheartedly enthused and joined in, pursing my lips, taking the initiative and allowing my tongue to advance against hers. With flits against her own tongue, it elicited pleased gasp, her fingers clenching against my cheek and my shoulder as she was overcome with intense yearning, desperate for more. Additionally, her own tongue leapt into the fray. One of my hands was raking furrows down her back, causing her to arch and press into me, her fingers growing tighter. The brushing of legs was also a frequent action as the soft grinding of denim against denim made for yet another instrument in our symphony of desire. Periodically, my lip was bitten, tugged, and suckled on by the feathered female. I don't know how I haven't botched the whole thing by saying something inveritably retarded, but I keep the train rolling. No pressure, Anon. \n\nTo my own shock, Fang rolls over on me, settling herself on my waist, making her look like some kind of giantess in the otherwise dark room. Her hair is a bit of a mess on account of the stroking and caressing of each other, but it makes her look so, SO damn beautiful. With half-lidded eyes, she dives right back down, clutching my shirt as she dots my face with affectionate pecks, a nice, passionate kiss to my lips, before proceeding lower. She kissed each of my cheeks, then my chin, and then my throat, my teeth sinking into my bottom lip to stifle a groan which caught the attentive ear of my lover. A devious grin flashed across her face as she exploited my weakness, repeatedly kissing, nipping, even lapping at my throat. I don't know what it is about this that I love. Maybe it has something to do with the fact she could just lock her jaws around my throat and snap my neck, yet she chooses not to. While continuing her assault on my thoat with her affections, her hands began to slip under my shirt and tank top, gliding across my stomach and chest as her delicate fingers more or less traced sigils on my flesh. Her painted nails began raking along my bare flesh, surely leaving scratch marks in their wake as she carved me up like some kind of morsel. It stings. A lot. But my lust-addled mind keeps me under her spell, letting her have her way with me however she so desired.\n\nThe entire time, I had no clue what to do with my hands. I was so transfixed by the ptero-turned-temptress that I merely had my hands on her hips. And before I could even begin to return a modicum of the love she showed me, she gave  me a final kiss on the lips, her body now releasing me from her grasp as she loosened up and laid half on me, her head resting on my chest as my hitched breathing began to return to normal.\n\n\"You'll get your chance one day, Anon.\" She cooed, the TV barely audible in the background as the show continued to play. \"But now, it's time for bed. Sleep tight, dear.\" She murmured, her hand on my chest gently scratching me, soothing me from the delightful sensations as I began to drift unconscious, head practically spinning at what just happened to me."},"The Trip Of A Lifetime Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Fang","The Trip Of A Lifetime Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"Cracking open my eyes, I gave a stretch of my limbs, a wide yawn coming through before I began clearing the drowsiness from my vision. Without a doubt, that was some of the best sleep I had ever had. Something about having the one I love in my embrace while one of her downy wings lay over me just put me at ease and practically made me fall asleep near-instantaneously. I wish I could sleep like that every night. Once the drowsiness was properly cleared from my eyes, I noticed Fang was no longer present, an indent in the mattress left behind along with some of the bedsheets in a bit of a wrinkled mess. I peered at a nearby clock, noticing the time being 07:34. That explained the rays of sunlight peaking through her blackout blinds, which made the room look so much darker, that I thought I slept until the next evening. Swinging my legs off the bed, I got to my feet and padded through the halls and down the stairs, keeping as quiet as I could so as not to wake Fang's parents. As far as they were aware, I was sleeping at my shitty apartment in Skin Row, so getting caught this early in the morning would probably earn me a one-way ticket to being a smear on the wall. Spotting Fang in the kitchen, I noticed digging through the freezer, probably trying to sate her voracious appetite for every dino nuggy in existence. Her attention, however, was turned towards me as one of the steps creaked under my weight, which she greeted me with a smile. \n\n\"Mornin', dweeb. Sleep well?\" She asked, turning back to the freezer, stacking her massive plate with an inordinate amount of dino nuggies.\n\n\"You kidding? I slept like a baby.\" I responded, letting out another yawn.\n\n\"Yeah, I could tell. You drooled all over my wing.\" She responded, popping the stacked plate in the microwave.\n\nDeploying bullshit measures. \"Ah shit, my bad. I was dreaming of, uh, burgers.\" \n\nFang's face contorted into that of amusement, a shake of her head indicating she wasn't believing me. \"Suuure.\"\n\nFang periodically peeked at the spinning plate of nuggets, her attention snapping back to me every moment or two.\n\n\"So what are you looking forward to, Anon?\"\n\n\"Honestly, I wouldn't mind going swimming in a lake or head to the beach or something. I'm down for whatever you wanna do though. Not too picky.\"\n\n\"Good, good. There's so much I wanna do. I think you might like what I have planned. Where you wanna head to first?\"\n\n\"Up to you, really. And where the gang wants to go.\"\n\nFang opened the microwave door, only a couple seconds before it was about go off, setting the plate on the table and beginning to dig in.\n\n\"Reed and Trish got some ideas, I think Stella and Rosa do too. But that's about it. I'm basically running the show. I might throw Naser and Naomi a bone and let them pick something to do if I'm in a good enough mood. Otherwise, they're just getting dragged along for the ride. They'll have to make their own fun or some shit.\"\n\nI tried to sneak a nugget from the massive plate, only to be met with Fang's hand gripping my wrist, squeezing the life out of it as gave me an death glare, like I had just told her I cheated on her. Holy shit she's way stronger than she looks. Oh fuck this actually hurts owowowowowowowoOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW. With a grip like that, I wouldn't be surprised if she could tear my arm clean out of its socket, something which I wasn't willing to experience, not even if it was from my own girlfriend.\n\n\"Okay okay okay! I won't take any nuggets, just let my go!\" I pleaded, trying not to yell at the top of my lungs.\n\n\"Good boy.\" Fang leaned in and kissed my cheek, relinquishing my hand so I could nurse it.\n\n\"You and those fucking nuggets of yours, I swear...\"\n\nShe gave a cheeky grin, resuming polishing off her plate of nuggets in what had to be record time. Fucking hell, she could really put down nuggets. It was incredible she had the lithe figure that she did.\n\n\"Anon.\"\n\n\"What's up?\" I asked, snapping out of my gawking over her \n\n\"You got your stuff packed, right?\"\n\nI think for a moment, realizing that the entire time we were preparing for our road trip, I had done absolutely zero packing. \"Shhhhhhhhhhhit...\"\n\n\"Way to go, dweeb. I got all my stuff packed since like, 2 days ago. How are you so bad at managing your time?\"\n\n\"I guess I...\"\n\nShit, why didn't I prepare sooner? I had all the time in the world to just pack a suitcase or two. Am I really that autistic that I can't even pack to go on a trip with my girlfriend? Fucking hell, Anon. You really need to get your shit together before your actual life starts. Otherwise college is just gonna be like high school, except you won't have the love of your life with you. College is gonna be a drag without Fang, but that's not something I wanna worry about just yet. I'd have to talk with her about that during Christmas or something. Then again, thinking about my feelings for her, especially as of late, I realized I was really enjoying my time with her, even though most of it was spent performing back breaking labor and almost baking alive in a camper. It was still time well spent, especially when I got to see her so full of joy.\n\n\"I guess I was just having so much fun with you that I kinda forgot to get ready.\"\n\nMy words managed to get a slight bit of blush across the ptero's face, a light-hearted scowl lighting up her visage as if I just embarrassed her in public.\n\n\"You get off to this, don't you?\"\n\n\"And what if I do?\"\n\n\"Then you're a perv that deserves to get his ass beat.\" Fang downed the last of those nuggets, her blackhole of a gullet just now being satisfied. \"You need help packing your bags? We've got until tomorrow. I wanna leave before noon.\"\n\n\"Nah, I shouldn't need an-\"\n\n\"So that settles it. I'm coming with you so I can help you pack.\"\n\n\"But-\"\n\n\"Shut up. We're leaving.\"\n\nFang took me by the wrist and lead me out the door, practically dragging me back to my shitty apartment on skin row much to my own chagrin. Not gonna lie, it was kinda embarrassing having Fang dig through my closet and tear apart my place to help me look for clothes to bring and other various shit to pack. It was a constant battle of either digging through mountains of laundry and fighting with the ptero when she started digging a bit too deep to keep her from finding the weird stuff I kept tucked away, like the scrap book my mom gave me of some of the most embarrassing moments of my childhood, or Saturnia. She can NOT find those, even if it means-\n\n\"Awwwh, is this a scrapbook your mom made you?\" Fang said, nearly gushing like she did when we had our date at the aquarium.\n\n\"NONONONONONONPUTITDOWNPUTITDOWNPUTITDOWNGIMMETHATRIGHTFUCKINGNOW!\" Sprinting across the room, I snatched the book out of her hands. Thankfully, she had only gotten to the first page, and didn't see those other embarrassing moments in my life, like the costumes I wore for Halloween.\n\n\"Awh, come on. Why won't you show me your scrapbook? My mom showed you mine!\"\n\n\"Listen, there's a part of me I don't want you seeing yet. One day, I'll show you. But not today.\" I tucked the scrapbook under my mattress.\n\nFang pouted, eventually turning back to stuffing some of my clothes and various odds and ends in a mixture of a duffle bag, backpack, and a suitcase. Before we knew it, after lots of slacking off to watch a movie or two, the day was winding down, the sunlight gradually waning and giving a berth for the evening. As bad as I felt having my girlfriend help me pack my bags due to my own ineptitude, it was still kinda fun since it was just more time spent with her before our lives would inevitably lead us to go our separate ways. The night was made even better when Fang stayed the night with me, doing our usual schtick of watching movies, playing games, and eventually falling asleep.\n\n\n...\n\n\nFang and I were both jolted awake by her phone erupting in some kind of esoteric indie shit of a ringtone. Groggily, she fished it out of her pocket and set it on speaker.\n\n\"What's up?\" She asked with a yawn as I looked at her phone, seeing a picture of Reed as an icon.\n\n\"Faaaaang, mi amigaaaa. We still good to go today?\"\n\nFang instantly perked up, snapping out of her groggy state and sitting up, her tail thumping a beat into my bed. \"Uh, duh! I just finished helping Anon pack his bags last night!\"\n\n\"Suuuup.\" I called, sitting up behind Fang, my lap covered by my bedsheets as I rubbed my face.\n\n\"Sick! I'll swing by your place with Trish here in an hour or so. I'll see ya then, dudes!\"\n\nThe call ended and Fang looked at me over her shoulder, rubbing the top of my skull. \"Ready to go? I'll call us a cab.\"\n\nGetting things rounded up, we did a final check to make sure I had everything, even grabbing a few drinks and snacks for the road to add to our already large stockpile of grub. Just as we sat on a bench just outside Skin Row, a familiar taxi pulled up in front of us, with a VERY familiar raptor in the driver seat.\n\n\"Ayhayhaaaaay, if it ain't my favorite lovebirds, how ya been, skinnie?\"\n\nSeriously, how is it always this guy? Whatever, I don't really mind him. Turns out, he's been pretty chill after our first ride when I lost a fight with the stairs.\n\n\"Pretty good. We're heading out for a road trip today.\" I responded, throwing my bags into the trunk before joining Fang in the backseat, the driver peeling out and speeding off before I could even buckle my seatbelt.\n\n\"Niiice, where you two planning on going?\"\n\n\"Not sure.\" Fang interjected. \"We're just doing things in the spur of the moment. Seeing where the road takes us, ya know?\"\n\n\"I getcha. I remember doing the same thing after I graduated high school. Got into HEAPS of trouble, heheh. But it was worth it in the end. Couple times friends and I nearly got mixed up with a bunch of goons in a bar once! I still got the stitches from where one of them bastards shanked me! Wanna see?\" The raptor asked, beginning to lift up his shirt, nearly running over an old couple in the process.\n\n\"M-maybe next time! Just get us to her place!\"\n\nHe lowered his shirt. \"Alright, alright, no need to get ya panties in a bunch.\" He said, giving a little chuckle to himself before pulling up to Fang's house where our friends were already waiting.\n\n\"Thanks for the lift.\" I said, tossing a couple bills and a bit extra into one of the cupholders.\n\n\"Any time, skinnie. Stay safe out there. Ya know how to get a hold of me.\"\n\nThe moment I closed the trunk, that sketchy raptor sped off, leaving me to lug the bags towards the van as Fang greeted the gang with hugs abound while they shared all the locations they wanted to visit. Checking my phone, it was 11:30, which gave me plenty of time to load up my bags and join my friends, the tension in the air not being present when I noticed I wasn't under the sentry-like gaze of the patriarch of the family. Just as I closed the trunk of the hippy van, Fang called out to me.\n\n\"Anon, can you grab my sunglasses? I left them in my room!\"\n\n\"Gotcha!\"\n\nHeading through the front door, I waved at the small matriarch as she messed around in the kitchen.\n\n\"Oh Anon, please stay safe! Look out for our sweet Lucy, okay?\" She chimed, giving a wave back at me. Something about her voice seemed off. That usual sweet and bright intonation of her voice sounding noticeably melancholic. Poor thing, she was clearly going to miss her daughter. Though her voice was a tad choked up, it seemed that seeing me only reaffirmed her that she would be looked after.\n\n\"I'll make sure she stays safe, ma'am.\" I reassured, giving her my best comforting smile, which seemed to noticeably put her at ease.\n\nHeading up to Fang's room, I spotted her pair of aviators on her dresser and snatched them up, heading right back out into the hall. As I touched the hand railing of the stairs, I noticed a door off to my right was open about halfway, something I didn't spot before. Curiosity getting the best of me, I poked my head through the doorway, seeing a hulking figure sitting on a made bed. I only knew one person with a body as wide as a semi-truck. It was Fang's Dad, and from what I could tell, his body sagged, his head looking down at the ground in what was likely deep contemplation. Considering what had happened only a couple days before, it was safe to say Fang's final words to him had cut him deeper than any blade possibly could.\n\n\"Anon. I need to have a word with you.\"\n\nShit, how did he know I was there?\n\nDid he hear my footsteps? What was normally a voice that would cause me to soil my trousers from a mile away bore the unmistakable tone of depression. It sounded worse than I could've imagined. I had never seen someone as stoic as him be reduced to a shell of a man.\n\n\"Is uh... everything alright, sir?\" I asked, stepping into the room, my hand resting on the door handle.\n\n\"Anon, do you really love Lucy?\"\n\nI gave a confused look. Where was he going with this? Was he suddenly warming up to me? \"I do. I've never cared for anyone before. She was the first person I ever came to care for on an intimate level.\"\n\nFang's dad stood up, and trudged towards me, a pen and slip of paper in his hands, which he began to write on.\n\"Frankly Anon, I don't particularly like you. You know this well enough. But I still care for my daughter more than you could even begin to comprehend.\" He handed me the paper. \"So I'm putting my trust in you.\" Taking the slip of paper, I looked down at the line of digits, which I would instantly realize was a phone number. \"This is my personal cellphone number. If anything happens to Naser or Lucy, and ESPECIALLY Lucy, call me. I WILL pick up.\"\n\nThe father patted my shoulder. The usual heavy hand that threatened to crumple me feeling noticeably lighter.\n\n\"You have my word, sir.\"\n\n\"Call me Ridley.\"\n\n\"Sure thing, uh... Ridley.\"\n\nAs I turned away, Ridley's grip on my shoulder tightened, freezing me in place.\n\n\"Keep her safe, Anon.\"\n\nThere was a deafening silence as my brain bore the brunt of his words, his voice gravely with a bassy rumble.\n\n\"You can count on me.\"\n\nOnce Ridley relinquished my shoulder, I stepped back through the doorway, dragging the door behind me. Just as the metal latch of the door hit the frame, I suddenly remembered something. Now that I had a bit of a heart-to-heart moment with Ridley, it was the perfect opportunity to ask him a question I had nagging at the back of my mind. I wheeled back around and pushed open the door just in time to catch Ridley before he sat back down.\n\n\"Hey, Ridley... Why do you not like humans?\"\n\nThe question stopped him in his tracks as he gave me a look over his shoulder, his gaze telling me it wasn't a topic he was looking forward to discussing.\n\n\"I haven't had the best experience around your kind for many years. I'll leave it at that. When you kids return, we'll sit down and I'll tell you more. Until then, you kids have your fun.\"\n\nThat wasn't really the answer I was hoping for, but at the very least, he opened up to me ever so slightly. Closing the door behind me I ran down stairs, Fang's mother sweeping me up in a feathery hug and giving a kiss to my cheek.\n\n\"Ooooh I'm gonna miss my sweet little Tooth Fairy! Take care of her, Anon. I know she can be a handful.\"\n\nGod, it was so weird seeing the personality difference between the two of them. I felt so safe around Fang's mom.\n\n\"I promise I'll keep her safe, ma'am.\" I said, beaming a smile at her and returning the hug.\n\n\"Oh sweetie, call me Samantha. No need to be so formal with me. Now go! Shoo!\" She responded, shoving me towards the door, the gang's heads all turning towards me as they took the signal and began piling in the hippy van.\n\n\"Let's go, Anon!\" Shouted Naser, pulling open the driver-side door. \"I got the whip.\"\n\nI walked over and snatched the keys out of Naser's hand. \"No way, retard. I'm driving.\"\n\nNaser recoiled in shock. \"Wh- do you even have a license!?\"\n\nI ignored his question and hopped into the driver seat, slamming the door shut as Fang hopped in the passenger seat, leaving Naser to have to climb over a couple laps to sit next to Naomi. Giving Fang her shades, she immediately put them on, the smoky lenses concealing all but the most minute traces of her eyes.\n\n\"You ready for the road trip of a lifetime?\" She asked, taking my right hand to give it a squeeze, along with gifting me a that bright and beautiful smile I came to love.\n\nMy head turned to hers, my own grin decorating my face, before I turned to see Samantha waving us off. Giving her a wave goodbye, my attention was turned towards one of the windows on the second floor, where Ridley was standing, watching. And he was looking directly at me. The look in his eyes were as clear as day. Without a spoken word, I knew what he was saying.\n\n\"Bring her home safe.\"\n\nI turned the keys in the ignition and put the gear shift in drive.\n\n\"Let's get this show on the road.\""},"The True Game.txt":{"path":["Fang","The True Game.txt"],"text":"Title: The True Game\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Reed and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n> Goodbye volcano high is finally released\n> Start game\n> Black screen cue to narration\n> Blah blah blah my band is important blah blah blah nobody understands me blah blah blah I feel depressed\n> Black screen transitions to a front shot of Fang\n> \"My name is fang and this is my story\"\n> Vinyl scratch sound\n\"Woah woah woah!

Do you like what you see?\" Lucy asked me tentatively\n\nThe woman of my dreams was standing in the doorframe of the bathroom, too embarrassed to strip in front of me. She was still too embarrassed to strip at all, instead wearing a plain white nightgown. She might as well have, the ultra-thin fabric did nothing to hide her sinful body. modest breasts were bulging the loose silk, protruding nipples clearly betraying her arousal. The swell of her hips was just large enough to force the garment to hug them. The gown itself could barely be called such, it stopped halfway down her thighs teasing the pale skin beneath. Lucy rubbed her shoulder nervously, oh right, I was supposed to be answering a question instead of ogling her.\n\n\"Lucy, that's a silly question to ask.\" I smiled, patting the bed beside me.\n\nShe took only a moment to steel her nerves before she made her way over to me one hesitant step at a time. Eventually taking a seat next to me, she still couldn't find it in her to look right at me. The poor girl was blushing up a storm, her normally pale cheeks were flushed a bright crimson that practically spilled across her snout. Yet despite how unsure she acted there was no denying the nervous smile she wore. I reached over and cupped her cheek, my lips meeting the other one.\n\n\"Because you're the most beautiful woman in Volcadera Bluff.\" I whispered in her ear\n\nThat proved too much for her, she was forced to hide her face in her hands but even between her fingers I could see that blush only intensified. I couldn't help but chuckle at her, how is it even possible for someone to act this cute? With her face covered by her hands, my usual avenue for attack was blocked off. My lips traveled from her jaw down the smooth skin of her neck until they landed at the tender flesh where her neck met her shoulder. Lucy gasped as I teased her with my teeth, merely hinting at the possibility of a bite. I could feel her hand grasp the back of my head, urging me to continue. I had a better idea however and scooped her up in my arms.\n\nOur eyes met for a brief moment, her cheeks were no less crimson than they were before but the bite of her lip begged me to continue. I planted a chaste kiss on the tip of her snout, causing her to giggle before I dropped her back on the bed. Lucy propped herself up on her elbows, an eager smile on her lips. she splayed her legs, inviting me between them. Before I could take her offer I noticed something that caught my breath. Despite the dim light of the room, through the shadow her gown cast, I could see the pale skin of her thigh traveled all the way up. No panties.\n\n\"Should we really be doing this before marriage?\" Lucy asked one last doubt on her mind.\n\n\"I won't tell if you won't. The wedding's in a month isn't it?\" I answered her with a grin, discarding the last of my clothes and crawling between her legs.\n\nLucy smiled nervously, her eyes firmly locked on the member tenting the gown between her legs. Her eyes held equal parts anticipation and hesitation but when I rubbed against her moist slit, Lucy's true desire was clear. I slowly pulled her gown up her body until it was scrunched up around her stomach, baring her lower half to the world. My hand across the smooth skin of her thighs as they returned. I could feel myself throb, painfully as I stared at Lucy, my Lucy, fully exposed and ready for me. I leaned over her, our lips met and we finally joined our bodies as our souls did long ago. She moaned into my lips when I entered her, her talons scrabbling across my chest and shoulders. The pain of it making me growl, that was going to leave marks for sure. Our next kiss was ferocious as I pinned her arms to either side of her head, our fingers intertwining. I broke away from just a moment, my eyes traveling down her form to take in my prize.\n\nLucy's face had remained flush, despite the fact that we had barely begun her chest was already heaving. Her wings were splayed out to either side of the bed, the tips of them sporadically twitching in arousal. The gown did nothing to hide the perfect curves of her body now, I twitched inside her when I saw where we were connected. A primal part of my brain whispered in my ear that I was so close to her womb, that I was an inch away from claiming this woman as my own. My eyes trailed back up her body until my gaze met Lucy's once again. Her half-lidded eyes were utterly lost to lust, she was silently begging for the same very same thing, lost in her own animal desire to be bred. There was no point holding back then was there? Unable to resist myself anymore I smashed my hips against hers.\n\nThe two of us moaned, the sensation of being fully joined was far too much. The electric pleasure racing up my spine paused me briefly before I pulled my hips back, eager to continue. The first few thrusts were experimental, our bodies still learning each other but our passion was a quick teacher. With confident, powerful thrusts I crashed our hips together, the force of it sending Lucy's modest breasts bouncing in her gown. My wife to be looked more beautiful than ever with her eyes rolled halfway into her skull, lengthy tongue no longer contained within her snout. Despite how lost to pleasure she seemed, Lucy still managed to meet my hips with her own. Her body begging me to go deeper, harder, faster. I could feel myself nearing my limit and I forced myself to slow down, to savor the moment. Lucy seemed to recover now that our lovemaking was no longer so wild.\n\n\"Anon...\" She moaned, her eyes now locked to where our bodies met.\n\n\"Hm?\" I mumbled, trying to catch my breath.\n\n\"Would it... Could I... Be on top?\" She asked, somehow managing to sound bashful asking that while I was still inside her.\n\n\"Yeah, of course.\" I nodded, rolling off her. \n\nThe room was shockingly cold, at least compared to the sweltering furnace that was Lucy's insides. I lay on my back, watching Lucy's wings tremble slightly as she sat up straight. She was staring at my member, standing proudly and still coated with her juices. Something about the intensity in that stare spurred something within me, forcing me to thrust weakly at the air.\n\n\"A-any time, Lucy,\" I begged, so close to release.\n\nI expected her to be embarrassed or to apologize, instead, Lucy straddled my hips and grasped by length before seating herself proudly upon it. The return to her warmth forced me to gasp, the shock of pleasure was nearly enough to make me cum then and there. Lucy rolled her hips experimentally, getting used to the new position. I groaned as her slick walls rubbed against me, god I wouldn't last much longer at this rate. She quickly found an angle to her liking and the room was soon filled with the lewd, wet, sounds of our hips clapping together. I bit my lip and looked away, desperate to hold on just a little longer. Lucy only quickened her pace, the most beautiful girl in the world was bouncing in my lap and I couldn't enjoy the sight! \n\n\"Oh Anon!\" Lucy moaned, her talons dug into my shoulder again. The pain making me gasp.\n\n\"Anon...\" Her voice had turned low, husky.\n\nI couldn't respond, every bit of focus I could spare was lost on the pain as her nails dug into me. Lucy didn't seem to care that I didn't say anything, she continued moaning my name as her hips impossibly picked up speed. This was it, I couldn't hold out any longer, no man could. Just as I was about to give myself into the sweet release when something sharp and wet grasped me by the throat! It tightened almost painfully around the sensitive flesh and a switch within me flicked, whether it was beaten into me by the military or some animal instinct I flung the assailant off me. I somehow only briefly registered that it had to be Lucy to have bitten my neck but my body cared little as I forced her down, my hands grasped firmly around her own neck, forcing her back against the bed. I slowly regained my senses once her jaws were removed from my neck, my grip loosened almost imperceptibly when I was forced to moan. Fang's lower muscles were milking my cock while my hands were around her neck, was she cumming!? Both the thought and the sensations proved far too much for me, as close to the edge as I already was. My grip tightened around her neck unbidden as my hips thrust against her, desperate to spill my seed as far inside her as possible. \n\nThe high of my orgasm didn't last long, with the clarity gained my hands dropped away from her neck and I sat back, breathing heavily. I glanced down at my lover, her hair was an absolute mess and slick with sweat. Her white gown was nearly translucent and stuck to her breasts, doing little to hide them. I winced as I saw the red marks around her neck as well as the heaving of her chest as she fought to get the air that was denied her. Her legs were twitching with the aftermath of her own orgasm, her wings flapped weakly beneath her with unspent energy. Despite that, Lucy's expression was undoubtedly one of a very satisfied ptero. \n\n\"That was...\" I couldn't finish the sentence, breathing heavily as I was.\n\n\"Amazing.\" Lucy finished for me, sounding no less exhausted.\n\nThe two of us spent a minute catching our breath, our worlds slowly returning to normal.\n\n\"Oh! Oh my goodness, dear! You're bleeding!\" Lucy gasped, concern clear in her voice.\n\nMy hand reached for my collar bone and returned wet with my own blood, I hadn't even noticed. It couldn't have been that bad right? Lucy certainly thought otherwise, leaping off the bed to grab the first aid kit in the bathroom.

It would probably sell for about a dollar in some dinky gift-shop somewhere.\n> I pocket it on a whim, barely giving it any thought as I walk inside\n> As usual, Fang is waiting for me by my locker, tapping an improvised tune against the metal\n> \"Morning dork.\" She yawns, snapping her jaws.\n> \"Sup Fang.\" I reply, reaching into my pocket, \"Hey check out what I just found.\"\n> I toss the agate to Fang, who easily catches it. She turns it over in the light, wiping off the dirt with her thumb\n> \"Nice find dweeb, you thinking of becoming a geologist?\"\n> \"Yeah yeah, whatever.\" I scoff, grabbing my bag from my locker, \"I just found it outside on the lawn. You want it?\"\n> Fang gasps, fumbling and nearly dropping the rock. She stares at me wide eyed, a crimson blush spreading over her face\n> \"Fang? You alright?\" I ask, confused. Is something wrong with her? Does she have a fever?\n> \"Y-yeah! I'm fine!\" Fang nearly shouts, smiling nervously. \"Are you really sure you want me to have it?\"\n> \"Sure, why not?\" I shrug, slinging my bag over my shoulder. \"I can keep it if you don't want it.\"\n> \"No!\" Fang snaps, clasping the stone tightly to her chest as if it's the most precious thing in the world. \"I mean, uh... sure. I'll take it off you hands, it's fine.\"\n> \"Oookay then...\" I reply suspiciously. I don't know what's going on with Fang today, she's definitely acting weird.\n> \"Anyway, I'll see you later at science class.\" I wave as I head off, the first bell of the day ringing overhead. Fang meekly waves back, retreating beneath her wings as they fold over her head\n> From a distance, I can just barely hear a muffled \"EEEEEE!!!\" from beneath her feathers as I turn around the corner.\n> Huh, wonder what all that was about. Maybe I can ask Reed about it later, see if she got sick over the weekend or something. Oh well, I'm sure it's nothing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> It's finally the end of the week, and everyone is eager to finally go home for the weekend.\n> Stepping down the school's concrete steps, I fish out my phone and get check my favorite Indonesian pickle shearing forum. As usual, there's nothing interesting going on.\n> My feet are on autopilot as I walk down the sidewalk, and I nearly stumble into someone standing in my way\n> It's a pterosaur who's name I can't quite recall. I recognize her from some of my classes however. We've never really talked.\n> She's shorter than Fang, but not quite so thin. Much more colorful though. She always seemed particularly shy, and honestly she's pretty cute.\n> \"Uh, h-hey Anon.\" she stammers, running her hand through her hair, \"I was wondering, um-\"\n> Oh great, what is this going to be? Some stupid question about humans? Somebody trying to get answers about Fang?\n> She mentally psyches herself up, slapping her cheeks and straightening her back\n> Reaching into her bag, she quickly pulls something out and thrusts it to me.\n> It's a stick. Admittedly, a pretty nice stick, but still a stick.\n> She clearly want me to have it, so I reluctantly take it.\n> Is this some stupid caveman thing? Is this racist? Was she put up to this?\n> Suddenly, she starts strutting back and forth in front of me, puffing out her chest while bobbing her head forward and back\n> ...What?\n> Dude, what the fuck am I looking at?\n> Everyone on the front lawn is staring, or excitedly whispering to each other as she continues the display.\n> The mystery pterosaur stops strutting and starts scraping her feet against the ground, fluffing and flapping her wings wildly\n> I have no idea what the fuck is happening\n> Is this some kind of prank?\n> Am I getting punked?\n> Does Volcano High have an interpretive dance troupe?\n> This is all so totally fucking bizarre I can't even think. I just stand there slack-jawed, stick in hand\n> Suddenly Fang storms up from behind me, roughly shoving me behind her and slapping the stick out of my hand\n> She looks absolutely livid. Her feathers are all standing on end, her wings fully extended as she bares her teeth at the other dino\n> Fang takes a deep breath, her chest visibly filling with air\n> \"**SKREE-ONK!!**\"\n> What the fuck\n> This day is just too fucking weird for me. I just want to go home.\n> The shorter pterosaur looks absolutely terrified, visibly quailing under Fang's murderous glare\n> Stammering out a rapid apology, she literally sprints off across the lawn and out of sight\n> Fang calms down slightly, but she's still clearly agitated, her wings refusing to come down to rest completely\n> Without a word she possessively wraps her arm around mine, pulling me to her side\n> Holding her head up high but refusing to look at me, Fang nearly drags me down the sidewalk past the crowd of whispering students\n> I'm too fucking baffled to object, my fried brain content to just be lead wherever Fang intends to go\n> Finally, about a block away, I remember how words work\n> \"Fang, what the fuck was that?\" I ask, trying and failing to escape form Fang's iron grip\n> \"Nothing dork, don't worry about it.\" Fang replies, pulling me in tighter. She still won't look at me, although I can faintly hear Fang mumbling.\n> \"Fucking skank, thinks she can't just walk up and-...\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> It's another typical lunch break at Volcano High, sitting with the Fang Gang at our usual spot\n> Trish, Reed, and Fang are all excitedly talking about their next upcoming show, debating lightning and the possibility of pyrotechnics\n> I don't have much to contribute, and today I'm lost in thought. Something has been bugging me for a while now, and I can't get my mind off it\n> I absentmindedly push my food around, trying to think things through and tuning out the world around me\n> \"Hey, Earth to Anon? You in there?\" Fang asks, elbowing my side, \"You okay dude? You've been mumbling nonstop.\"\n> \"Yeah, I'm good. Just got something on my mind.\" I answer, \"It's probably nothing.\"\n> \"What's up dude? You can tell us.\" Reed chimes in, Trish clearly annoyed at the interruption\n> \"Well, it's kind of weird...\" I scratch the back of my head, knowing how strange this will all sound, \"I think there's a stray cat or something in my apartment building.\"\n> Everyone is just staring, waiting for me to continue. With a sigh, I decide to just lay it all out.\n> \"It started a couple weeks ago.\" I explain, \"I got up and found a big stick on my front mat. I didn't think anything of it, but every couple days another shows up.\"\n> \"You found... a stick.\" Trish deadpans, her eyes narrowing dangerously\n> \"Yeah, and not just sticks.\" I continue, \"Sometimes it's big colored rocks, or blankets, a couple pillows, old bed stuffing, all kinds of stuff.\"\n> \"Dude, a cat couldn't do that.\" Reed counters, \"Unless it was like, a big cougar or something.\"\n> \"I think I would have noticed that.\" I reply, \"But what else could it be? It's too strange to be a prank or a threat.\"\n> \"I don't know man, I'm stumped.\" Reed admits, leaning back into his seat, \"You have any ideas Trish?\"\n> \"Nope.\" Trish spits out through clenched teeth, her claws scraping against the table, \"What about you Fang?\"\n> \"Huh? N-no\" Fang stammers, apparently more interested in something stuck on the ceiling, \"I've got no idea what's going on.\"\n> \"Well, whatever.\" I shrug, focusing back on my cold lunch, \"I guess it's not really a problem. It'll probably stop eventually.\"\n> The four of us eat in relative silence, content with just each other's company. Fang though seems distracted now, barely picking at her food.\n> \"So...\" she hesitantly begins, trying to sound casual, \"What did you end up doing with that stuff anyway?\"\n> \"I just tossed most of it.\" I answer honestly, Fang's wings and shoulders visibly drooping. A brief flash of sadness on her face is quickly covered up by a fake smile\n> \"Although...\" I continue after another bite of food, \"I did end up keeping most of the pillows and blankets.\"\n> \"Really?\" Fang asks hopefully, her mood completely turning around in an instant\n> \"Yeah, my old bed was a piece of shit.\" I explain, \"Now it's probably the comfiest place on Skin Row.\"\n> \"Oh, good!\" Fang smiles, her tail thumping happily against her seat. I'm not sure why she's so concerned about my sleeping arrangements, but it's nice to see her so happy\n> Still no idea where all that stuff came from though, it's quite the mystery.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> It's late in the evening as I come home from work, several heavy bags of groceries in my arms\n> I struggle with the paper bags as I fumble with the front door to my new home, a little two bedroom townhouse I moved into with Fang last year\n> It feels like we still moving in even after all these months, but I'm starting to recognize it as home, not just some stranger's house I'm sleeping in\n> \"Hey Fang, I'm home!\" I call out at I kick the door closed behind me. There's no answer, which isn't that unusual. Fang probably just has her headphones on or something.\n> As I walk into the living room though, I notice something is wrong. The couch is pushed askew, all the cushions and pillows missing\n> At first I fear we've been robbed, my thoughts immediately jumping to Fang's safety, but then I notice the TV is still here.\n> No, nothing valuable is missing, just all the couch cushions and blankets. Oh, now I know what's going on. It finally happened.\n> I head into the kitchen, dropping the heavy paper bags onto the counter. It's amazing how much food two people can go through, especially in these last couple months\n> The food can get put away later, I need to find Fang. I head down the hallway and into the bedroom, fairly sure I know where to find her\n> Just as I suspected, the bedroom is in a similar state as the living room. The mattress has been flipped over, stripped off all it's sheets and pillows.\n> I don't have to look in the bathroom to know all the towels have been ransacked as well\n> I head to the walk-in closet, slowly pushing the creaky door open\n> \"Hey Fang, you in here?\" I gently call out, flipping on the light\n> In the center of the closet is a massive pile of pillows, blankets, towels, and every other soft item collected from the entire house.\n> Looks like some of my shirts are in there as well, along with my old jacket\n> Something shifts deep within the pile, the tiny tip of Fang's tail poking out the backside\n> \"Mhmm...\" Fang replies, unwilling to climb out. It's not hard to imagine the mortified blush on her face\n> I bite my lip, fighting down laughter. She has to be embarrassed enough already, it would be too much to start teasing her\n> \"Do you want to come out?\" I ask, trying to keep my voice from cracking. Fang's only response is top burrow deeper into the pile, her tail slipping back inside\n> I stand up to leave, partly so I don't burst out laughing. We both knew this would happen eventually, honestly I'm surprised she restrained herself for so long\n> Heading back into the kitchen, I start rummaging through the groceries. I grab one of the bags of dino-nuggets, storing the other five in the freezer.\n> I toss about a dozen nuggets on a plate and set them in the microwave, putting away the rest of the groceries while they cook\n> Once the nuggets are cooked just the way I know Fang likes them, I carry the plate back into the bedroom closet\n> She must have been able to smell them from across the house. The tip of her snout is pushed out from under the blankets as she audibly sniffs the air\n> \"Hey Fang.\" I coo, once again trying desperately to not laugh, \"You want some food?\"\n> She hesitates, no doubt weighing the indignity of being fed against her instinctive desire for food. Finally she relents, wordlessly opening her snout\n> I gingerly move a nugget to her between my fingers, Fang snapping it up like a crocodile once it's within reach.\n> She chews it ravenously, swallowing it down and immediately awaiting more. I grab another, careful to keep my fingers away form those sharp teeth\n> As I feed her, I can't help but pull out my phone and start recording this. This is just too good, it's like feeding a shy raccoon. I definitely need to send Trish the video later.\n> Fang will no doubt get her revenge on me later for this, but it'll be worth it.\n> Once I run out of nuggets and Fang realizes there no more, she retreats back into her nest. I stand up and wipe the crumbs off my fingers, switching off the light as I leave\n> I head downstairs and into the laundry room, which predictably has been instinctively pillaged along with the rest of the house\n> Luckily, I've prepared for this day. The doctor we've been seeing warned me this would happen while Fang was out of earshot\n> Sliding one of the ceiling panels away, I grab the duffel back I had stashed away about a month ago. Inside is a sleeping bag, and a couple sets of clothes\n> It won't be comfy, but it'll be better than sleeping on the bare floor. Should be enough to get me through the final month or so until the delivery.","Title":"Weird Customs","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"}},"Multiple":{"A Better End Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Multiple","A Better End Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: A Better End\nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Fang, Naser, Trish, Tana, Reed, Chadley, Stella, Rosa, Joshua and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: Rangto\nSummary: Four years after his service in the Navy, Anon returns to the town where he experienced some of the best and worst times of his high school life.

Another shitty gig.\n\n   Fang briefly wonders what day it is, but she puts the question out of her mind as she finishes the last notes of yet another tired old song. She doesn\u2019t even bother looking up anymore. She knows that there are no crowds cheering her on or even giving her the time of day. At most, someone will give her a passing glance before returning to whatever it was they were doing. At worst, they\u2019ll just ignore her like they have for the last three years. The monochromatic ptero briefly wonders what it\u2019s like to have aspirations in life; to have actual hopes or dreams to chase down and achieve\u2026\n\n   Fang shuts her eyes and bitterly chides herself. Dreams are only for those that can afford to chase them, not for someone whose only thing left in life is a job. The ptero can\u2019t help but grip the end of her bass as she thinks about her situation. \u2018Play my shitty gig, get my shitty pay, give most of my shitty pay to the collectors, use what remains of that shitty pay on food, rent, and whatever shitty comforts I can get my hands on\u2026 and then do it all over again the next day, and the next, and the next until I finally  Dreams are only for those that can afford to chase them, not for someone whose only thing left in life is a job...\u2019\n\n   God, she hates her life so much, but it\u2019s not like she has a choice in the matter. Whatever \u2018bright\u2019 future she may have once had, she tossed that away the day she stormed out of her friends and family\u2019s lives. She even went out of her way to buy a \u2018fresh start,\u2019 something that she now admittedly regrets. The last four years of her life had been nothing short of hell because of that hasty, stupid decision. It was probably the second biggest mistake of her life, the first being\u2026\n\n   \u2018No,\u2019 Fang thinks as she represses the memory of a certain bald human back into the recesses of her mind. \u2018That bastard\u2019s not worth remembering anymore\u2026\u2019\n\n   \u201cHey, Gilda! You awake?\u201d a light magenta-toned triceratops asks she turns to face her bandmate. \u201cYou\u2019ve been spacing out since we finished that last song!\u201d\n\n   Fang snaps out of her rut and turns to look her bandmate in the eye. For just a second, the ptero swears that she\u2019s looking into the face of her old friend, another triceratops named Trish. The sense of familiarity has to do mostly with the almost identical facial structure, short curly tuft of hair, and purple eyes. Of course, that feeling of familiarity soon passes when her bandmate\u2019s other differences become apparent. \n\n   For one thing, Fang\u2019s bandmate is a light magenta in tone, and not purple like Trish was. She is also somehow shorter than Trish ever was, standing almost a head and a half shorter than the ptero. Finally, unlike Trish\u2019s trademark yellow hoodie, black jogging pants, and red boxing boots, her bandmate instead sports a fairly typical white tank top, a knee-long black skirt, and a pair of fairly beat-up converse shoes.\n\n   With an exasperated sigh, Fang reaches for an almost empty bottle of water and takes a sip. The moment she\u2019s done, she fixes her bandmate with a glossy, tired glare. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing this shitty gig for almost two hours now, Tana. \u2018Course I\u2019m going to space out.\u201d\n\n   The magenta triceratops rolls her eyes and crosses her arms. \u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who was all excited about playing this gig?\u201d\n\n   Fang fixes her bandmate with another tired glossy glare. Tana only shakes her head and turns to face the third member of the band, a reasonably bulky shark in a blue muscle shirt and white shorts sitting behind a set of drums. \u201cWhat about you, Chadley? You also feeling spaced out tonight?\u201d\n\n   The shark gives his bandmate a wide toothy grin as he plays a quick beat on his drums. \u201cGetting a bit tired, but my head\u2019s still in the game!\u201d\n\n   Tana nods and turns back to Fang. \u201cWell, there you go, Gilda. Looks like you\u2019re the only one whose head isn\u2019t in the game.\u201d\n\n   Fang rolls her eyes and steps forward. \u201cLet\u2019s just end our set and go home,\u201d she says in a bitter tone.\n\n   \u201cWhat song you wanna close the night on?\u201d Tana asks as she checks her guitar\u2019s strings for the correct tension.\n\n   Fang ponders on just what song to end the night with. She could pick any one piece that she wanted. Not that it matters much to her in the end. People will ignore it as usual, so it was almost a pointless decision. Still, something in her heart pushes her to play a specific song, one that she had written not that long ago during a particularly harrowing and lonely night. One that she knew her bandmates detested for its downright bleak lyrics\u2026\n\n   \u201cLet\u2019s end it with \u2018Not Here,\u2019\u201d Fang says with a weary grin on her lips.\n\n   Tana lets out a groan and shakes her head. \u201cReally?\u201d she asks, her brow furrowed in response. \u201cThat song\u2019s SO nihilistic!\u201d\n\n   \u201cGotta agree with Tana on this one,\u201d Chadley chimes in, all the while running a hand through his short black hair. \u201cLike, I know you wrote it and stuff, but does it have to be so bleak?\u201d\n\n   \u201cNot like anyone\u2019s even listening,\u201d Fang points to the virtually deserted pizzeria. \u201cBesides,\u201d the ptero continues, an uncharacteristic fire burning in her eyes. \u201cI want to feel something other than apathy tonight.\u201d\n\n   Tana shakes her head and readies her guitar. \u201cOkay, fine. But for the next gig, I\u2019m choosing what our last song is. Got it?\u201d\n\n   Fang doesn\u2019t even bother acknowledging her bandmate as she begins strumming her bass. Seconds later, she\u2019s joined by Tana and Chadley, the duo jumping in to fill a melancholic, almost depressing tune whose main instrumental sound comes from Fang\u2019s bass.\n\n   The intro melody lasts about ten seconds before Fang steps forward and takes her place in front of the microphone. With a deep breath, she closes her eyes and recites the song\u2019s lyrics.\n\n   Lyrics that arise from the very depths of her soul:\n\n \n\n   I am a question to the world,\n\n   Not an answer to be heard\n\n   Or a moment that's held in your arms.\n\n   And what do you think you'd ever say?\n\n   I won't listen anyway\u2026\n\n   You don't know me,\n\n   And I\u2019ll never be what you want me to be.\n\n \n\n   The song picks up in tempo, though the melody remains as bleak as ever.\n\n \n\n   And what do you think you'd understand?\n\n   I\u2019m neither boy or a woman\n\n   You can take me and toss me away\n\n   And how can you learn what's never shown?\n\n   Yeah, you stand here on your own.\n\n   They don't know me 'cause I'm not here.\n\n \n\n   Chadley beats on his drums as Tana begins strumming her guitar energetically. It almost starts to overpower Fang\u2019s bass. Ultimately, though, the depressing nature of the ptero\u2019s bass strumming wins out in the end, resulting in a tone that\u2019s as unmelodious as it is downright depressing.\n\n \n\n   And I want a moment to be real,\n\n   Wanna touch things I don't feel,\n\n   Wanna hold on and feel I belong.\n\n   And how can the world want me to change?\n\n   They\u2019re the ones that stay the same.\n\n   They don\u2019t know me,\n\n   'Cause I\u2019m not here.\n\n \n\n   The song again slows as Fang\u2019s bass takes point once again, much to Tana\u2019s visible chagrin.\n\n \n\n   And you see the things they never see\n\n   All you wanted, I can\u2019t be\n\n   Now you know me, are you afraid?\n\n   And I wanna tell you who I am\n\n   Can you help me be someone?\n\n   They have broken me\n\n   Because I don\u2019t know who I am\n\n \n\n   As the second chorus kicks in, Tana steps forward again, once again trying to take point for herself. However, Fang\u2019s bass remains overpowering, which only adds more to the unmelodious nature of the song.\n\n \n\n   And I want a moment to be real,\n\n   Wanna touch things I don't feel,\n\n   Wanna hold on and feel I belong.\n\n   And how can the world want me to change?\n\n   They\u2019re the ones that stay the same.\n\n   They can\u2019t see me,\n\n   Because I\u2019m not here\n\n   They can tell me who to be\n\n   \u2018Cause I\u2019m exactly what they see\n\n   Yeah, the world is still sleepin\u2019,\n\n   While I keep on dreamin\u2019\n\n   And their words are just whispers\n\n   And lies that are all too real!\n\n \n\n   The final chorus kicks off. Tana doesn\u2019t even bother overpowering or trying to show off anymore. Much like with Fang, she\u2019s come to accept that the song\u2019s main driving tune is a mournful disharmony that speaks of her bandmate\u2019s broken soul...\n\n \n\n   And I want a moment to be real,\n\n   Wanna touch things I don't feel,\n\n   Wanna hold on and feel I belong.\n\n   And how can they say I never change?\n\n   They\u2019re the ones that stay the same.\n\n   I\u2019m still no one,\n\n   \u2018Cause I\u2019m not here.\n\n   I\u2019m not the one\n\n   I\u2019m not here\n\n   I\u2019m not here\n\n   I\u2019m not here... \n\n \n\n   When the final note plays, the venue somehow feels quieter than before. No one is clapping, and what few eyes and ears are present seem to be full of confusion, even displeasure. At least two of the patrons get up and walk out of the pizzeria in visible disgust, and the last remaining patron, a human wearing a black turtleneck and beanie, looks on with what almost could pass off for pity.\n\n   Tana removes the guitar strap from her neck and turns to look back at Fang. \u201cGilda\u2026\u201d she starts, her voice full of vitriol and face just barely holding back rage. \u201cWe\u2019re NEVER playing that song again!\u201d\n\n   Chadley, despite his usual sunny demeanor, stands up from his drum set and walks up to Fang, putting a hand on her shoulder. He shakes his head, wordless agreeing with Tana before walking off the small stage. The magenta triceratops grabs her guitar case and stuffs her instrument in without a word, following after him. Unlike Chadley however, she stops and turns to face her bandmate with a sour expression on her face.\n\n   \u201cDespite that last song being\u2026 as soul-crushing as ever\u2026 good show... I guess.\u201d\n\n   Fang lets out a snort through her nose. She hates it when Tana gets all patronizing. \u2018Not like she cares. She doesn\u2019t even do this for a living\u2026\u2019 she bitterly thinks as she looks at the barely fifteen-year-old high schooler. She joined her band less out of a desire to and more because it was a convenient mutual arrangement for both of them. Still, Tana and Chadley are about the only people Fang interacts with on the regular. They\u2019re the closest things she had to friends nowadays, even though she knows almost nothing about their lives besides that they choose to torture themselves with her presence. \u2018Not that I even deserve friends in the first place\u2026\u2019 she somberly tells herself before letting out a sigh.\n\n   \u201cHey, Gilda. Have you ever considered playing the guitar instead of bass?\u201d Tana suddenly asks Fang, forcing her away from her current train of thoughts.\n\n   Fang thinks back to when she had last picked up a guitar and played it more than decently. Just that had catapulted her playing from \u2018dreadful\u2019 to \u2018almost decent.\u2019 Yet as the warm memory of playing the instrument and letting herself soar with the music filled her soul, it also brought with it memories of the person who had convinced her to switch over to a guitar\u2026\n\n   Instantly Fang shook her head and shot a glare at her bandmate. \u201cI\u2019ll play whatever the hell I want, got it?\u201d\n\n   Tana sighs and shrugs before turning around, walking away without so much as another word. Fang notices how Tana picks up her pace to meet up with Chadley, who was waiting for her by the pizzeria entrance. Soon as the two lock eyes, they begin to chat among themselves like they were high-school buddies. Given their respective age ranges, fifteen for Tana and seventeen for Chadley, they probably were.\n\n   At first, Fang let out a low hiss, almost like a vampire seeing the crucifix of Raptor Jesus. The hiss then turns into a deep and gloomy sigh. The ptero spares one more look at her bandmates, a pang of regret erupting in the spot where her heart once lay. She should be nicer to the only people on this planet who still put up with her bullshit. Yet, she can\u2019t bring herself to feel anything other than bitterness. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been for four years, and that\u2019s how it feels like it will be for the rest of her life. \n\n   \u2018What a pathetic existence,\u2019 Fang thinks as she greedily gulps down the last of her water, not even caring that the liquid smears her black lipstick. She thinks back to how she had once told someone dear to her that people were like weeds, only existing to get stepped on while she moved ahead. Despite their attempts at being cordial, her bandmates are no different. She only needs to reciprocate their comradeship enough to keep up a working relationship. They are her meal ticket, and the last thing she wants is to alienate yet more people in her life. \u2018Even if that's my best fucking quality,\u2019 the ptero somberly thought. \n\n   With a sneer of disgust, Fang kicks the amp next to her. There\u2019s no point sparing another thought on self-pity. Pity is not going to clear up her debt. Pity is not going to give her enough to live on beyond a shitty one-room apartment that doesn't even have air conditioning. Pity isn\u2019t going to magically undo all of her stupid life\u2019s mistakes, and pity certainly won\u2019t help her find more gigs. Instead of wasting precious energy on idle and worthless thoughts, she packs away the last of her equipment. As she does, she notices someone standing near the stage in the dimly lit pizzeria, staring at her like she is a sight for sore eyes. A human of all things. The same human that had stared intently at her like she was the most beautiful of muses\n\n   Fang scoffs at the notion of anyone\u2014let alone a human\u2014finding her attractive. Maybe the ape is high or drunk off his ass. Maybe he has a fetish for dinos. Maybe the guy is schizo and off his rocker. Whatever the case, he's just another weirdo out to make her night that extra bit more miserable. As if shit couldn't be more miserable already.\n\n   Fang ignores the human to the best of her abilities while she finishes locking up her bass in its case. Unlike everything else she owns, her bass is the one thing she took care of like an offspring. More than just a keepsake from a better time, it\u2019s her only worldly possession that held real value. Sure, there are also negative memories tied to it, but they serve as reminders of what not to do in the future. A glance at the nicks and scratches on the instrument make the ptero realize the oppressive flow of time. To think that it has been almost four years since she had last spoken to her family. Four years since she had last seen hide or hair of her former friends. Friends she had so callously tossed away in a fit of rage and paranoia, all thanks to a certain person she had once believed loved her for who she was, only to be proven dead wrong when he revealed that it was all the plan of some machiavellian bitch named Naomi. As she thinks of that bitch Naomi, she can\u2019t help but wonder what any of her old friends are doing now. \u2018Certainly something a hell of a lot better than what I\u2019m doing,\u2019 Fang thinks with the kind of exhaustion not even a hundred years of sleep could ever hope to fix. Yet as she thinks back on Trish, Reed, Rosa, and Stella, she feels unworthy of holding them in her memory. How could she, when she had so readily cut them off from her life in the first place?\n\n   There it is again, that pang in Fang's chest. That damnable pang that shouldn't exist\u2014couldn't exist\u2014in her hollowed state. Yet there it is, nagging at her very soul. It screams and kicks like a child throwing the world's worst tantrum.\n\n   Gritting her teeth and taking a deep breath, Fang gathers the last of her pitiful belongings. As she does, she forces her body and mind to go numb. What she wouldn't give right now for a smoke of whatever Reed used to fill his lungs with back in High School. She looks in the direction of the pizzeria\u2019s pitifully stocked bar, \u2018At least drinks are on the house tonight\u2026\u2019\n\n   Part of Fang\u2019s pay for playing at Pizza Time is access to alcohol, something her younger bandmates couldn\u2019t enjoy yet. Legally anyway. She knew the two drank on the side. She isn't going to stop them, though. It isn\u2019t like she\u2019s their guardian. \n\n   \u2018Whatever the fuck Tana and Chadley do on their time\u2019s their business, not mine,\u2019 Fang thinks as she settles on drinking the stiffest, most arduous liquor she can get her hands on tonight. She deserves a cold one after playing for two hours.\n\n   A small part of Fang, probably all that remains of her former self, reminds her how booze had set her down the path she now walked. The ptero quickly shuts that voice up. It\u2019s too late to be sorry about what she did to wind up in her situation.\n\n   Four years too late to change anything\u2026\n\n   A voice suddenly pulls Fang from her thoughts. The voice belongs to the human who, up to that point, has been ogling her like he\u2019s a ravenous horndog. Fang turns to face him, realizing that he\u2019s the only person left in the entire restaurant. Even the waiters and the bartender appear to have cleared up. Is it really that late at night, or had they fled after that last song?\n\n   Fed up with the usual bullshit she puts up with daily, Fang let out a low, almost feral growl in response to the human\u2019s words. \u201cFuck off!\u201d she hisses dryly, without so much as sparing a single glance at the human's eyes. She doesn\u2019t even wait for a reply from the evolved ape as she grabs her belongings and makes her way off the stage.\n\n   \u201cL-Lucy\u2026?\u201d the human calls out just loud enough for Fang's ears to catch.\n\n   Hearing that old, almost forgotten name, Fang feels a bright hot rage bubble in her. It threatens to consume her as she whips around with eyes like daggers at the heckling human. \u2018How did he know my old name?\u2019 She asks herself as she seizes the human before her with a vicious glare. \u2018Who the fuck is he?\u2019\n\n   As if to answer Fang\u2019s silent question, the human steps forward, out of the dim light of the Pizzeria and into the brighter lights of the stage. \n\n   The human\u2019s plain black turtleneck and navy blue pants almost make him look like a thug, yet at the same time, he doesn\u2019t look like a hobo or junkie. For one thing, she can see some well-defined musculature even with the slightly loose clothing he\u2019s wearing. He also carries himself with a presence that is pretty hard to pin down properly. The only thing the jaded ptero can tell for sure is that he has just about zero fucks left to give.  What was more, unlike other humans, the one now staring her in the eye had little in the way of remarkable facial features. If she were looking at him from a distance, she could even swear he has no discernable face to speak of.\n\n   It hits Fang like a freight train going at a hundred miles an hour. She drops her bass case and grimaces, the rage bubbling through her veins, making her whole body feel at least ten degrees hotter. But just as quickly as the anger rises, it not only cools but practically freezes over. Something about the man before her feels familiar, like some long-forgotten memory calling out to her\u2026 one she barely wanted to acknowledge despite it screaming loudly and desperately at her. Whatever it is that wants to claw its way back to the forefront of her mind is having a hard time getting past the usual maelstrom of recollections and regrets. \n\n   Another glare at the human has something in her brain click, and she suddenly remembers why the face brought out so much anguish and confusion in her. Those barely visible eyes of his, that blank yet unique expression\u2014one she had fought so hard for four years to kill all recollections of to no real avail\u2026 \n\n   The fire inside fang's soul turns to acid.\n\n   \u2018You... YOU!\u2019 Fang venomously thinks. As more and more memories she had believed long-buried rise up to the surface, she grits her teeth and clenches her hands into fists. The force on her jaw is so tight that it makes her teeth ache and her gums quake. A torrent of emotions begin raging within the ptero\u2019s soul\u2014none good, and none that she knows how to handle without violence. \n\n   \u201cWhat do YOU want!?\u201d the dino asks so chillingly that her words could freeze the very sun.\n\n   The human wordlessly steps closer to Fang. As he does, the ptero notes how he is now very clearly not the human she remembers from four years ago, yet still the same man that she had once believed had loved her for who she was\u2026\n\n   \u201cAnon,\u201d Fang seethes with every bit of hatred that she can put into her voice.\n\n   Fang\u2019s already clenched hands tighten further. Her claws dig into the flesh of her palms, drawing blood as her knuckles turn white. Whatever pain she might feel is utterly overwritten by the inferno raging uncontrollably in her soul. At that moment, she wants nothing more than to rip Anon's chest open with her bare hands, showing him his still beating black heart as the life slowly leaves his eyes.\n\n   The ptero takes one step towards the human. Without wasting a single second, she raises an arm and snaps her shoulder back. With all the strength she can muster, she throws a punch directed right at Anon\u2019s face. A blow the human does nothing to avoid, parry, or even counter.\n\n   As the sound of a scaled fist meeting soft human flesh echoes through the abandoned restaurant, Fang can\u2019t help but feel some level of catharsis. It\u2019s several years too late and far too little to make any real difference, but as she feels her first bury itself into Anon's cheek, she feels a certain level of rapture. \n\n   Fang can\u2019t help but smile ever so faintly...\n\n   To Fang's surprise, Anon takes her punch without so much as flinching. At first, the ptero wonders if she\u2019s that weak, but as Anon's cheek turns a dark shade of red and rises a few millimeters in inflammation, her doubts evaporate. If anything, it\u2019s Anon who has gotten physically more robust.\n\n   Anon turns his head to once again gaze right into Fang\u2019s eyes. Fang puts away her surprise at Anon's resistance\u2014or numbness\u2014to once again glare daggers at him. However, as Fang's eyes meet Anon\u2019s, she feels overwhelmed by the deep sorrow she finds in them.\n\n   The ptero\u2019s previous hostility deflates as the sadness in Anon\u2019s eyes overwhelms her. Little by little, the fire and acid in her soul vanishes as a realization hits; that the human now staring deep into her soul is just as damaged\u2014if not more so\u2014than she is. The sorrow she can see in his gaze is but a fraction of the emotion she could feel in his soul. There is so much more just hidden away under the surface... \n\n   \u201cLucy\u2026\u201d Anon whispers as he takes another step forward towards the girl he had once loved, yet the one girl he had ruined everything with because of his selfishness and apathy. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d\n\n   Despite wanting nothing more than to kick Anon in the testicles and run away to hide from the feelings in her heart, Fang can only shake her head in denial. Goosebumps course through her body as for just one moment, she lets herself remember what Anon had been to her... and what she had been to him. How they had both ended it so unceremoniously, almost as if all those hours spent together, all those laughs shared, all that happiness that bounced between the two of them had meant nothing.\n\n   Fang steps even closer to Anon without another word and wraps her arms around the human\u2019s chest. Anon returned the embrace, doing his best to cradle the woman he had loved and so carelessly hurt four years ago.\n\n   As the night outside grew colder, Anon and Fang\u2014broken and beaten by a cruel and uncaring world\u2014found a small semblance of comfort in each other's embrace. It wasn't enough to heal the wounds or to undo all the mistakes the two had committed in their lives up to that point, but for just one second, it didn't matter...\n\n   Just for one second, it was a good place for the two of them to start again\u2026\n\n  \n   \n   -Two Weeks Earlier-\n\n   \u201cPeople never change...\u201d\n\n   Those are the words Anon repeats to himself as he walks down the streets of Skin Row. The box of pizza in his hand trembles as his mind and his soul duel over what emotion he should be feeling at that moment.\n\n   While brain, heart, and soul duel over what the human should be feeling, another part of Anon\u2019s mind races as a hundred different thoughts acost him, making his journey down to the smoke shop all the more arduous. As he nears the old and worn-down shop, all his thoughts begin merging into a single focus. Instead of easing his mental anguish, the cacophony of emotions and memories only serve to give him a splitting headache. \n\n   Anon turns away from the shop and finds the nearest bench to sit on. As he lets his body plop down on the hard concrete seat, he focuses his mind on a single stream of consciousness, one that hopefully wouldn\u2019t leave him feeling like a shoe inside a tumbling drying machine. It works for the most part, save for one rogue idea that refuses to go back into the deepest recesses of his mind no matter how hard he tries to push it down.\n\n   Anon puts a hand on his face and lets out a groan of physical and emotional pain. \u201cWhy of all people on this fucking planet did I have to run into her again?\u201d\n\n   Anon is dragged back unwillingly to just a few minutes earlier\u2026\n\n \n\n   Anon set eyes on the slightly worn-out sign in the window. \u201cPizza Time,\u201d the human said out loud, not sure what to make of the name. \n\n   From the looks of the eatery, it appears to be one of those family entertainment restaurants along the lines of Freedy Fazzbear\u2019s Pizza or Bon\u2019s Burgers he had always wanted to go to when he was younger. He never got the chance, because his parents either didn\u2019t have the time, the money, or both. Just from the worn sun-bleached lettering and the unkempt, barely cleaned glass, it\u2019s clear the restaurant has seen better days. The fact that it\u2019s smack-dab in the middle of Skin Row probably doesn\u2019t help any. The neighborhood had perhaps been a far better place to live decades ago when the restaurant was first built before the streets had been overrun by the gangs and all the impoverished people.\n\n   Anon didn\u2019t think much of the restaurant before his eyes. In truth, he only wants some cigarettes. Preferably the same brand his old high school buddy named Reed used to inhale like a chimney all the times they had hung out for guy\u2019s nights. Yet as he takes no more than three steps forward his stomach growls, followed by an unignorable pang of hunger racking at his stomach.\n\n   With a sigh of defeat, Anon retraced his steps and stepped into the eatery, a tiny bell chiming overhead. Pizza isn\u2019t precisely within his budget, but it isn\u2019t like he plans to be spending any more of his pension later this week anyway. He might as well live a little while he has some cash to burn. \n\n   The human looks around the restaurant\u2019s interior. Sure enough, it\u2019s far more spacious inside than the outside had led him to believe. Aside from at least three dozen old round tables dotted across the main dining area, there are a few booths meant for more private gatherings, and even a pair of large rectangular tables meant for catering events, such as birthday parties. The walls and ceilings are painted a faded blue-ish purple, and the floor is lined with hundreds of black ceramic tiles that look as worn and scratched as it\u2019s expected of such an old restaurant. As far as the restaurant\u2019s lighting went, several hundred round wire lanterns hang overhead, each holding an orange LED bulb that shines just brightly enough to keep the restaurant from becoming a tripping hazard. The overall color scheme gives the pizzeria a dark quality that even the lighting couldn\u2019t counteract. It reminds the young sailor about his time aboard the CVN-295 Judgment , the aircraft carrier he was assigned to not long after joining the navy. The only other thing worth noting is the sound of the pizzeria\u2019s arcade, which as expected, blasts out a loud racket of varying sounds that honestly make Anon wonder how anyone can listen to such a din without going mad within only a few minutes.\n\n   Aside from another human munching on a burger at a table and a couple of teen dinos kissing in one of the booths, the restaurant is pretty devoid of customers. Even the small bar which caters to parents while their children waste hard-earned money on prize tickets and short-lasting merriment lies utterly empty, the bartender sitting down to one side and reading a book while looking bored out of her mind.\n\n   At first, Anon has the urge to ask the dino tending the bar for a drink, but after considering his monetary situation and the early hours, he settles on only getting food. Scanning for a secluded table, Anon makes his way somewhere he concludes is just far enough away from \u2018the crowd\u2019 while still being visible to the waiters. The last thing he wants that day is to interact with anyone he doesn\u2019t need to. He finds a table with a broken chair and a lopsided base. \n\n   Not one minute passes before a waitress comes around to take his order. Flipping through the menu, Anon settles on getting a to-go order of a classic medium pizza with cheese and ham. He considers being bold and adding something extra like pineapples for a second, but he ultimately decided against it. Not that he hates pineapples on pizza\u2014far from it, he loves them unconditionally\u2014it was just two dollars extra for the added topping, which meant two dollars less for his cigarette budget, and that would not fly.  \n\n   As Anon hands the menu back to the waitress and refuses a drink of any kind, something other than the racket of the arcade machines and gotcha contraptions catches his attention. It\u2019s music. And not just any type of music, but live music\u2026 live music that sounds so very familiar to him... \n\n   The human follows the tunes with his ears, the sounds eventually leading his eyes to a tiny stage tucked near the restaurant\u2019s back. It\u2019s just barely in sight of the patrons, almost as if the point is for as few looks to fall on it as possible. There, on top of a platform just large enough for five people, three musicians stand playing in the beam of a single headlight.\n\n   Usually Anon wouldn\u2019t care about some nobody band playing such a tiny gig, but his attention falls on the trio of performers for reasons beyond his current comprehension. In particular their \u2018lead,\u2019 a monochromatic ptero who still has her back turned away from the \u2018crowd,\u2019 even though said crowd, consists of four people at most, none of which are even paying any attention to the music.\n\n   Glancing behind the monochromatic dino, Anon\u2019s eyes then fall on the band\u2019s drummer, who much to his shock isn\u2019t even a dinosaur, but a land shark instead. A megalodon, if he wanted to be more accurate. He was dressed like a stereotypical surfer, with a blue muscle shirt and a white pair of shorts, some long and slick black hair, and the kind of muscles you only get from daily trips to the public weightlifting areas of the beachside. The \u2018dude\u2019 seems to be into playing his drums; his eyes shut as he let the music\u2019s rhythm serve as his guide. In a way, it reminds Anon of his old buddy Reed, who also had the same habit. Whether or not the shark was also a heavy drug user\u2014or a drug user at all\u2014is still up for debate.\n\n      Standing almost directly in front of the land shark is a small light magenta-tone triceratops playing a very competent guitar solo. From her strumming speed and penchant for showy movement, she clearly is the band\u2019s lead guitarist. Her outfit is perhaps the most \u2018basic\u2019 out of her comrades, as she sported a plain white tank top and a black skirt. In fact, she looked squeaky clean by comparison and is far younger in appearance than either the ptero or land shark, almost like she\u2019s still attending middle school. Her size and general body shape remind Anon of another triceratops he used to know by the name of Trish. Unlike his memories of Reed, which are on the more pleasant side, his recollections of Trish only brought about discomfort. As he studies the triceratops girl more closely, he finds other comparisons to Trish, like short curly hair and an abnormally ample bosom-to-body ratio. If he didn\u2019t know any better, he would think he\u2019s witnessing a younger version of that diminutive terror play before his eyes.\n\n   Anon scoffs at the sour reminder of Trish. He still hasn\u2019t forgiven that purple bundle of joy for doxing him, which ensured that his last months of high school were as socially agonizing as possible. He half wonders what the tiny terror is up to these days, but he drops the question just as quickly as it had popped into his head. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s been about four years, so she has either gone to college or found herself some sucker to settle down with and terrorize.\n\n   Anon\u2019s eyes fall on the last member of the band, the ptero girl with her back turned to the world. Her coloration\u2014or rather, her lack of it\u2014reminds him of someone he used to know, but with her not bothering to face the world, he can\u2019t tell who. Not that he cares anyway. Her bass strumming is pretty harsh and discordant, even if technically melodic and well constructed. Without seeing the dino\u2019s face, he would never know more of the ptero girl apart from her backside. In that regard though, she at least has it going on.\n\n   Anon tears his eyes away from the pitiful band and brings out his phone. He turns on the device and scrolls through a few gun nut forums. For a second he gets the urge to do a bit of shitposting, for old time\u2019s sake. Ultimately he decides against it. Once again, he can\u2019t bring himself to care enough to get mad at some random person over the internet. \n\n   As Anon considers putting on some earphones he had brought with him from home, the band\u2019s bassist begins to sing. Her voice is dulcet for being in a shitty three-person band. More than the surprise of hearing a decent voice coming from what otherwise looks like a garage band, it\u2019s the voice itself that made the human\u2019s entire world stop at that second.\n\n   No matter how hard the young sailor had tried to suppress it, no matter how many times he had forced his mind to erase the memory of it, he can never forget that voice\u2026\n\n   Anon again gazed up at the band. As he did, the bassist, at last, turns to face what few patrons are in the restaurant. As his eyes focus on the lead singer he sees her, standing there, singing a song he had thought all but repressed in the most bottomless darkest pits of his memory\u2026 \u201c...Fang\u2026\u201d he found himself whispering to no one in particular.\n\n   The human barely recognizes his ex. A part of him even tries to deny that the pterosaur on stage is even her. Yet the more he observes, the more his rational mind clarifies it. Yes, the woman standing on that platform singing a song that he knew by heart was in fact, Fang.\n\n   \u2018The years haven\u2019t been kind to you,\u2019 is the first thing that crosses Anon\u2019s mind as he studies his ex\u2019s physical appearance. A shaved head, gaudy and painful-looking tattoos down both arms, and thick black eyeliner that makes her once bright and lively citrine eyes look dull and lifeless. Black-painted lips twist into a scowl of desolation\u2014the kind that only having one\u2019s soul crushed beyond any hope of repair can earn\u2014he can hardly believe that the woman before him is the same girl he had dated four years earlier. It would be easier to say that she\u2019s some twisted doppelganger or a parody of the girl he remembers, but the more he looks, the more he realizes that his eyes aren\u2019t playing some kind of trick on him.\n\n   Anon almost doesn\u2019t notice the waitress handing him the order he put minutes ago. After giving the waitress his money for the food, he stands and dares to walk a bit closer to the stage. As he does, a part of him hopes that Fang will look his way, that she would recognize him and realize that he was the only one that cared enough to watch and listen to her and her band playing their music. But as she scans the restaurant robotically, her eyes pass by the human, their dull gaze ignorant to the fact that someone is looking back who had once cared for her.\n\n   Anon turned away from the stage with a sigh. \u2018It\u2019s actually sobering,\u2019 he muses as he makes his way out of the restaurant. A part of him had hoped it would not be so, but the more he rationalizes it the more it makes sense to him. It was fun to pretend that it might go somewhere. That Fang would recognize him, drop her instrument, race towards his arms, and put all the pain and anguish from the last four years behind her. That they would forgive each other for all those hurtful shitty things they said to each other that horrible night and start over from square one.\n\n   Anon stops in his tracks and spares one last glance back. \u2018She\u2019s right there,\u2019 he conceives with all the bravery his foolish heart can muster. \u2018I can take everything back. Everything that went to shit because of that fight. If I try talking to her, she might forgive me. Things could go back to the way they were, back before\u2026\u2019\n\n   Anon\u2019s mind once again goes blank. Another memory supplants his thoughts as the voice of the woman now singing shouts those painful words:\n\n    \u201cTrish was right about you!\u201d\n\n   Anon lets out a long sigh, turns his eyes to the floor, and walks out of the restaurant altogether; his mind now set only on finding cigarettes. With every step away from the eatery, his mind further cements that he is doing the right thing. Though he tries to erase the last few minutes from his mind, he knows the memory will stay with him for the rest of his life\u2026\n\n \n\n   Anon lights his last cigarette, takes a long and deep drag of smoke that would even impress Reed, and stands up from the bench. The sudden intake of nicotine helps dull his headache as he forces some semblance of order on his thoughts. With a still-shaky hand, the human reaches into his pizza box and takes out a slice of the still-warm pie.\n\n   As Anon takes a sizable bite of the cardboard-tasting pizza he had spent about ten dollars on, he tries to force himself to feel some semblance of joy. \u2018I have not one fucking care in the world now,\u2019 he muses, albeit half-heartedly. \u2018No school to stress about, no navy to return to short of a war, and most importantly, not one person to tell me how to use my shitty pension!\u2019 He takes another drag of his cigarette and forces a smile on his lips, the muscles on his cheek screaming in soreness from years of atrophy. He is right on the money. He has no care left in the world except himself. He\u2019s free from all accountability.\n\n   It\u2019s reassuring, in a twisted, awful sort of way, but that was how Anon likes it. He isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s because he has grown numb or if he has just given up trying to feel, but the apathetic cynicism is a welcome escape from the hell that has been his life up to this point.\n\n   Or at least that\u2019s what he tells himself\u2026\n\n   As Anon continues his way to the smoke shop, there is something that nags at his soul. A feeling that he can\u2019t get rid of no matter how hard he tries. Before he can reach the store, the feeling evolves into a pain in his heart that makes every step absolute agony. It isn\u2019t quite physical distress, but to him it sure as hell feels like it. The tendrils of despondency spread throughout his being, running deep into his presence, wholly metaphysical and nearly impossible to describe without some kind of degree in psychology.\n\n   The human steps into the shop and focuses on his current goal. As he does, his discomfort continues to evolve. Now, even his eyes feel heavy and laden with moisture seeking an escape. As he picks up some weed-based cigarettes from the shop, his discomfort further evolves, eventually feeling like some kind of thorn got stuck to his being, one he can\u2019t reach and pluck out. Anon storms towards the liquor aisle in a desperate bid and scans for the highest proof alcohol he can find. Only seconds later, he spots a bottle of imported vodka from one of the former Soviet block countries. The label says that it is 96% proof, which means a good night and a wild party to most.\n\n   \u2018This ought to get me nice and wasted,\u2019 Anon thinks as he puts his two purchases together. Sure, the drink is far more expensive than anything he would normally get, but if he can\u2019t force the pain in his soul down through willpower, then he\u2019s going to drown it out with booze strong enough to be vehicle fuel.\n\n   Anon pays with his government-issued debit card and leaves the store as fast as his legs can carry him. Without any other delay, he begins his trek back to Skin Row. On the way, he again passes by the same restaurant where he accidentally ran into Fang. Though he tells himself not to, some subconscious instinct forces his head to once more look towards the back of the pizzeria. Though the glass is grimy and covered in scratches and etched graffiti, he can just barely make out the still playing figure of his ex-girlfriend, still strumming away at her base and silently singing despite her eyes looking sullen and dead.\n\n   Anon forces his head to turn away as he sets his pace to a brisk power walk. Though his mind is still abuzz with thoughts and ideas that he can\u2019t\u2014or rather doesn\u2019t\u2014want to act on, the thought of returning to his apartment alone with a pizza, smokes, and booze to watch a movie and enjoy his life undisturbed\u2014with no judgment for his appearance or the place he lived in\u2014fills him with relief\u2026 even if that relief feels hollow and artificial.\n\n   \u2018It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted,\u2019 Anon reasons to himself, even though a part of him\u2014he isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s his mind or his soul\u2014screams in refutation. \u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever needed\u2026\u201d he adds, this time in a mumble only he can hear.\n\n   As Pizza Time gets farther and farther away from his view, Anon raises his one free hand and half-heartedly waves at it. \u201cGoodbye, Fang. It was nice seeing you again... I suppose\u2026 because I haven\u2019t changed,\u201d he says loud and clear, the words in his mouth overpowering the taste of cigarette with what feels like bile.\n\n   \u201c...Because people never change\u2026\u201d","Title":"A Better End","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Fang, Naser, Trish, Tana, Reed, Chadley, Stella, Rosa, Joshua and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Rangto","Summary":"Four years after his service in the Navy, Anon returns to the town where he experienced some of the best and worst times of his high school life.

His eyes are set to the sky first, his sight set on the light of the stars above, their eons-old radiance ever-present and luminous.\n\n   Next to the human stood a pterodactyl of beautiful light cyan skin and plumage and shining silver hair. Her presence, unlike his, was warm and reassuring even in the cold night air. So long as she stood next to him, everything would be right with the world. Lucy's brilliance would dispel any and all fears he may have carried in his heart.\n\n   \u201cI got a contract here with a studio here. I\u2019m thinking\u2026\u201d Anon said, hesitating for a second. In that momentary pause, he took a fast yet deep breath of air to steel himself before continuing his words. \u201c...Since I\u2019ll be here for a good while, how about we get some dinner sometime. Y\u2019know\u2026 together.\u201d\n\n   Anon, soon as he finishes speaking his words, turns his gaze towards Lucy. Lucy, for her part, has her eyes set to the night sky as well, but as the seconds pass by, a dusting of pink crosses her cheeks.\n\n   \u201cI would\u2026 I totally would, Anon\u2026\u201d Lucy answers as she brings her eyes to meet mine. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got work like you wouldn\u2019t believe!\u201d she adds, all the while letting a slight sight escape her lips.\n\n   Anon feels slightly deflated by Lucy\u2019s response. \u201cO-oh. Well, if it\u2019s too much\u2014\u201d \n\n   \u201cHOWEVER!\u201d Lucy interjects, cutting off whatever words Anon was about to say. She then places her hands over Anon\u2019s, all the while her eyes remain fixed on those of the human. \u201cI\u2019ve got time in the morning. So how about breakfast?\u201d\n\n   Anon\u2019s lips rise. \u201cIs that a date then?\u201d he asks cheekily.\n\n   Lucy gives Anon a mischievous little simper. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Is it?\u201d\n\n   \u201cIt is then,\u201d Anon reaffirms to Lucy.\n\n   Lucy lets out a giggle, her cheeks growing ever pinker in the process. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dweeb,\u201d Lucy said as she shuffled closer towards Anon until their legs pressed together.\n\n   \u201cI know,\u201d Anon replied to Lucy as he moved his chest ever closer towards Lucy. Lucy, in turn, leaned her head on Anon\u2019s shoulder, who in turn wrapped his arm around her shoulder.\n\n   \u2018Feels like old times,\u2019 Anon thought as he allowed Lucy\u2019s warmth to fill his being. \u2018Like no time\u2019s passed since I left Volcadera Bluffs.\u2019 He looked up to the sky, his gaze falling on the bright almost full moon. \u2018I guess I never did say goodbye to Volcano High,\u2019 he mused to himself.\n\n   A short snort and a tiny giggle left Lucy\u2019s nose and lips as she turned her eyes back on Anon. \u201cThanks, now my face is forever stuck in a cringe.\u201d\n\n   Anon rolled his eyes. \u201c Way to ruin the moment,\u201d he said, the grin on his lips only growing wider by the second.\n\n   \u201cYou ruined it first with you mumbling,\u201d Fang retorted with a matter-of-factly look.\n\n   \u201cFix it then,\u201d Anon riposted.\n\n   \u201cYou ruined it. You fix it,\u201d Fang countered.\n\n   Anon shifted Lucy in his arms and brought her up within inches of his face. \u201cFine. I will,\u201d he said, his hand cupping Lucy\u2019s cheek. Lucy, in turn, softly smiled and leaned in for a well-earned kiss\u2026\n\n \n\n   Anon jolted awake. \n\n   With a groan of pain and a whimper of sorrow, Anon forced himself upright. His body refused to move for a full ten seconds before he forced himself to sit. As he did, he felt wrapped in something he hadn\u2019t felt in what to him felt like decades: warmth and comfort. \n\n   Anon breathed through his mouth. His mind struggled both to process what he had seen in his dream all the while fighting to preserve any memory of it before the cold uncaring oblivion of wakefulness claimed them. \n\n   Anon brought a hand up to his face, wiping away sweat from his face. Except that what he was wiping from his eyes and cheek wasn\u2019t sweat...\n\n   For almost a week now, Anon had been experiencing the dreams. They always started the same, with him relieving the most important days of his high school life. The dreams would then go into wildly different directions than what his life had taken. Regardless of how they played out, all lead him to some happily ever after with Fang and Trish and Naser and Reed and Rosa and Stella. \n\n   For almost a week, Anon had seen events that were far too good for an apathetic caveman like himself. Each dream resulted in happiness and joy for all his old friends\u2026 as well as for himself... \n\n   ...Even though he knew deep down that he didn\u2019t deserve happiness of any kind...\n\n   Anon picked himself up from bed and raced for his fridge. Tossing out old food containers and empty bottles of juice, he found what he had been searching for. Another bottle of high-proof vodka, this one 120. Without equivocation, he chugged down what might as well have been rubbing alcohol. As the liquid traveled down his esophagus, he let out a hiss as the liquid burned his throat. He then walked to his desk and pulled out a blunt of weed from a homemade cigarette pack. Looking down, Anon realized that it was his last roll. With some hesitation\u2014and a trembling hand\u2014he lit a match and set the cigarette alight. A second later, he almost inhaled the whole blunt of weed, holding the smoke in his lungs for almost half a minute before exhaling. Within ten seconds, his mind became abuzz once again with memories of the various dreams he had experienced so far. Memories in which he saw his friends joyfully living lives they deserved. Memories in which he saw Lu\u2014Fang, working a job she loved, following her dreams without compromise, and loving him as deeply as any woman can love a man\u2026\n\n   Anon once again brought his head to his hands, sweat once more pouring from his face and staining his hands, body, and floor. He tried to wipe the sweat away, but the more he rubbed his face, the harder the sweat flowed. \n\n   Anon did his best to try and calm down, but as the minutes ticked by, he began to feel a strange sensation on his being. Little by little, his apartment began feeling far too small and far too hot for him to bear. The memories also returned in full force, sending his mind reeling with confusion and chaos. The memories of a happier home he would never have. Clean walls devoid of cracks and blemishes. Portraits of a happy family without a worry in the world...\n\n   Anon stood on his feet and began glancing around his apartment in a panic. The very walls judged him for his failures. They jeered and laughed and reminded him how much of a real fuck-up he was....\n\n   Anon had to get away; find a place that was wide open, one where he could escape. One where the walls couldn't find him in.\n\n   Wasting no time, Anon snuffed his blunt and slipped on his usual drab attire. After sliding on his black turtleneck and putting on the black and worn wool beanie he brought back from his time as a seaman, Anon headed for his apartment's exit. \n\n   Right before he exited his home, Anon took another look at his bottle of vodka near his fridge. With a grimace, he snatches the bottle. Hesitating for a second, he downed another large swig. After yet another hard grunt, he placed the bottle in one of his pant's pockets and stepped into the hallway.\n\n   Already feeling lightheaded, Anon struggled a bit with locking his door. After some fumbling with his keys, he successfully worked the door\u2019s mechanism. \n\n   With that small victory under his belt, Anon took off like a man on a mission. His pace was on the normal side for an ex-navy member. It was practically a jog when compared to the average person out on the street though. Within a matter of only ten minutes, he was more than halfway done with walking a mile.\n\n   As Anon aimlessly moved down the streets of Skin Row,  Anon's booze-addled mind couldn't fathom where his body was going. In the few instances where he had some form of lucidity, he course-corrected. By the time he had exited Skin Row, he was well on his way towards the shore. \n\n   Anon wasn\u2019t sure why his body moved towards the beach. Maybe it was because some part of him actually missed the smell of the ocean. Maybe it was because his body felt hot and he wanted\u2014needed\u2014to cool off. Whatever the case, it seemed like his lizard brain had settled on the course. Gradually, his pace became faster. First a power walk, then a full-on sprint.\n\n   Anon\u2019s legs pushed his body forward at a pace that could have matched Naser during his track and field prime. To any observer, the human looked like some kind of stereotypical robber. With the bottle of vodka in his hand though, he could pass for some kind of Gopnik after hearing the words \u2018free vodka\u2019 echoed in the distance. To further add to his Gopnik appearance, he took a swig of his vodka every few minutes. In his drunkenness, he had confused the bottle in his hand for water. While the human thought he was hydrating, he was in reality only getting drunker... on top of already being high.\n\n   When Anon reached Volcadera Bluffs\u2019 shores, he was well beyond drunk. The world was a spinning swirl in his eyes. What little of the beach he could see mixed together with bitter memories. Memories that were his and memories that he was sure couldn\u2019t be his. In those memories, or hallucinations\u2014Anon couldn't tell anymore\u2014everyone he had once known was happy\u2026 something he was pretty sure he had destroyed with a nuclear bomb.\n\n   In a brief moment of lucidity, Anon took in his surroundings. As he did, what little hold he still had on his sanity began to slip as he realized where his legs had carried him\u2026\n\n   ...The beach where he had fucked everything up... \n\n   The exact same spot, even.\n\n   Anon frantically glanced around, his addled and swirling vision doing him no favors. What his eyes couldn\u2019t rationalize as an image, his brain filled in with repressed memories. Little by little, the past and the present mixed together. He could see Fang\u2019s face of rage and sorrow as clear as if it happened yesterday. He could see her body language as he tore down everything the two had built together. He could feel the two teen's booze-addled minds loosening their lips and removing any and all inhibitors. \n\n   Anon heard himself screaming all the horrible things that night as clear as if they were happening in the present...\n\n   \u201cProbably couldn\u2019t fix you if I tried\u2026\u201d\n\n   Anon felt ill. Like his very innards wanted to become his outwards...\n\n   \u201cYou should be glad I\u2019ve put up with your shit as long as I have!\u201d\n\n   \u2018Please, no more!\u2019 Anon demanded of his brain.\n\n   \u201cI deserve a fuckin\u2019 prize or something!\u201d\n\n   \u2018No. Please. That\u2019s enough!\u2019 Anon pleaded as he fell on his knees, his head feeling like it was getting squeezed by a vice.\n\n   \u201cNot like anyone else would put up with a mentally ill schizo like you!\u201d\n\n   \u2018NO! NO! NOO!\u2019 Anon squirmed out, unsure of if it was a mumble or in his head. In response to his confusion and all the self-loathing he felt in that instant, he began to punch himself in the face like some kind of lunatic.\n\n   \u201cYOU DON\u2019T EVEN MAKE A PASSABLE FAGGOT!!\u201d\n\n   \u201cNOOOOOOO!\u201d Anon shouted as hard as his lungs would allow. His shout echoed in the empty streets behind him, but it carried out well out into the empty ocean and the cold uncaring sky. Sweat once again saturated his face and outfit as his body began to shiver.\n\n   No. Not sweat. Tears. Tears long-suppressed flowed unhindered by any of the human\u2019s many self inhibitions. \n\n   Bitter tears that felt like acid upon his skin.\n\n   Without wasting another second, Anon once more began to beat himself. While doing a poor job of actually doing damage due to the haphazard nature of his blows, they at least served to rattle his mind. Each successful punch brought him closer to the sweet embrace of oblivion. \n\n   When Anon felt that his self-harm was failing to knock him out, he dragged himself towards the nearest hard surface he could spot. In that case, it was what looked like a cement bench. \n\n   With no hesitation left in him, Anon began beating his head against the cold hard concrete. With every strike to his head, he cursed himself for his mistakes; the many, MANY mistakes he had made over the years:\n\n   How he had been so cruel toFang when she had been the only person to care for his sorry ass.\n\n   How he had been the catalyst for Fang cutting ties with all her old friends and family.\n\n   How he had never bothered to bury the hatchet with Trish, which resulted in Fang falling out with her.\n\n   How he hadn\u2019t bothered to apologize\u2014or even care\u2014about Fang after their fight.\n\n   How he had cut himself off from the world like some cowards.\n\n   How he had run away from his mistake like a little bitch.\n\n   How he had grown cold and detached from the world at large, to the point that he stopped caring about living.\n\n   How he had again failed to do the right thing and apologized to Fang in that restaurant.\n\n   How he had let his apathy once again ruin his chance at starting the healing process between himself and Fang.\n\n   How he had tried to drink and smoke the dreams away instead of manning up and accepting the message they were trying to tell him...\n\n   By the time Anon hit his head one final time, he could feel his awareness slipping from away. But right before the last of his consciousness left him, he raised a hand up towards the night sky.\n\n   \u201cFuck\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019m not a religious man\u2026 b-but Raptor Jesus\u2026 if\u2026 if you are f-fucking hearing my w-words\u2026\u201d \n\n   Anon\u2019s eyes once more welled with tears, what little vision he had becoming distorted by the veritable dam. \n\n   \u201cPlease\u2026 I\u2019m s-so... so... fucking...sorry\u2026 for my f-fuck ups!\u201d \n\n   Anon took a deep breath and steeled himself for words that he never thought he would say out loud\u2026\n\n   \u201cPlease! G-give me... ano-another... chance! L-let me\u2026 l-let me set this f-fucking mess right! F-for their sakes a-and\u2026 not m-mine\u2026\u201d \n\n   Anon again breathed soft, his vision becoming consumed by the dawning embrace of unconsciousness. \n\n   \u201cP-please\u2026\u201d Anon whispered one final time before the last bit of his consciousness left him. \n\n   \"P-plea...\"\n\n   \"...\"\n\n   Anon\u2019s body went as still as a corpse...\n\n \n\n   It was five in the morning. At least, that\u2019s what the clock on the car\u2019s dashboard said. \n\n   A lime-toned stegosaur rode on the passenger seat of a fairly modern van. She let out a tired yawn as she sunk her body deeper into the car seat. \u2018I guess I shouldn\u2019t have stayed up all night rewatching Gurren Lagann,\u2019 she mused with a mixture of self-scolding and pride. \u2018Ten hours well spent though.\u2019\n\n   Despite her drowsiness from awakening ten minutes earlier, the steg scanned the city vista with interest. As the building whizzed by, her mind projected a small running dino parkouring in pace with the van\u2019s speed. It made her giggle to herself. \n\n   Stella knew it was juvenile to rely on a children\u2019s trick to keep her boredom in check. She had never been one to follow 'standard' growing conventions though. In her eyes, it worked both to keep her entertained and awake. If it worked, it worked. Besides, the world already saw her as a cheerful weeb. It was an outlook that had been with her since elementary school. It was also an outlook she had no qualms in keeping. Short of an apocalyptic event taking society back to the Stone Age, she would stay a weeb until her dying days.\n\n   A cheeky smile formed on Stella\u2019s lips as she thought about what kind of funeral a weeb like her should have. There were plenty of themes she could pick. It had to be something she enjoyed, otherwise, what was the point? She first thought about Neon Genesis Evangelion. 'I mean, that can work,' she mused. NGE was the first anime she ever watched. An uncle had introduced her to it, and on seeing the first few episodes, it had been like love at first sight. From there, NGE served as her gateway to the world of mecha anime, which in turn served as her gateway to anime in general. She started with all the classics like the early Gundams, Macross, and Armored Trooper Votoms. From there, she moved to stuff like The Visions of Escaflowne, King of the Braves Gaogaigar, and Gunbuster. She then got into more contemporary stuff like the Big O and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Gurren Lagann and its celebration of mecha through the years\u2014as well as its sheer galactic scope\u2014made it her absolute favorite anime of all time. \n\n   So with TTGL being Stella's absolute fave, it only made sense that her funeral should be TTGL themed. She pondered for a bit how that would work out though. After about ten seconds of thinking, she decided that it was a topic best saved for somewhere other than a car ride. After all, she had years to plan it out. 'Besides, it's the music that sets the mood,' she told herself with a bit too much excitement. 'When I go, I'm going to have Libera Me from Hell playing on repeat for at least twenty-four hours. If they refuse, then I'm not going to my funeral.' \n\n   With her happy thoughts all but settled for the time being Stella closed her eyes for a few seconds. She had been using her eyes for hours after all, and it wasn't like she was going to fall asleep that easily.\n\n   A few seconds of silence passed by; time in which Stella felt quite relaxed and quite at peace with the world...\n\n   \u201cHey! \u00a1Despiertate!\u201d the voice of the van\u2019s driver, an orange ankylosaur, snapped Stella out from her trance-like state.\n\n   \u201cI-I\u2019m awake!\u201d Stella yelled reflexively. She blinked the haze out of her eyes and looked at her surroundings. Upon ascertaining that she was not in any danger, she snapped her sight towards her combined boss, business partner, and best friend. \u201cWha\u2014wha\u2019s happenin', Rosa?\"\n\n   Rosa let out an amiable chuckle in response to her friend's physical reaction. \u201cAh, \u00a1Disculpame! I was only making sure you didn\u2019t fall asleep on me before we got started on our cardio!\u201d she exclaimed. \"We're two minutes away, so I don't want you sleeping on me!\" the ankylosaur cheered as she turned the steering wheel left before accelerating.\n\n   \"But Rosa! I was getting comfy!\" \n\n   Rosa once again laughed. \u201cMaybe you wouldn\u2019t be such a dormilona if you hadn't stayed up so late watching anime.\"\n\n   Stella crossed her arms and puffed her cheeks. \u201cOh come on. You know well that when I get into a show, I can\u2019t just stop watching it!\u201d\n\n   Rosa let out a single laugh in response to Stella\u2019s statement. \u201c\u00a1Que bichita todavia eres!\u201d She said in her native Spanish before reaching out and rubbing the stego on the head, being careful not to ruffle her green hair too much. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything against you enjoying your anime. Just the anime getting in the way of your sleeping hours.\u201d The orange dino's face turned stern as soon as she finished her words. \"Can't have one of my employees tired at work. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! That\u2019s when I gotta put my foot down!\u201d Almost as if to augment her point, she hit the brakes a little harder than usual. As a result, the van came to a halt with a small jerk, causing Stella to lunge forward in her seat a bit.\n\n   Stella, cheeks still puffed in annoyance, thought of something to say to Rosa. \u2018You\u2019re one to talk, what with how you obsess over your telenovelas!\u2019 The sentence constituted in her brain, words taking shape at the tip of her tongue. She wanted to say it to Rosa too\u2026 \n\n   But the more thought Stella gave it, the more she decided against saying anything. In the end, she deflated her cheeks and only nodded in acknowledgment.\n\n   \"\u00a1Perfecto!\" Rosa cheered as she started to better park her van.\n\n   'Yeah,' Stella thought as she tried to put their interaction in the back of her mind. Deep down, she knew Rosa was only looking out for her wellbeing. It had been that way for the last four years, ever since her own parents more or less washed their hands of her. In their own words, Stella turned out to be an *'anime-obsessed, mystic bull believing, socially stunted excuse for a daughter.'* and pretty much kicked her to the curb. And what had brought about such a hostile exile? Her dream of moving to Japan to become an anime voice actress while also taking up divination and fortune-telling. Sure, accomplishing either goal was a long shot... and she didn\u2019t really have a plan to make any money in the meantime... but she was still determined to see that dream become real! \n\n   'Then again, I don't exactly have the best type of voice for an acting gig... nor do I really speak Japanese fluently despite watching thousands of hours of anime...'\n\n   So her voice acting dreams needed work. She was still amazing at Tarot readings! From her own admittedly biased record-keeping, she had yet to make a wrong prediction.\n\n   'Then again, I haven't exactly been able to practice my fortunetelling much in the last four years. Most people on the streets aren't exactly open to some stranger telling them about their futures. Not to mention...'\n\n   Stella's stomach suddenly felt like she had swallowed a cup full of ice. Her thoughts rewound to that one awful night. The night she made a huge mistake. The night that, with hindsight in its full and terrible might, she committed the single biggest mistake of her life. The night she gave that fateful fortune reading and failed to prevent a terrible fate from coming into fruition...\n\n   ...All because she failed to explain what one single card meant to the one person who needed it most...\n\n   Stella\u2019s heart sank as she remembered the moment in Pizza Moe\u2019s like it was yesterday...\n\n \n\n   \u201cI wanted to ask, what did you think of your fortune?\u201d\n\n   \u201cUh\u2026 I kinda forgot\u201d\n\n   \u201cYou got the Judgement, right?\u201d\n\n   \u201cDoesn\u2019t Ring a bell.\u201d\n\n   \u201cO-oh. Well\u2026 uh\u2026 How would you like another?\u201d\n\n   \u201cEh\u2026 I got time to kill. Sure.\u201d\n\n   \u201cAlright. Take one.\u201d\n\n   \u201cOh my\u2026 Inverted Empress. You... need to be wary about future negligence, Anon...\u201d\n\n   \u201cWhat the fuck does that mean?\u201d\n\n   \"Uh\u2026 er\u2026 Gottago,naturecalls,seeyouattheshow!\u201d\n\n \n\n   As the conversation played out in her memory, Stella had to ask herself why. Why had she rushed out from that situation despite Anon asking for clarification? Had it been her shyness overpowering her desire to help out Anon? Her lack of social skills in the face of such an important development in Anon\u2019s life? Or some misguided belief that Anon had to face his destiny alone despite needing help in walking the right path?\n\n   Stella didn't want to know the answers anymore. The answers wouldn't change the event that transpired that night, nor the aftermath. \n\n   Friendships died. People\u2019s lives abruptly changed. Joy turned to sorrow, and the world moved on regardless of who cried about it. \n\n   Stella\u2014for as naive and childish as some may have called her for it\u2014desperately wanted to believe that there was some other timeline in which everything turned out alright. \n\n   A timeline where she got her stuff together and made something of herself. \n\n   A timeline where all her friends stuck by with each other and helped each other grow to ever-higher heights. \n\n   A timeline where Anon and Fang stayed and had a happy life together...\n\n   \u201cHey. \u00a1Bicha!\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice snapped Stalla back to reality. \u201cWe\u2019re here! And look, we made it before sunrise! That'll give us plenty of time to do our cardio and\u2014\u201d Rosa paused in her tracks, her expression losing some of its cheer. \u201cAre you okay? You look sad. REALLY sad.\u201d the orange dino leaned closer to her friend\u2019s face. \u201cAre you teary-eyed?\u201d\n\n   Stella blinked a few times before running the back of her hand past her eyes. Sure enough, as she withdrew her hand, she noticed a few droplets of water glistening.\n\n   Stella took a deep breath and buried her previous thoughts. \u201cOh, this! I, uh\u2026 I was just remembering this\u2026 super ultra-emotional scene in an anime. Yeah!\u201d She once more put on a broad smile and widened her eyes. \u201cIt\u2026 it was this, uh, v-visual novel adaptation! Yeah. Two former lovers, torn apart by bad decisions and their own inability to let love reach their hearts, finally realize what they mean to each other and race back towards each other\u2019s arms as the music swells and the sakura leaves fall and it\u2019s super, ultra heartwarming and it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Stella brought the fingertips of her right hand up to her lips and, pinching all her digits together, kissed them, and dramatically tossed the metaphorical kiss away from her face. \u201cSo cathartic and perfect that it still brings tears to my eyes!\u201d\n\n   With a deadpan look on her face, Rosa raised an eyebrow. Stella, in turn, only kept a toothy smile on her lips. A few droplets of sweat formed on her brow as she struggled to keep smiling despite her mood being in no such disposition.  \n\n   Two seconds later, Rosa also put on a warm smile on her lips. \u201c\u00a1Hey! Mientras te haga feliz, \u00a1yo soy feliz!\u201d she cheered, turning away from her friend and undoing her seatbelt. \n\n   Stella let out a sigh. \u2018Sorry for the lie, Rosa, but I don\u2019t think remembering the past would be a good way to start your morning,\" She thought, all the while doing her best to keep the forced smile on her lips. \"You have enough to worry as is with the business and stuff.\u2019 She looked down at the spot on the back of her hand where the now dry tears had been. \u2018Besides, I'm being too sentimental about the past. Not like being sentimental's going to change anything about it...\u2019\n\n   A part of Stella wished it could do. \n\nRosa shut off her van\u2019s engine and turned to face her friend. \u201cLista?\u201d she asked in an enthusiastic tone.\n\n     The lime-toned dino hesitated for a second. Her previous thoughts still lingered in the forefront of her mind. It made pumping the brakes on her train of thoughts harder. Rather than risk some mental derailment, she redirected her perception towards thinking of the day yet to come.\n\n   Stella gave her friend a toothy grin. \u201c\u2018Course!\u201d she answered as she unbuckled her seatbelt and stepped out of the van. Rosa followed not long after. The two friends grabbed their water bottles and shut their respective doors. Only when the two were standing out of the van did Rosa press a button on her car\u2019s remote. With a cheerful chirp, the van's doors locked with loud mechanical clicks. \n\n   Stella went over her workout outfit, hoping she hadn\u2019t overdressed like last time. She had gotten her tracksuit on sale one week earlier, and only because it was the same style and color tracksuit that Subaru Natsuki from Re-Zero wore. Re-Zero was the ONLY Isekai show that she actually liked, the rest being hot garbage. She hadn\u2019t bothered to premiere the outfit outside of checking that it fit her well. She almost would have forgotten about it had it not been for Rosa suggesting they go jogging on the beach at dawn. \n\n   A part of Stella wondered why Rosa had decided to do a pre-sunrise jog at the beach. Their workouts at the gym already worked pretty well for them. 'Maybe Rosa wants to try something new?\" Stella pondered as her eyes scanned the still darkened horizon. 'Like some kind of wish that she hadn\u2019t been able to indulge until today?' \n\n   Whatever the case was, Stella was happy that she had a sturdy and warm tracksuit with which to jog that morning. Sure, it was a bit warm for summertime, but it would more than suffice once winter rolled around. \n\n   \u2018I wonder\u2026\u2019 Stella thought as she turned to look at her ass. Sure enough, the pants did her no favors in hiding her wide hips. Hips that only seemed to grow wider with the passing years. \n\n   Stella felt her cheeks warm up a few degrees as she remembered why she hadn\u2019t used the outfit until today. If she wore that outfit in public, she was sure every male eye within a hundred-mile radius would lock on her.\n\n   To try and get her mind off her little dilemma, Stella set her gaze on Rosa\u2019s outfit. \n\n   In some way, Rosa\u2019s workout gear is the polar opposite of Stella\u2019s. Unlike the thick jacket the stegosaur wore, Rosa sported a very light and very red cotton tank top that didn\u2019t even go all the way down to her waist, leaving at least a hand\u2019s worth of open space in which the ankylosaur\u2019s orange belly was visible. Her light gray pants were also on the thin side, being something of a cross between joggers and yoga pants. Unlike Stella\u2019s pants, Rosa\u2019s pants fit her frame so well they neither increased nor decreased the size of her hips. On top of that, the outfit had an intricate set of floral patterns, gray on the shirt, and red on the pants. Stella couldn\u2019t be sure, but something told her that the two garments were matching pieces, even if they didn\u2019t look at them. It made her a bit jealous. It was a really nice ensemble.\n\n   Rosa took a deep breath of air and let out a chuckle. \u201c\u00a1Ah, que gloriosa es esta amanecer!\u201d She inhaled again, only this time wholly through her nose, the smile on her lips only growing wider by the second. \n\n   Stella envied Rosa when it came to her olfactory prowess. She had always had the stronger sense of smell of the two on account of all her years tending to flowers. If what she said was true, botany was an old family tradition dating back at least five generations and two continents. She also didn\u2019t suffer from any pollen problems, like allergies. Likely a perk of her family\u2019s long botanical traditions.\n\n   \u201cBien!\u201d Rosa said as she pulled out her phone and readied her jogging log up. \u201cWe have about an hour before full sunrise. Let\u2019s try and do four miles in that time. Sound good?\u201d\n\n   Stella pulled her own jogging app and also set her goal and pace on it. \u201cOui! C'est parti pour cette course!\u201d she cheered in her native French without hesitation.\n\n   Rosa guffawed at her friend\u2019s use of her family\u2019s native language. Not many knew that Stella's family had come from France. She had been born in Volcadera Bluffs, but she spoke French very well. It reminded the ankylosaur of her own family, and how despite also being born in Volcadera Bluffs, she spoke Spanish almost as well as her native parent.\n\n   Without further words or interruptions from either of them, Rosa and Stella set off jogging. At first, they tried keeping to the paved road snaking along the beach. Soon, they entered the sandy beach itself, their footing becoming uneven in the sand. The extra work needed to maintain balance added to the workout, their combined footfalls muffled by the sand, yet still almost in pace with one another.\n\n   Steadily, the two approached the first big landmark on their journey: a set of concrete benches erected to help beachgoers get some sand-free seating. The benches were plain. Aside from a bit of sun bleaching and some harmless graffiti, they were the definition of mundane.\n\n   That was, except for the black form resting next to the benches. What looked like a body, sprawled out on the sand and almost dead looking...\n\n   Rosa and Stella stopped in their tracks and turned to look at each other. A second of contemplation later, the two anxiously approached the body. Neither of the two girls wanted to say anything, but their growing fear was impossible to deny.\n\n   Rosa is the first to show any emotion other than shock. She lets out a shriek and takes a step away from the body. \u201cS-Stella!\u201d she stammers, her eyes falling on her friend as she points a finger at the body by the benches. \u201cEse h-humano e-esta\u2026 esta\u2026\u201d she takes a deep breath and loses any semblance of composure she had. \u201c\u00a1Esta muerto! \u00a1Esta muerto!\u201d the orange dino screeched all the while frantically running in place. \n\n   Stella froze and swallowed hard. Unlike Rosa\u2019s understandable and warranted freakout, she didn\u2019t panic. At least physically. Even as a part of her brain told her to lose stability and give in to terror, she kept a coolheadedness that betrayed her actual emotions. Years of playing the aloof and mysterious fortune teller may not have helped her make many friends... but it had helped her develop control over her immediate reactions.\n\n   Rosa looked to her friend with concern and fear still etched all over her expression. While still keeping a face full of anxiety, she took some cues from Stella\u2019s calmness\u2014feigned as it might have been\u2014and began calming herself. There was still a sickness in her stomach though. It made her want nothing more than to turn right back around and leave.\n\n   Stella, looking between Rosa and herself, inhaled as much as her lungs would hold and stepped forward.\n\n   On seeing her friend move ahead, Rosa reaches out to Stella and grabs her by the right arm. She says not a word, only shaking her head and giving the lime dino a supplicating gaze.\n\n   Despite her trepidation, Stella eased out of her friend\u2019s grip and stepped closer to the body. As she did, she couldn't help but feel unusual by how calm she felt in the face of literal demise. Perhaps years of dabbling in such occult things as Tarot cards and Ouiji boards had made her apathetic to death? Or maybe all the people back in High School had been right and she was just weird.\n\n   Rosa made a sound behind Stella somewhere between an \u2018eep\u2019 and a whine. Even though she didn't turn around to look, Stella could tell that Rosa had taken a few more steps back in fear. Fear of what, she wasn\u2019t clear on though. \u2018Maybe she thinks this is like the start of a zombie story, like with Highschool of the Dead?\u2019 Stella mused as she continued to approach the body. She of course knew that it was complete nonsense to believe in zombies. Yet, there was always a minuscule chance that she could be wrong. That the instant she got within reach, the body would spring to life and bite her, turning her into a member of the great skeleton army.\n\n   Stella shook her head to get the errant thoughts of zombies out of her head. The only thing that mattered was that there was a body lying on the beach. Neither Rosa nor herself even knew if the human was actually dead. It was hard to tell considering the body was face down.\n\n   The first thing she needed to do was to check.\n\n   The lime stegosaur gingerly closed the remaining distance between herself and the body. Hesitating for only a second, she crouched next to the human and placed her right hand on their back. With one last look back towards Rosa\u2014who still looked like she was ready to take off running at the first sign of danger\u2014she flipped the human face up.\n\n   The first thing Stella's eyes noticed about the human, aside from his gender, were the many bruises and scrapes on his face. As she inspected the human closer, she also spotted a nasty gash on his forehead. The blood was dry, which meant the injury happened hours earlier. Next, she noticed the human's getup. He wore a plain black long sleeve turtleneck and a pair of navy blue jogging pants, as well as a black wool beanie.\n\n   With a bit of doubt given the circumstances, Stella moved her hand towards the human\u2019s chest. At first, she felt neither heartbeat nor lung movement. That changed when a second later, she sensed a very faint heartbeat. She let out a sigh of relief and turned around to face Rosa. \u201cHe\u2019s alive!\u201d\n\n   Rosa, on hearing Stella\u2019s words, exhaled the air she hadn\u2019t even noticed she\u2019d been holding in to for the last minute. After once again collecting herself, the orange dino made a flurry of movements with her right hand. First, she made a cross sign with her index and thumb. Next, she brought up the small cross up to her forehead, then moved to her lower stomach next, and finally both shoulders, starting with her left, and then moving to the right. Finally, she finished by kissing the cross sign and looking up to the heavens with a wide rapturous smile. \u201c\u00a1Oh, gracias Raptor Jes\u00fas!\u201d\n\n   Stella, also feeling relief, decided to take a closer look at the human\u2019s face. She didn\u2019t know many of them, but something about the injured man before her struck her as... familiar. Something about his lack of features that, ironically, made her think of a human she had known years ago... \n\n   \u2018But that can\u2019t be,\u2019 Stella thought as she continued staring into the human\u2019s battered face. \u2018He disappeared almost four years ago\u2026\u2019 \n\n   The lime dino's eyes fell on the human\u2019s beanie. \"There's only one way to find out for sure\u2026\" she whispered as she reached for the human\u2019s beanie. With a single pull, she removed the hat, revealing to the world a shiny bald head, nary a single hair.\n\n   Stella almost tripped backward at the sight. Rosa, noticing her friend\u2019s sudden change in disposition, rushed forward to provide support. She was about to ask her companion what had so shocked her when her eyes too fell upon the human\u2019s face. \n\n   The moment the ankylosaur\u2019s eyes took in the sight of her, she too felt weak on the knees. A strange and powerful mixture of nostalgia and melancholy began coursing through her as the full weight of recognition hit her like a runaway popemobile.\n\n   \u201c\u00a1No lo creo!\u201d Rosa shouted before almost kneeling next to her friend. \u201cS-Stella\u2026 is it... really him!?\u201d she stammered her question.\n\n   Stella looked between her friend and the human a couple more times before the full weight of what she was seeing also sunk in. In the end, there was no other human in town\u2014possibly the world\u2014who had such plain, almost nonexistent features yet had still caused such a large impact on their lives\u2026\n\n   \u201cIt\u2019s Anon...\u201d Stella whispered\n\n   \u201cIt\u2019s An-On!\u201d Rosa shouted.\n\n   Rosa and Stella stayed in shock for a few seconds before Stella broke the silence. \u201cWhat\u2026 what do you think happened to Anon?\u201d she asked, her voice barely holding coherence.\n\n   Rosa looked over the human and grimaced. \u201cLooks like An-On got beat up and got left for muerto.\u201d She lets out a snort, her face twisting into a scowl of rage, her very orange skin turning a deep shade of hot crimson. \u201c\u00a1\u00a1SI ENCUENTRO A LOS PENDEJOS QUE MALMATARON A AN-ON, LO JURO POR RAPTOR JESUS Y DIOS TODO SANTO QUE LES VOY HACER LLOVER FUEGO, FURIA, Y AZUFRE EN SUS CULOS!!\u201d\n\n   Stella swallowed hard again. As a pious follower of the holy cave paintings, Rosa\u2019s whole MO when it came to grievances and affronts to her sensibilities was to turn the other cheek. Her disappointment in you was often more than enough to make even the most hardened offender beg her for forgiveness. To see Rosa be livid enough to threaten fire and brimstone was nothing short of apocalyptic\u2026\n\n   Rosa continued breathing hard for a few more seconds. Each puff of air that left her nostrils was steam. After a minute of barely restrained rage, the dino closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Five seconds of seeming introspective self-calming later, Rosa turned to face Stella. Her expression had shifted from one of rage to one of apprehension. \u201cWe gotta wake An-On,\u201d she proposed to Stella. \n\n   For her part, Stella wholeheartedly agreed with Rosa. The question was, how did they go about rousing a beaten human back into consciousness? What if they did something wrong in the attempt? The idea of causing Anon more harm than he already had suffered wasn\u2019t appealing to either of them. Especially since they hadn\u2019t seen him in nearly four years. Humans could change a lot in that timeframe. Who was to say that Anon had a whole different range of physical functions?\n\n   \u201cUh, Rosa,\u201d Stella started, her hands already withdrawn from Anon\u2019s vicinity. \u201cI think this is beyond us. Maybe we should\u2026 try and get professional help?\u201d\n\n   After a few seconds of contemplation, Rosa let out a sigh and a nod of acceptance. \u201c\u00a1Quedate aqui! I\u2019ll bring the van around and\u2026\u201d she paused, giving Anon another worried glance. \u201c...We\u2019ll drive An-On to the hospital. I\u2019m sure they can help him there...\u201d\n\n   Stella gave Rosa a nod, Rosa taking that as her cue to stand back up and rush back in the direction the two had come in one of her fastest sprints ever. Stella found it a bit surprising to see her friend burn rubber as she was. Then again, the life of an old friend was on the line. If that fact didn\u2019t make someone move faster than they had before, then they weren\u2019t exactly a friend.\n\n   With Rosa gone, Stella looked westward towards the rising sun. She didn\u2019t quite know what to make of the unfolding situation. One thing was certain to her though\u2026\n\n   Anon's entrance into Volcano High and into their lives had once caused everyone\u2019s story to change dramatically. Maybe his return was also a sign that great change was coming? \n\n   Whether that change was good or bad was still anyone's guess\u2026\n\nThe big hand on the clock ticked over to the four. Somewhere in the sterile white hospital room, the sound of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\u2019s main theme, \u2018Sorairo Days,\u2019 snapped Stella awake. The lime stegosaur let out a yawn, stretched the soreness on her neck away, wiped her clear, and looked down at the phone\u2019s screen. A picture of Rosa was glowing back at her. Groggily, she pressed the answer button and placed the phone to her ear. \u201cH-hello.\u201d\n\n   \u201cHey Stella. Como estas?\u201d\n\n   It took Stella a few seconds to translate her friend\u2019s Spanish in her head before answering. \u201cI\u2019m good. Fell asleep though.\u201d\n\n   \u201cI\u2019m guessing An-On\u2019s not woken up yet?\u201d\n\n   Stella turned her eyes towards the bed to her right. Lying there, with an IV bag attached to his arm and wrapped in bandages was Anon wearing a white polka-dotted hospital gown.\n\n   \u201cNo. Still out cold.\u201d\n\n   \u201cDid the doctors tell you anything about what happened\u2026?\u201d There was a pause, though Stella could almost hear Rosa\u2019s hands clench into a white-knuckled fist. \u201c...And who beat him up?\u201d\n\n   Stella thought back to what the doctor had told her\u2026\n\n   *\u201cYour friend there suffered a major concussion, I'm afraid. He also suffered minor fractures on his cheekbones and forehead. We also found shockingly high levels of alcohol and cannabis on his system. I\u2019m shocked he didn\u2019t overdose. Unfortunately, it's still too early to know if all that bad stuff in his system will result in permanent damage\u2026\u201d*\n\n   Stella sighed. \u201cStill no word on who beat Anon up. The only thing the doc told me is that he suffered an... what did he say\u2026 oh, a \u2018major concussion.\u2019 He was also jacked up with so much alcohol and weed that\u2026 well\u2026 he was REALLY jacked up on the stuff. At the same time, too.\u201d\n\n   Stella could hear a gasp from the other end. Her mind played an image of Rosa doing another sign of the cross before her friend spoke again. \u201c\u00a1Santa Madre del Raptor Jes\u00fas! Is he going to die!?\u201d\n\n   Stella sat up straight on hearing her friend\u2019s words. \u201cNo!\u201d she almost shouted before clearing her throat. \u201cI-I mean, Anon\u2019s not dying! He\u2019s stable\u2026 just... really, REALLY hurt....\u201d She thought about the last few words the doctor had told her about Anon\u2019s possible brain health. She considered telling Rosa that last part, but in the end, decided against it. The last thing she wanted was for Rosa to feint from worry.\n\n   \u201cDid the doctor say when An-On\u2019s going to wake up!?\u201d\n\n   \u201cNo. Not really\u2026\u201d\n\n   There was another moment of silence before Rosa once again spoke. \u201cI\u2019m going to close shop early for the day. I\u2019ll be there in three hours.\u201d\n\n   \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Stella asked, the full weight of the events now playing before her sinking in. \u2018Rosa\u2019s never once closed early or taken a vacation\u2026\u2019\n\n   \u201cAn-On needs help, and I doubt anyone else in this town\u2019s going to help him. Especially considering what happened between him and the others.\u201d\n\n   Stella was about to say something, but she only nodded in agreement despite being on the phone.\n\n   \u201cHang in there for a few more hours, Stella. I\u2019ll take over when I get there and you can go get some real rest.\u201d\n\n   \u201cThanks,\u201d Stella said, a warm smile forming on her lips. \n\n   There was a crashing sound from Rosa\u2019s end. What almost sounded like the shattering of a vase. \u201cMaldita sea. Gotta go! A customer\u2019s kid toppled over some flowers and spilled water everywhere. \u00a1Te veo al rato!\u201d Rosa said before shouting something she couldn\u2019t quite catch in her native Spanish. Seconds later, the call dropped. Stella was once more left with a still unconscious Anon by her side.\n\n   Stella put away her phone and stood up to stretch. She had been Sitting for almost nine hours now. Though she hated to admit it, doing nothing but waiting for Anon to do anything other than lay on the bed like a vegetable irked her. Compared to her daily work routine, her current situation couldn\u2019t get any more boring. At the same time, the reason she was even in a hospital was because of Anon\u2019s sudden and violent reappearance. \n\n   As Stella\u2019s eyes fell on Anon\u2019s battered face, the dino couldn\u2019t help but wonder what the human had been up to for the last four years. He, alongside Fang, stopped going to school after prom night. They had ditched prom itself too, which should have been the first red flag for everyone. Talking to Naser had revealed very little aside from the news that Fang had broken up with Anon and had wound up in a bad place. Stella and Rosa believed\u2014or maybe they convinced themselves\u2014that Fang and Anon only needed time to work through the break-up. That they would return to school once they got over the depression. None of them could have known at the time how far-reaching the problem was.\n\n   When a week passed by with Fang still locked in her room, Naser tried taking matters into his own hands. He talked to Trish and Reed. Trish refused to talk about what happened between herself and Fang. Only when she wasn\u2019t around did Reed tell Naser that Fang had broken off her friendship with them. \n\n   With that venue dead, Naser then searched for any trace of Anon. Despite looking for the human high and low, he found no trace of him anywhere. He almost got his father involved at one point. But he realized that doing that would mean setting his very angry father on the person who had hurt his daughter. That would have not been survivable for Anon. \n\n   In the end, Naser gave up and tried to get Fang to return to school\u2026 only to discover that she had run away the night prior. She left no note and nothing to track her with.\n\n   Stella sighed again and plopped back into the couch next to Anon\u2019s bed. As she did, she eyed Anon up and down, taking in all his visible physical aspects in an attempt to piece together some kind of past that would explain the human\u2019s four year absence.\n\n   Stella stared with Anon\u2019s face first. The bandages made it hard to see much skin, but what was visible looked rough. There was a certain tan coloration to it, almost as if Anon had been getting a huge amount of daily sunlight exposure. Going down his neck, she noted a little bit of dryness to his skin. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of the alcohol-induced dehydration, or if it was because of Anon\u2019s last four years somewhere other than Volcaldera Bluffs. Moving to his chest, she noticed that it was far, far bulkier than she recalled in High School. The Anon from High School was scrawny. Not a stick by any means, but certainly lacking in the musculature this Anon had. The arms attached to the chest were also bulked. In some ways, they reminded her of Rosa\u2019s arms, which were naturally heavy thanks to all her garden work.\n\n   Curious and maybe a bit drawn by the muscles on display, Stella inched a finger forward and poked Anon\u2019s right arm. The instant she did, she felt a huge level of resistance, the arms holding almost no flabbiness to them. Stella poked the arm again, this time holding her finger down on the bicep. As she pressed down, she felt the strands of muscle underneath contract, further increasing the arm\u2019s hardness. Having already gone that far, the dino decided to wrap her hand around the human\u2019s bicep. It was then she felt the full level of volume in Anon\u2019s arms. As she withdrew her hand, she couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly warm around the face, her heart racing a bit faster than before. She could hardly believe just how beefed Anon felt. He was almost beefier than the jock she had somehow managed to ask out to prom.\n\n   The discovery of such muscles gave Stella pause. Anon had to have been doing something physically demanding if he had gone from a scrawny guy who could barely pull weeds, to now feeling like he could lift several hundred pounds with one arm. As she inspected Anon\u2019s arm closer, he spotted something that she had somehow missed. She inched closer to get a better look, at which point the shape of an anchor came into her view.\n\n   Stella blinked a few times, unsure of how she had missed such an obvious tattoo. Thinking fast, she reached for her phone and looked online for what an anchor tattoo could mean. Less than two minutes later, she had found a page detailing the exact meanings of sailor tattoos. She only needed to take one look at similar tattoos in the arms of other sailors to put two and two together.\n\n   \u2018The dry, tanned skin, the well-toned muscles, and the anchor tattoo...' Stella shut off her phone and once again sat back down on the couch. As she did, the full weight of her discovery hit her like the fist of one of the Getter Emperor. She again looked to Anon, this time with amazement. Of all the people she had ever met in her time at Volcano High, she had never once imagined Anon as someone to join the Navy. \u2018Though, now that I think about it, it would explain his sudden disappearance...' Stella thought. If she had to take a guess as to what happened after prom... \n\n   \u2018So Fang and Anon break up. The two fall into a deep depression. Anon stops going to school. Probably drops out. Fang also drops out and runs away from home. Anon then joins the navy because he either didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go or wanted to vanish. Spends the next four years on a boat crossing the pacific, hence his tattoo. Got buff and probably did a lot of cool navy stuff. Gets released after his service and comes back to Volcadera Bluffs four years later and then... gets beat up on the beach...?\u2019\n\n   Stella shook her head and started rubbing her chin. \u2018It doesn\u2019t make any sense. None of it does!\u2019 she thought with growing frustration. Anon became a sailor. Sailors were tough. Anon, being a sailor, was tough too. \u2018I mean, the muscles on him are pretty hard to deny,\u2019 she mused, again feeling warm around her cheeks. She changed her mental tracks and returned to her previous ponderings. \u2018Whoever beat him up had to be tougher than he was. Then again, the doctor also said that he was super drunk and super high at the same time. With his senses impaired, it makes a bit more sense that someone would be able to jump him. What would anyone gain from beating up a sailor though?\u2019 The dino brought her hands up to the temples of her head and looked to Anon with a growing grimace. \u201cOh Anon, why won\u2019t you wake up and tell me what happened to you!?\u201d the lime dino groaned as she again collapsed on the couch.\n\n   With a sigh of defeat, Stella looked up at the clock on the wall. The minute hand had only moved thirty whole minutes. As she narrowed her eyes, the minute hand moved forward one space. That caused the stegosaur to drop back her head in defeat. She considered for a second putting on an anime on her phone to pass the time, but one side glance towards Anon killed that plan. Not because she didn\u2019t think it was in poor taste to watch something fun and entertaining next to a man who may or may not be braindead, but rather because she would have much preferred to share that show with that man. If Anon was suffering, then she too deserved to suffer. If nothing else because she had helped to lead Anon down the road that led to his current unconsciousness.\n\n   With grim determination in her heart, Stella pulled out her phone and logged into her Rocktube account. With some hesitation, she navigated towards a playlist titled \u2018Only play this if you want to feel absolutely, UNEQUIVOCALLY terrible.' She moved to tap on the list, but her finger hung a few centimeters away from the screen. Some subconscious part of her brain was forcing her hand to freeze in place. She glared at her hand before putting the rest of her willpower into moving that finger. At last, though, she got the result she wanted and managed to tap on the playlist. With a click, a sixty-video long list of the most terrible anime openings ever put to both screen and music loaded up.\n\n   The first song on the list, titled \u2018Gundoh Mushashi OP\u2019 began playing. Within the first few seconds, Stella felt a jolt run down her spine, down her legs, and right into her tail. She had heard buzzsaws carry a better tune. She could almost feel the blood pouring out from her ears as the song played for an agonizingly long one minute and thirty seconds. When that song at last ended, the next song on the list, \u2018Spiral OP\u2019 began playing. The female singer\u2019s high-pitched voice combined with what sounded like an unfiltered drum played through a broken speaker followed. The two sounds combined so horribly that Stella was certain that VVRUM DRAMA back when they were still using two bases could have done a much better job playing the song. When that at last ended, a song titled \u2018Kill Me Baby\u2019 played its uneven, chaotic melody. The singers obviously did very little in the way of caring aside from getting a paycheck, something that made Stella grind her teeth in rage.\n\n   Stella was doing her best to hold together and not turn off her phone in disgust. \u2018Suffering tempers the soul,' she told herself as another horrible OP, this one titled \u2018Hentai!\u2019 of all things, played. As the absurd lyrics talking about all kinds of lewd things and the less than subpar animation performed before her, the lime stego actually began to envy Anon. For in his inability to listen to such horrible music, he was in true bliss...\n\n   ...That was until Anon\u2019s hand very suddenly dropped on top of Stella\u2019s phone, pausing the video and bringing about ecstatic silence once again.\n\n   '...Wait a sec...' Stella thought as her eyes fell on Anon's arm.\n\n   Stella let out a sharp scream as she recoiled from the surprise. Anon, meanwhile, glared daggers at the dino, his eyes sunken yet glowing with absolute fury; like at that very second, he wanted nothing more than to wrap his hands around Stella\u2019s neck and wring the life right out of her for even thinking about playing such foul abominations of the melodic arts.\n\n   \u201cYour\u2026 taste\u2026 in... OP\u2019s\u2026 is absolute\u2026 dog shit\u2026 St-Stella...\u201d Anon hissed through clenched teeth, his hand shaking as he struggled to keep it placed over the screen.\n\n   Shock soon gave way to surprise, which then gave way to confusion, which then gave way to relief and joy, all within the span of less than a second. \u201cANON!\u201d Stella shouted as she tossed herself on Anon, wrapping her arms around the still weak human.\n\n   Anon, for his part, was utterly confused about what was going on. One moment, he had been lying in his flat feeling hotter than he\u2019d ever felt and getting drunker and higher than he\u2019d ever been. After that, he saw flashes of things he did. Running down a street, walking on the beach, punching himself in an attempt at self-punishment, smashing his own head against concrete... He couldn\u2019t recall more particular things than that. The only thing he knew was that his face and head both hurt like hell.\n\n   One of the nurses burst through the door a second after Stella had screamed. \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2014\u201d she cut off herself the instant she saw Anon\u2019s eyes fix themselves on her. \u201cHoly mother of\u2014\u201d she began but paused before turning around. \u201cGet the doctor! The patient\u2019s awake!\u201d she shouted as she walked into the room. Without a word, she motioned for Stella to relocate. Reluctantly, the lime stego moved as the nurse rushed next to Anon. Within the second, she checked his IV drip and the rest of his vitals, all the while adjusting the bed so that Anon could better lay on it without having to strain his back. \n\n   Less than a minute later, the doctor rushed into the room, his eyes falling on Anon with a mixture of surprise and delight. He walked up to Anon\u2019s bed and gave his nurse a nod. \u201cThank you so very much. I\u2019ll take this here case from here.\u201d \n\n   With a respectful nod, the nurse left the room, leaving only Anon, the doctor, and Stella.\n\n   \u201cWell, color me surprised, but you had us scared for almost nine hours now. Glad to see you awake, uh\u2026 Anon, was it?\u201d\n\n   Anon gave the doctor a nod before bringing a hand to his head. The instant he touched one of the bandages, he retracted his limb with a hiss of pain.\n\n   \u201cWoah. Easy now!\u201d the doctor said, stepping closer to anon and gently patting him on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re still very tender. In fact, I\u2019m shocked you\u2019re even awake at all!\u201d\n\n   Anon blinked a few times, his eyes traveling between Stella and the doctor. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, his voice still raspy and weak.\n\n   \u201cWell, for starters, someone beat the living tar out of you. Secondly, you were so loaded on alcohol and cannabis that I\u2019m shocked you didn\u2019t give up the ghost then and there. Finally, you took such a hard knock on that there nogging of yours that I\u2019m astonished you\u2019re even aware right now!\u201d He grabbed a clipboard from the front of the bed and began writing down on it. \u201cYes sir. You, my homo-sapien amigo, are very lucky that this here young lady found you when she did. Had you stayed on that beach after sunrise, you would have died not just from all those there injuries, but dehydration too.\u201d The doctor turned to look at Stella. \u201cWhat was your name again, miss?\u201d\n\n   \u201cS-Stella,\u201d the stegosaur stammered.\n\n   \u201cWell, Miss Stella and Mr. Anon. Vitals are looking good. The only thing left now is observation.\u201d The doctor finished writing on the clipboard and set his eyes on Anon. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep you overnight and see if any complications arise. If nothing seems to be going south, then we should be able to let you go tomorrow morning. I suggest you get yourself some grub, catch up with your friend here, and get yourself some rest.\u201d The doctor placed the clipboard back on the bed\u2019s front. \u201cOh, and don\u2019t worry about any medical expenses. Half of it's covered by your GI benefits. The other by a family member of yours.\u201d The doctor let out a well-meaning chuckle. \u201cI really do love it when family sticks together.\u201d\n\n   As the doctor left the room, Anon couldn\u2019t help but wonder who this \u2018family\u2019 the doctor had told him about was. Last he checked, his own parents had written him off for dead. It couldn\u2019t be any of his Navy comrades either. He never got along with any of them beyond the whole team building bull. He had no other people on earth that could claim to care about him either\u2026\n\n   Anon\u2019s head began throbbing, and he took that as a sign that he needed to stop thinking. He lay his head back on the now angled bed and turned to look at Stella, who for some reason was wearing what looked like a very familiar tracksuit. He blinked a few times and let out a dry laugh. \u201cWhy\u2026 are you\u2026 wearing... Subaru\u2026 Natsuki\u2019s... tracksuit?\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s eyes lit up like they were Christmas decorations. \u201cY-you can tell!?\u201d she almost shouted, her tail instinctively wrapping around her leg.\n\n   Anon sighed and turned away from the stegosaur. \u201cFour\u2026 years. I don\u2019t\u2026 fucking see you\u2026 for four\u2026 years\u2026 and you\u2019re still\u2026 the same\u2026 weeb\u2026\u201d He let out another dry chuckle as he closed his eyes. \u201cPeople\u2026 never\u2026 change\u2026\u201d he whispered bitterly.\n\n   Stella tilted her head to the side, not sure what to make of Anon's comment. Not that it mattered anyway, as her previous excitement returned in full force as she rushed back to Anon\u2019s bedside, eyes once more aglow with barely-contained glee. \u201cSo, did you watch any good shows while in the navy!?\u201d Stella asked with almost child-like energy.\n\n   Anon turned back to look at Stella\u2019s eyes. At first, he felt tempted to make a snide remark about growing up. That thought fell away as a question formed on his lips instead. \u201cHow\u2026 did you know\u2026 I was in the\u2026 navy?\u201d\n\n   \u201cYour anchor tattoo!\u201d Stella answered, pointing at Anon\u2019s right arm. \u201cAlso... your new musculature\u2026\u201d she bashfully said as she tapped her fingers together and looked down at her feet.\n\n   Anon let some air out of his nose. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d he started, his eyes once again falling on Stella\u2019s light blue eyes. \u201cWhy did\u2026 you\u2026 save me\u2026?\u201d\n\n   Stella again tilted her head in confusion. \u201cWhy did I save you?\u201d she repeated the question with some incredulity. \u201cWhy WOULDN\u2019T I save an old friend!\u201d she answered with such sickening sweetness that Anon couldn\u2019t help but feel that one in his heart. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in four years. NO ONE has. We\u2026 we all thought you had died, Anon. DIED!\u201d   \n\n   Anon\u2019s face turned into a grimace at Stella\u2019s words. \u201cI might... as well... have died...\u201d he whispered. \n\n   Stella gasped, a grimace forming on her face. \u201cWhy would you say something as awful as that!\u201d she almost shouted in rage.\n\n   Anon opened his eyes as wide as he could and stared right into Stella\u2019s soul. \u201cI have... nothing... to impart on to you. I straight fucked it\u2026 this life\u2026\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s tail dropped along with her mood. \u201cI guess you haven\u2019t exactly had the best four years of your life, huh?\u201d\n\n   Anon didn\u2019t even dignify Stella with an answer, only continuing to give the lime dino a soul-piercing glare.\n\n   Stella stood up straight and put on a determined face. \u201cAnon, listen to me and listen well. Just because you feel like you\u2019ve screwed your life beyond repair doesn\u2019t mean you actually have. You\u2019re still here and are still alive, aren\u2019t you?!\u201d\n\n   Anon opened his mouth to speak, but he promptly shut it when Stella once again moved forward, her face only inches away from his.\n\n   \u201cAs long as we are alive, we can work towards a better tomorrow. So what if we suffer along the way? So what if we stumble and fall? We have to get back up and keep moving ahead!\u201d\n\n   \u201cI don\u2019t... think I\u2019m capable of that\u2026\u201d Anon whispered, his eyes shifting away from Stella's own soul-piercing stare. \u201cI\u2026 I have committed horrible sins\u2026 and I hate myself for it\u2026\u201d He bit his own lip and turned to look at Stella, yes shimmering. \u201cI fucked up so, so bad!\u201d the human shouted, his voice still coarse, but his tone uninterrupted and heartfelt. \u201cI ran away when I should\u2019ve faced the consequences of my actions. I tried to numb the pain with booze and weed and apathy. I\u2026 I had a chance to start over\u2026 and I still chose to be apathetic!\u201d The human took an uneven, wavering breath as he again looked away from Stella. \u201cI\u2026 I think I even tried to kill myself last night\u2026 which is why I\u2019m this fucked mess of a man\u2026\u201d He closed his eyes, a tear flowing from his right eye. \u201cPeople don\u2019t change, Stella. I haven\u2019t changed\u2026 I don't believe in myself anymore\u2026\u201d\n\n   Anon opened his eyes to both clear the tears and to see Stella\u2019s face of devastation over his words. Instead, he opened his eyes to see a lime-toned stegosaur with the most outraged expression he had ever seen. While her eyes shimmered also, her cheeks had turned a deep crimson, the heat radiating from them almost overwhelming to the human.\n\n   Before Anon had a chance to say or do anything, Stella placed a foot upon his bedside and crossed her arms, holding her head up high, all the while still looking deep into Anon\u2019s eyes. \n\n   \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in yourself, then that\u2019s fine!\u201d Stella started in a boomy voice that Anon had never heard from her. \u201cDon\u2019t believe in yourself, Anon!\u201d she thundered, all the while pointing her right index finger at Anon. \n\n   It was now Anon\u2019s turn to tilt his head to the side. \u201c...What...?\u201d he asked, unsure of what to make of Stella\u2019s words.\n\n   \u201cDon't believe in the me that believes in you, and DON\u2019T believe in the you that believes in me. Instead, believe in yourself who believes in you!\u201d Stella again leaned towards Anon, a wide and confident ear to ear smile on her lips. \u201cDon't get distracted by the what-if's, should-have's, and if-only's. The one thing you choose for yourself\u2026 that is the truth of your universe!\u201d she ended, once again crossing her arms for emphasis.\n\n   There was silence in the room for almost half a minute. In that time, Stella still pointed her finger at Anon, all the while holding one leg up and striking her crossed arms pose.\n\n   Anon, meanwhile, was trying\u2014and failing\u2014to make sense of Stella\u2019s words. Despite his throbbing headache, he did force himself to try and make some semblance of reason when it came to Stella\u2019s motivational speech. Only when he ran the words over his head for the tenth time did he recognize that the words didn\u2019t belong to Stella at all.\n\n   Anon narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou... stole that from Kamina... didn\u2019t you\u2026?\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s reaction to Anon\u2019s discovery was twofold. First, Stella lost all composure and nearly fell on her rear. The only thing that kept her upright was her tail. Next was her putting on a goofy little simper. Finally, the stego gave Anon another wide-eyed and glowy stare, as if trying to divert his attention.\n\n   Try as he did, Anon couldn\u2019t help but find Stella's stare adorable...\n\n   Anon sighed and rolled his eyes. \u201cYou know that quote only works if the person I\u2019m going to believe in is strong and full of hot-blooded spirit, right?\u201d\n\n   Stella finally let go of her pose and moved next to Anon again, once again taking on a more conservative posture. \u201cAm I not someone you can put your full unquestioning trust in?\u201d Stella asked with a bit of disappointment in her voice.\n\n   Anon shook his head and let out a soft chuckle. \u201cHonestly, no.\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s expression soured a bit as she again looked down at the floor.\n\n   \u201cHowever,\u201d Anon added, his words snapping Stella from her low. \u201cI\u2026 think I get what you were trying to tell me\u2026\u201d The human looked at his hand, which he clenched into a fist. \u201cI can\u2019t keep living in the past and beating myself over mistakes that I already made. I have to learn from those mistakes and face the future. Have to man the fuck up and set right what I so stupidly set wrong in the first place.\u201d\n\n   \u201cNot just you...\u201d Stella interrupted meekly. \u201cI\u2019m also responsible.\u201d\n\n   Anon narrowed his eyes. \u201cHow the fuck are you responsible? You were at prom enjoying yourself while I went and fucked everything up with Fang.\u201d\n\n   Stella sighed and reached into the purse next to the sofa. She pulled out a deck of tarot cards, one Anon was very familiar with.\n\n   \u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to be fucking with me!\u201d Anon bemoaned as he raised his hands up in the air. \u201cTarot cards? That\u2019s your big \u2018mistake\u2019!?\u201d\n\n   \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. The day Fang and the others played at Dino Moe\u2019s I gave you a reading that\u2026 I... that I failed to explain\u2026\u201d\n\n   Anon rolled his eyes again. \u201cYeah, I remember. \u2018Inverted empress,\u2019 followed by some cryptic warning before you\u2026 fucked off to the bathroom.\u201d\n\n   Stella nodded, again sitting down on the couch. \u201cI pulled the card, but I neglected to tell you what it REALLY meant for you. Then, despite knowing of your confusion, I said nothing else because\u2026\u201d Stella closed her eyes and sighed. \u201c...Because I was afraid. Afraid that you would make fun of me. Afraid that you would do the opposite to prove me wrong. Afraid to...\" the dino's whole body trembled as she pushed past some self-imposed inhibitor. \"... Afraid to realize that I WANTED to help you\u2026 even though you never liked me as more than a friend. If I was even a friend to you at all\u2026\u201d She slammed the tarot deck on the nearby table and left it there, her face scrunching into a scowl of both pain and anguish. \u201cI so wanted you to like me back then. I\u2026 I mean, we were both weebs and outcasts. Why couldn\u2019t we help fill each other\u2019s loneliness too?\u201d She sobbed deeply. \u201cThe real reason I ran out on you that night was because a part of me wanted things to fall apart for you. If you\u2026 if you messed everything up with Fang... then you would have been all alone again. Then I could have found you, and we would have bonded and become happy together as fellow lovers of anime...\" She brought her hands up to her face, the damn finally breaking as the dino began to weep in the most heart-wrenching way imaginable.\n\n   Anon, despite his desire to keep a stoic expression, couldn\u2019t help but feel the same sadness that Stella did. His experience in Dead End had left him wary of ever showing that he loved something. It got to the point that he began vilifying the very idea of showing his passions to anyone, hiding it all away so that no one could ever use his passions to hurt him. When he had first met Stella, he immediately pegged her as someone to avoid and belittle, and all because she was more open about a love he felt he had to hide from the world. Yet when his true power level became known to all, she was, along with Fang and Rosa and Reed, all there to support him through it... \n\n   With a still shaky arm, Anon put his right hand on Stella\u2019s shoulder. As the lime dino turned to look him in the eye, he tried his best to put on a sympathetic smile for her. He had no words to tell her, but he hoped his expression\u2014as battered as it was\u2014would be enough to convey what he wanted to tell her; that even in his fucked, broken, and apathetic life, he didn\u2019t hate her. Maybe in some alternate universe, they could have been something more than friends. A happy pair of dweebs whose idea of romance was rewatching old mecha shows while planning out their next trip to an anime convention... \n\n   Stella grabbed Anon\u2019s hand with her own two hands and cuddled it. He felt a goosebump run up his arm and down his spine when he felt Stella's skin. He hadn\u2019t felt anything so soft in nearly four years.\n\n   The two friends stayed silent for another minute before Stella let Anon\u2019s hands go and once again picked up her Tarot deck. \u201cAnon\u2026 I know you don\u2019t believe in fortunes and stuff\u2026 but do you\u2026 do you want me to give you a quick reading? For old time\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\n   Anon hesitated for a second. He really didn't have the best memories when it came to Stella\u2019s fortune-telling. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t deny that she loved it, her flair for the occult being second to none. He also didn\u2019t want to upset her again, especially bearing each other's hearts to one another.\n\n   \u201cSure. I\u2019d\u2026 love to,\u201d Anon said in as neutral a tone as he could muster. His voice felt like it was about ready to give out from the previous strains.\n\n   With Anon\u2019s blessing, Stella shuffled the tarot deck several times over with a showy level of showmanship that he hadn\u2019t quite ever seen from the lime stegosaur. Seeing her twist the cards, shuffle and re-shuffle them, divide the two into piles that she then pulled and brought together was mesmerizing. \n\n   After about thirty seconds of shuffling, Stella held the deck out to anon. \u201cTake one,\u201d she told Anon. \n\n   With a still shaky hand and a heart bearing some hesitation, Anon placed a hand on the top card of the deck and drew it. He waited exactly one second before turning the card around. \n\n   The card's art was that of an angelic being\u2014one that looked like a cross between a human and dino\u2014residing on top of a cloud while blowing a trumpet. Below it, a human male and a ptero female reached out to the angeling being, as if either asking for salvation or begging for forgiveness. \n\n   Anon looked at the card\u2019s name. Before he could say the name himself, Stella spoke it for him.\n\n   \u201cUpright Judgement,\u201d Stella stated as she leaned her head next to Anon\u2019s. \u201cYou are being called to follow a new path or incorporate a new practice in your life. What you have and where you are is not who you're meant to be. It\u2019s time to embrace change. A new era is about to begin...\u201d Stella explained. \u201cAnon\u2026 I think\u2026 I think this means that\u2026\u201d the dino didn\u2019t finish her words, the weight of the card\u2019s meaning hitting her so hard that it forced her to take a seat.\n\n   Anon and Stella once more grew quiet as they absorbed the meaning of the card. As the two reconnected and reconciled friends looked at each other, they both knew that all the events the led to this point couldn\u2019t all be mere coincidence. The odds were too low and the world too chaotic. Yet what else could it be?\n\n   Anon wasn\u2019t one to believe in such things as hokey religions and fate, but even he was finding it hard to rationalize it\u2026\n\n   Before either Stella or Anon could say another word to each other, the door to their room opened. In walked a pterosaur doctor, his light brown skin accentuating the orange crests on his head and underbeak. Unlike other dinos of his species though, one of his wings looked shriveled. From the scars and missing pieces, it looked like it had gotten crippled many years earlier... \n\n   Anon\u2019s eyes went wide with shock as memories began flooding back to him. \n\n   Stella, for her part, stood up, her hands moving up to her mouth as she tried, and failed to suppress a gasp.\n\n   The pterosaur looked at the stegosaur and human before his gaze fell squarely on Anon. As it did, his expression changed to a mixture of nostalgic delight and barely restrained wrath.\n\n   \u201cHello... \u2018brother'...\u201d the dino spat, his every syllable laden to the brim with vitriol, almost as if speaking the words caused the dino\u2019s beak to ache and his very stomach to turn.\n\n   Anon\u2019s eyes, still wide\u2014and mouth just as widely agape\u2014could only form one name on his tongue...\n\n   \u201cN-Naser?\u201d"},"A Better End Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Multiple","A Better End Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"   Chapter 3 - The Tower\n\n   \u201cHello... \u2018brother'...\u201d the pterodactyl spat, his every syllable laded to the brim with vitriol, almost as if speaking the words caused the dino\u2019s beak to ache and his very stomach to turn.\n\n   Anon\u2019s eyes, still wide\u2014and mouth just as widely agape\u2014could only form one name on his tongue\u2026\n\n   \u201cN-Naser?\u201d\n\n   There was no answer from Naser. Instead, the dino only continued giving the human a steely, hateful glare.  \n\n   The room went as quiet and as still as a morgue after Anon\u2019s words. As the seconds ticked by, neither human nor pterodactyl spoke another word. The only hint that time had not stopped was the sound of the clock's hands and the faint hum of the fluorescent lights.    \n\n   Stella was the first person in the room to break the silence. \u201cNaser\u2026 is that... really you?\u201d she asked, taking a single step forward.  As the stego inspected her former classmate and once-upon-a-time top student, she found herself scarcely able to believe what she was seeing. As she tried looking deep into Naser's eyes, she found herself looking into what almost seemed like a void. It was that more than anything that forced her body to move between Anon and Naser, almost as if her instinct warned her that something terrible was about to happen between them. \n\n   Much like with Anon, Naser disappeared not long after graduating from Volcano High. Unlike Anon, Naser\u2019s departure had less to do with completely falling off the face of the earth and more with his entry into medical school. Everyone knew where Naser would go. They just never expected him to go so soon and so unceremoniously. After four years of absence, to see him standing before her garbed in a doctor\u2019s coat and with a grim look of ice-cold fury sent chills run down her spine. In her mind, she had wanted their reunion to be perfect, her and the others laughing about their lives up to that point. But, of course, considering everything that had happened up to that point, that dream was just that... a dream.\n\n   Naser redirected his hate-filled stare towards Stella. While downright soft compared to the glower he had on Anon, it nonetheless remained sharp enough to pierce through steel. \u201cStella,\u201d the ptero acknowledged. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking\u2026 what are you doing here with\u2026 him...?\u201d he hissed his last words out, almost like it was taking all his willpower to not rush forward and strangle Anon.\n\n   Stella, swallowing hard and giving a side glance towards Anon, put on the best smile that she could muster on her lips. \u201cOh, you know, the usual that you\u2019d do with someone you haven\u2019t seen in four years! Catch up, reminisce a bit, be glad that they\u2019re alive...\u201d She took another step to the right, this time getting completely between Naser and Anon. \u201cStuff like that!\u201d she added with a wave of her hand and a giggle.\n\n   Naser sighed and put a hand to the ridge of his nose. \u201cStella\u2026 you\u2026 haven\u2019t changed at all.\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s brow furrowed a bit. Even so, she still gave her former classmate a broad simper. \u201cSure haven\u2019t!\u201d she exclaimed, giving Naser a wink while sticking her tongue out.\n\n   Naser took an ominous step forward. \u201cStella\u2026 I\u2019m only going to say this once. Get out of here.\u201d He again set his glare on Anon.\n\n   Stella\u2019s smile completely dissolved as she took a step forward and glared at Naser. \u201cNo,\u201d she snapped in reply. \u201cNaser\u2026 I know that you\u2019re angry at Anon, b\u2014\u201d\n\n   \u201cANGRY!?\u201d Naser shouted at the top of his lungs. His raised tone, combined with a contorted grimace of utter wrath, completely interrupted whatever it was that Stella wanted to say, causing her to flinch and recoil backward. \u201c\u2018Angry\u2019 doesn\u2019t even BEGIN to describe what I\u2019m feeling at this second!\u201d \n\n   Before Stella could even think of something else to say, Naser took another step forward. As he did, he clenched his fists into white-knuckled fists as he glared fiery daggers at Anon. \u201cNever in my life have I felt the rage I\u2019m feeling at this very instant. Four years; four FUCKING years I\u2019ve carried this!\u201d he pointed an accusatory finger towards the human. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all because of him! He caused everything to fall apart! Our perfect lives, our perfect futures! If it wasn\u2019t for that... fucker, Fang wouldn\u2019t have run away. If it wasn\u2019t for him, Naomi wouldn\u2019t have dumped me like a piece of trash. If it wasn\u2019t for him, I wouldn\u2019t have had to work my ass off so hard to keep my parents from falling further into hopelessness!\u201d He set his gaze back on Stella. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not only me he fucked over. Trish, Reed, Rosa, even you! EVERYONE would have had a better life if it wasn\u2019t for this self-centered piece of shit!\u201d\n\n   Despite quaking in her shoes in response to Naser\u2019s outburst, Stella took yet another step forward. Her move put her only inches away from her former classmate's face. It was only at that distance that Stella noticed how much taller Naser had gotten in the last four years. Tall enough that he was on par with his father now. \u201cAnon may be responsible for what happened with Fang\u2026 but he\u2019s not to blame for everyone else\u2019s misfortune!\u201d Stella snapped back at Naser, this time poking him in the chest for added emphasis.\n\n   Naser scoffed and looked at Stella with disbelief. \u201cAre you that deluded? You can trace everyone\u2019s misfortunes back to Anon!\u201d\n\n   Stella looked like she was ready to start shouting at Naser when Anon suddenly spoke.\n\n   \u201cStella,\u201d he started, causing the stego to turn back and look at him. \u201cNaser\u2026 Naser\u2019s right...\u201d\n\n   Stella shook her head in disbelief. Anon only closed his eyes and let out a sigh. \u201cNaser\u2026 I\u2026 I know I don\u2019t have any right to say this\u2026 but I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\n\n   Naser practically shoved his way past Stella to stand right next to the human\u2019s bed. From up above, the pterodactyl fixed the human with a glower so fervent that his amber eyes felt like they could start a fire at any second. As he did, he grasped his hands into fists, the skin on his knuckles threatening to tear from the force.\n\n   \u201cNo. You\u2019re not sorry,\u201d Naser replied before lunging forward and grabbing Anon by the gruff of his hospital gown. With a rage-full lift, he brought the human up so he was at eye level with him. \u201cIf you were sorry, you wouldn't have ever shown your face in this town again!\u201d\n\n   \u201cAnon!\u201d Stella shouted as she rushed forward to try and break Naser\u2019s grip on the human. She wrapped her hands around the pterodactyl's arm, but she found she didn\u2019t have enough muscle to make the arm budge even a millimeter. \u201cPut him down!\u201d she shouted, tears pooling in his eyes as she struggled to separate the human and dino. \u201cPlease!\" she sobbed. \"This\u2026 this isn't what friends should be doing to each other...\u201d\n\n   Naser scoffed in reply to Stella's words. Despite the fury on his face remaining\u2014if not intensifying\u2014he let go of Anon. The human fell back on the bed, coughing and attempting to scramble away from the sizeable pissed-off pterodactyl still standing over him. \n\n   \u201c...\u2018Friend\u2019...\u201d Naser repeated in a sickened tone as he stepped away from Anon's bedside. He did not say another word as he snatched the clipboard at the base of the bed and looked it over. After reading it, he seized the top page, crumpling it in his hand and stuffing it in his coat. Without so much as another word, he turned around and opened the door. But before he left the room, he gave Anon and Stella one final glance before walking out and shutting the door.\n\n   Anon let out a deep breath and let himself collapse. He put a hand on his chest and tried to calm his speeding heart. But, unfortunately, it was easier said than done.\n\n   Stella fell upon Anon and began checking his body for any injury. When she found none, she let out a massive sigh of relief and sat back down on the nearby couch. Seconds later, she began sniffing as she brought a hand up to her face in a desperate attempt to hold back tears.\n\n   Despite feeling like he had no right to, Anon again put a hand on his friend's shoulder. Like she had done earlier, the lime stego grabbed the human's hand and cuddled it up to her face. Anon was again taken back by the softness of Stella\u2019s skin. It made his face feel warm and brought him ease. Or at least, as much ease as he could have considered what had happened. \n\n   Anon looked in Stella\u2019s direction, expecting to see a semblance of a smile or something to tell him that she was alright. Instead, he was only met with a sunken and defeated expression from the stegosaur.\n\n   \u201cStella,\u201d Anon started, forcing the stego to look him in the eyes again. \u201c...This\u2026 this wasn\u2019t... your fault\u2026\u201d he whispered, all the while gently cradling her cheek.\n\n   Stella slowly began perking in response to the human\u2019s words. She looked at him with her own light blue eyes. The deeper she looked, though, the damper her eyes got. It wasn\u2019t long before her vision became a hazy mess as tears began flowing. Whatever smile she once carried vanished as the total weight of the last few minutes sunk in. She let another soul-crushing sob, and before the human could say or do anything to comfort his friend, she fell upon his chest, grabbing hold of his arms for support all the while wailing in anguish.\n\n   Anon wanted so badly to say something to ease Stella\u2019s sadness, but he couldn\u2019t find any words that he could say that wouldn\u2019t be in agreement with Naser. \u2018He has every right to hate me,\u2019 he bitterly yet legitimately thought. He had more than earned his former classmate's ire\u2026 and a hell of a lot more than that. With no other thought in his mind, he put a hand on Stella\u2019s head in an attempt to comfort her as she cried her heart out\u2026\n\n \n\n   Naser stood outside of Anon\u2019s room for about a second before scoffing and walking off in disgust. He couldn\u2019t fathom why Stella would stick by Anon considering he had done everything in his power to scorn her once upon a time. \u2018Yet there she stood defending the bastard. Then she dares to cry because I have every right at being angry?\u2019\n\n   Naser hissed in annoyance, bringing his fist up in preparation to hit the nearest wall. Instead, he took a deep breath and exhaled. He reached into his coat and pulled out the crumbled-up paper he had taken from Anon\u2019s bed and looked it over again, a grimace forming on his lips. \n\n   Unlike everyone else, Naser had not once accepted that Anon had gone and died without no one noticing. Deep down in the pterodactyl's heart, he knew the human was too stubborn and spiteful. He had been so confident in that knowledge, he waited, imagining for four years what he would do to the human if he ever saw him again. He again took a deep breath to get his anger under control. He did this now as much as he did when he began medical school right out of high school. But, in a twist of irony that wasn\u2019t entirely lost on him. The same unbridled fury he felt for the human helped him get through his higher education. Begrudgingly, the rage he couldn\u2019t channel towards beating Anon became his fuel. It drove him to work harder than any of his peers, pushing his very natural limits past the point where anyone else would have burnt out. It cost him though, as he eschewed all social connections and any personal growth beyond his medical career. Whereas other peers found friends, even love, with each other, he pushed on with his singular goal. Yet as he got closer to his graduation, a deep fog of uncertainty fell over him. What would he do when he reached his end goal? Where would he go? Graduating not top of the class, but also early earned him calls from hospitals the world over. A ticket to anywhere in the world... yet he chose Volcaldera Bluffs' hospital. The equivalent of working at a convenience store. \n\n   What had brought Naser back to the very place that he had run away from just a little over two weeks ago? He didn't know. Or least, he hadn't known... until earlier that day, when he had seen Anon\u2019s name and face in the recent admittance records. How he had believed it to be a trick of his imagination. That he would read over the name again only to realize his brain had played a cruel joke on him. That the picture of the bald, almost featureless human he had seen was his wishful thinking and nothing else. But a closer inspection had revealed to him that it was no hoax. Anon was in his hospital, and he was for once in a position of power over the human, his life in his hands. Anon was back into his life... except for the troublesome fact that Anon had returned to his life as a patient\u2026\n\n   For the first time since finishing medical school, Naser felt great regret at taking the Hippocratic oath. As a doctor, he could not harm anyone. Sure, there wasn\u2019t a technical punishment for breaking the oath, but becoming an oathbreaker wasn\u2019t exactly an appealing prospect. There was also the threat of getting slapped with malpractice. If that happened, then all his struggles and sacrifices graduating from medical school would be for naught. \n\n   In the absence of a more immediate solution to his problem, Naser came up with a plan. A risky strategy, but one that was his only real recourse. \n\n   First, Naser had claimed Anon as a sibling. The idea made his stomach churn. It not only meant having to pay for the human's hospital stay out of his own pocket, but it also meant faking a blood relation with the human. Even so, having Anon as his brother on paper gave him a bit more leeway for the next part of his plan, which was to become Anon\u2019s physician. Once he had direct and exclusive access to the human's health, he would be in almost complete authority.\n\n   From there, all it would take to take care of Anon would be a convenient \u2018accident.' Maybe a bit more air would find its way inside of Anon's IV solution. Maybe Anon would need some kind of surgery, at which point one of his major arteries could be \u2018accidentally\u2019 severed. Or perhaps Anon would need to ingest some type of medicine, and he would \u2018accidentally\u2019 get drugs that were past their expiration date. Even in the best-operated hospitals, accidents happened and were a lot more common than people wanted to admit... \n\n   With thoughts that shouldn\u2019t live inside of a doctor\u2019s mind, Naser gave the paper in his hand one final confirmatory read before once again stuffing the sheet in his coat. He took a deep breath and buried whatever leftover anger he still had. Then, with his mind fixed on the next part of his plan, he walked up to the second floor\u2019s receptionist. \n\n   \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d Naser said in a confident, albeit forced, tone.\n\n   \u201cAfternoon. How can I help you?\u201d the receptionist, an earthen brown gorgosaurus in a blue nurse's outfit, asked without turning away from her computer screen.\n\n   Naser inwardly scoffed at the receptionist\u2019s rudeness but maintained his smile. \u201cI need to speak to Director Joshua if he\u2019s available.\u201d\n\n   The receptionist finally looked away from her computer screen and inspected Naser a bit before putting on a simper. \u201cOh, you\u2019re the new doctor we hired two weeks ago! Naser Aaran, right?\u201d\n\n   \u201cThe one and only,\u201d Naser answered, the smirk on his lips never wavering despite how forced it was.\n\n   The nurse ran a hand through her short curly black hair as she gave her full attention to Naser. \u201cA lot of talk going around about you!\u201d She said, leaning in a bit closer to the pterodactyl. \u201cIs it true that you graduated one year early?\u201d\n\n   Naser felt his brow twitch a bit but maintained a polite smile on his lips. \u201cYes, I did. Wasn\u2019t easy!\u201d He answered. He wanted so badly to grimace at his own words, but he couldn\u2019t let the receptionist pick up on any sign of weakness.\n\n   The receptionist let out a whistle and went back to typing something on her computer. \u201cWell, congratulations on the D.O. then,\u201d she concluded whatever it was that she was clicking away at and again turned to look at Naser. \u201cSo, you want to see if Mr. Joshua is available?\u201d\n\n   \u201cYes, that would be very considerate.\u201d\n\n   The receptionists again perked an eyebrow. \u201cThe director is a very busy man. What\u2019s the occasion?\u201d\n\n   Naser steeled himself for the words that were about to come out of his mouth\u2026\n\n   \u201cWell, you see, my\u2026 brother\u2026 recently got into an accident, and he wound up admitted into our hospital.\u201d \n\n   The receptionist\u2019s expression softened. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, is he okay?\u201d\n\n   Naser had to fight the urge to frown at the reminder. \u201cHe\u2019s doing fine! Was out for a while, but he woke up less than an hour ago\u2026\u201d\n\n   The receptionist perked at hearing the news. \u201cOh, wonderful!\u201d\n\n   \u2018Yeah, absolutely wonderful...\u2019 Naser thought as he continued to force a grin on his lips. \u201cUnfortunately, he suffered some cranial trauma, so he might be here for a while.\u201d\n\n   \u201cOh, so my guess is that you want to transfer his health care to your account?\u201d The receptionist asked Naser\n\n   \u201cAlready did,\u201d Naser answered, the words causing him no short supply of grief. \u201cI feel like I could give him a bit more direct care though, so I wanted to ask the director if I could become his direct physician. At latest until he's ready for his discharge.\u201d\n\n   The receptionist was silent and stoic for a second before giving Naser a warm smile. \u201cAw, family really does stick together!\u201d she announced in a sickenly cute voice, one that the ptero couldn't help but compare to his ex-girlfriend's mannerisms.\n\n   Naser forced himself to grin even wider despite the vile he was feeling churning in his stomach. As the discomfort in his gut grew, he started to worry that he might develop an ulcer. \n\n   \u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and page the director. Give me a second.\u201d The receptionist said she reached for the phone next to her computer and dialed a number with practiced speed. A few seconds later, the receptionist spoke to the receiver. \u201cDirector Joshua? Yes. I have Doctor Naser here wanting to talk to you. Yeah. Says it\u2019s about his sibling who was recently admitted to our hospital. Hmmm. Okay. I\u2019ll send him to you right away then.\u201d\n\n   The receptionist hung the phone and turned back to Naser. \u201cThe director will be waiting for you. His office is on the fifth floor. Take a left after you leave the elevators and head straight. You won\u2019t be able to miss the big double doors to his office.\u201d\n\n   \u201cThank you so much,\u201d Naser responded, giving the receptionist a smile and a quick wave before taking off towards the elevators in the foyer. After less than a two minute walk, he reached the elevators and pressed the call button. The elevator only took a minute to arrive. To Naser\u2019s relief, it was empty. \u2018Will give my cheeks a chance to rest,\u2019 he thought as he stepped into the lift and pressed the button for the fifth floor. The elevator then took off without a fuzz, traveling at a reasonable pace, all the while playing a pleasant little jingle.\n\n   As the elevator crawled its way up to the fifth floor, other errant thoughts entered Naser\u2019s mind. He wondered what his parents were up to. He hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to them in four years. Since his return to Volcadera Bluffs two weeks earlier, he still hadn't worked up the courage to even go near his old neighborhood. A part of him felt that he didn\u2019t deserve to face his parents again. How could he when he had failed both as a brother and a son? If he saw his parents again, would they be proud to hear how he graduated so early at the expense of any social and emotional growth? He knew his mother at least wouldn't want to hear that. And of course, there was the biggest elephant in the room, Fang. A part of him dreamed of returning home to find his sister there, waiting with the news that not long after he left for medical school, she changed her mind and came back home. Of course, he knew that was only a dream. Fang vanished so abruptly from everyone's life it was almost as if she had died. The scariest part was that with how Fang left to trace behind, they could very well be dead and no one would ever know\u2026\n\n   Naser put a hand over his face and fought back some tears threatening to form in his eyes. His lack of knowledge on Fang\u2019s whereabouts tormented him to no end\u2026 and he would do anything to just know that she was still alive...\n\n   ...Anything...\n\n   Naser forcefully turned his thoughts away from Fang and onto something else. His mind went back to recalling his conversation with the receptionist. Yet as she thought back to the young and somewhat cute gorgosaur, he recalled someone else who also took a chunk of his soul with her when she left him. His high school ex, Naomi...\n\n   'God-dammit\u2026\u2019 Naser thought as memories of his ex flooded his mind. How he had loved and cared for her\u2026 until she had stopped loving him back. He never understood why she turned so hostile near the end of their relationship. A part of him had always had a suspicion that he desperately wished was false; that she never loved him for who he was, but only for the prestige he brought to her. Blind as he might have been in his younger years, age had brought with it brutal and unforgiving hindsight. In retrospect, he should have seen the signs. Naomi, after all, had always striven to be the best at any one time. Perfectionist to a fault, the moment he showed even a single sign of imperfection, she tossed him aside like a moldy apple in a basket of plum and juicy ones. But like the crazy and loving fool that he was, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she was doing good with her life. Surely, if anyone had made something of themselves, it was Naomi...\n\n   The elevator\u2019s door slid open, and Naser stepped out. He vanished all other thoughts from his mind with an exhale except for those of this most immediate goal. He turned left as the receptionist had instructed and then walked down the hall. The hall itself sported wooden walls. Potted plants and pictures of people that couldn\u2019t be anyone else but members of the board of doctors from years past finished the decor. The added fact that they all sported smiles that seemed superficial only added to Naser\u2019s feeling of unease. As he reached the door, he paused to fix up his coat and ran over his words again. He had come too far to get his words jumbled up and cause hitches to his plans.\n\n   With a twist of the door handles, Naser stepped into the director\u2019s office. It was a relatively large space on the simple side, the only pieces of furniture being a large old-styled work desk and a pair of desk chairs facing the desk. What parts of the wall weren\u2019t large glass windows made of the same wooding out in the hall leading to the office. Instead, much like the hallway outside, the walls donned paintings of natural vistas and a few medical diagrams on both human and dinosaur anatomy. Sitting on the other side of his work desk was a blue-toned archelon who Naser had to guess had to be somewhere in his early sixties. Yet his estimation could have been wildly off, considering the dino still sported a complete set of black-toned hair and even a small yet well-maintained beard. Mr. Joshua also looked sternly build, his chest broad and shockingly well-toned. Considering that he had to lug around a daily bulky shell, it made sense that the director would be on the burly side. Naser couldn\u2019t help but imagine what his boss would have looked like in his younger years. Maybe something between a linebacker and a marine.\n\n   Before Naser\u2019s thoughts could drift away further from him, he\u2019s snapped back to reality when director Joshua acknowledges his presence. \u201cAh, Doctor Naser. What can I do for you today?\u201d\n\n   With one final inhale, Naser steps forward to the base of director Joshua\u2019s desk.\n\n   \u201cGood afternoon Doctor Joshua.\u201d\n\n   \u201cPlease, call me Joshua,\u201d the director responded with an amiable smile.\n\n   Naser cleared his throat. \u201cWell then, Mr. Joshua, I came today because I need to make a request.\u201d\n\n   The director sighed at Naser's unwillingness to stop being so formal and instead moved on. \u201cAh yes, the situation with your \u2018sibling\u2019...\u201d the elder dino said as he reached into a drawer on his desk and brought out a manilla folder he likely had prepped for when Naser got there.\n\n   Naser\u2019s eyes widened as he felt ice drop into the pit of his stomach.\n\n   \u201cDoctor Naser\u2026 I have the understanding that you claimed Mr. Anon Y. Mous as your sibling\u2026 even though you and he are, well... quite unrelated,\u201d Director Joshua started as he gave the files a read. \u201cIt says here that he attended Volcano High for the last six months of his senior year. The same school and same grade level as you.\u201d\n\n   Naser gave his boss a single nod of acknowledgment. \u2018How could I have been so damn stupid?\u2019 he thought to himself as he recalled how every person, no matter how \u2018obscure\u2019 they were in the eyes of society, still had a medical record. It wasn\u2019t like they were living in the middle ages anymore, where all it took was moving from one town to another to completely change identities. What was more, Anon had served in the navy before being medically discharged. So he, of all people, would have a medical record on hand.\n\n   Naser wanted to beat himself up so bad for his stupidity...\n\n   \u201cSo\u2026 my understanding of the situation is that this patient is a\u2026 dear friend of yours, is he not?\u201d the director inquired bluntly, snapping Naser out of his thoughts.\n\n   Naser almost recoiled at his boss\u2019 words. Only practiced stoicism kept him from showing anything other than a confirmatory glance towards the director.\n\n   Director Joshua turned his attention back to Anon\u2019s profile. \u201cSays here, Mr. Mous did not finish school and went straight into the navy\u2019s PACT program. There, he served a four-year tour of duty until suffering an injury on a ladder well. He was then medically discharged two and a half weeks ago.\u201d He closed the manilla folder and put it down. \u201cSounds like he\u2019s had a rough four years.\"\n\n   \"That he has, Mr. Joshua,\" Naser said in his best monotone in an attempt to salvage the situation for himself. \n\n   Director Joshua narrowed his eyes for a second before suddenly changing gears and smiling quite widely. \"No wonder you want to help him out so badly!\u201d he almost cheered unapologetically.\n\n   Naser couldn\u2019t bring himself to say a word. In his mind, he wanted to snap at his boss and tell him that the last thing he had on his mind was helping the human who turned his whole life upside down. After some more careful consideration though, he gave his boss a nod in reply.\n\n   \"The first thing that comes to your mind on seeing an old friend in need is to help him out. That right there is the true spirit of a doctor,\" the director said with perhaps a bit more cheer than was necessary. \"I'm proud of you, my boy!\" he ended his words with a thumb's up.\n\n   Naser wasn't quite sure what to make of his boss' words, but something about them struck him in a way that he couldn't quite describe. A part of him felt revulsion at the idea of helping Anon do anything besides pay for his crimes. Yet, another part of him felt an odd sense of satisfaction at being the better man by assisting Anon to mend whatever wounds had caused him to become so hollow and pathetic in the first place. Yes, he wanted to see Anon pay for his sins... but did he want to damage someone who was already broken to begin with?\n\n   For the first time in four years, Naser found himself questioning his own anger...\n\n   \"Standard insurance policy would dictate that I remove Mr. Anon from your medical insurance, but seeing as you went to so much trouble to fill out his paperwork, I\u2019ll let it slide.\u201d The director said with a chuckle, snapping Naser back to reality. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a fan of how insurances see people as only money Anyway. Besides, it\u2019s not exactly illegal. Just unusual.\u201d The archelon sat upright and put both of his hands back on the desk. \u201cI get the feeling though that the insurance coverage situation wasn\u2019t why you wanted to talk to me, though,\u201d he added in a moderately ominous tone.\n\n   Naser paused to consider what he should do next. His plan was already on very shaky ground; his luck pushed pretty far as it was. He was fortunate that his boss was such an understanding person, but even he would no doubt raise an eyebrow at his request, especially now that the truth was out\u2026\n\n   Naser gripped his hands tight. \u2018No. I\u2019ve come too far now to pussy out,\u2019 he thought resolutely. Maybe it was the rage still burning in him, or perhaps he had really lost his mind from four years of missing out on sleep. Whatever the case, his father hadn\u2019t raised a coward. He was an Aaran, for Raptor Jesus\u2019s sake!\n\n   \u201cMr. Joshua, I want to request becoming Anon\u2019s physician,\u201d Naser almost blurted out.\n\n   The director raised an eyebrow in response to Naser's request. \u201cThat is\u2026 highly unusual,\" he said bluntly. \"Why do you want to do that?\"\n\n   Naser swallowed a lump in his throat and gave his boss as warm a smile as he could muster. \"Anon is... someone dear to me. As his friend, I feel like I'm... uniquely qualified to help him, both physically and emotionally.\"\n\n   The director once again looked at Naser with a flat, indecipherable look. \"Normally, its the patient who makes a physician request, not the other way around,\u201d he announced, bringing a finger to his chin and closing his eyes in contemplation. For five long seconds, the office went quiet as the director submerged himself in thought. Once those five seconds were up, director Joshua opened his eyes again and gave Naser a warm smile. \u201cWell, seeing as you are already claiming Mr. Anon as your sibling and are paying for half of his medical expenses, I don\u2019t see the problem with you also being his physician. Although...\u201d he rapped his fingers over the desk as his expression soured somewhat. \"It reminds me of a similar situation that happened many years ago.\"\n\n   \"O-oh?\" Naser asked almost instinctually.\n\n   \"Yeah,\" the director continued as he leaned back on his office chair. \"Sixty years ago, there was a doctor who also claimed that he had a sibling he wanted to personally oversee. At the time, it was a bit more common, so no one really batted an eye. Then, one week later, the patient died in the middle of an operation. The cause? An accidental rupture of a major artery.\" The older dino shook his head solemnly as he moved to his computer and typed out something on it. \"The doctor in charge of the patient was promptly fired and stripped of all his medical licenses.\" The director turned to look at Naser again, only this time, much less warmly than before. \"Accidents do happen in the medical field, but it is our job as physicians to keep said accidents from becoming more than statistical anomalies. Remember our oath as doctors: share your knowledge, support the unwell and downtrodden, and do no harm.\" \n\n   Naser, unable to think or say anything in response to his boss' words, nodded in acknowledgment.\n\n   With a nod of his own, the director turned back to his computer one more time and quickly typed out something on his keyboard. Five seconds later, he hit the device's final button before again turning back to face the pterodactyl. \u201cDoctor Naser, Mr. Anon is now in your care. All that's left now is to fill out some paperwork.\u201d\n\n   Naser let out the air he had been holding in his lungs and tried to smile, only to find a part of himself unable to. Finally, through sheer force of will, he forced the corners of his mouth to rise in the closest facsimile of a smile that he could form given the maelstrom of emotion in his heart. \u201cThank you so much, Mr. Joshua.\u201d\n\n   \u201cNo problem at all, my boy. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have some more work to get done before the sun sets.\u201d\n\n   Naser gave his boss a nod and walked out of the office, closing the door behind him as gently as he could. Once he heard the mechanism click, he let out a huge sigh and hobbled towards the nearest wall.\n\n   He should have been ecstatic. He should have been celebrating the fact that his plan was finally coming to fruition. Finally, four years of misery were close to ending in a single great moment of cathartic retribution against a person who most certainly deserved it, and then some. Yet despite being so close to the finish line, Naser very suddenly felt utterly ill.\n\n   Without another word or thought from him, Naser moved towards the elevator at a brisk pace, reaching the lift one minute earlier than when he had first sought out the director. Without wasting a second on errant thoughts, he called up the machine. The instant the doors slid open, the dino stepped in, once again finding the compartment empty. As before, the silence gave the ptero mind ample chance to think over what was to happen next. It wasn't long before a voice in the back of his head screamed and begged him to stop and think about what he was planning. 'This isn't who you are,' the voice screamed into his ear. 'What's revenge going to earn you? Will it magically make Fang return home? Will it set right everything that went wrong with your friends and family? Will it really make you happy?'\n\n   Naser looked down at his shoes and brought a hand up to his face. Then, with another sigh, he leaned against the elevator's walls and closed his eyes. For the first time in four years, the rage that had given him so much purpose feel frail and petty\u2026\n\n   Naser sighed again and looked down at his hand. With a grim expression, he clenched his hands shut and grimaced with newfound determination.\n\n   It was time to end it once and for all...   \n\n \n\n   Anon opened his eyes and groggily looked at the room\u2019s clock. It was exactly one hour and one minute since Naser had so shockingly reappeared into his life. \n\n   Anon hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d ever see his ex-classmate again, but fate, it seemed, had a funny way of playing things out. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was his well-deserved lousy luck or some curse cast upon him by Neptune. If it was a curse, then it had to be because of that one time he kicked an albatross off the deck of his ship. He\u2019d been told hundreds of times by his more superstitious comrades that killing a seabird was grounds for a nautical curse. Anon being Anon though, he hadn\u2019t cared for some hookey seaman ghost story.\n\n   Now though, as he thought back to all that had happened up to his hospitalization. His accident at sea, the dreams of a better life mocking him, his spiral into substance abuse self-destruction, his seeing of Fang once again, and now Naser of all people in the world working in the same hospital he wound up in. Anon couldn\u2019t help but feel like there was something grander out there making sure he started paying all the dues he owed.\n\n   The human shut his eyes and recalled all of Naser\u2019s words to him. While he would have loved to pretend they meant nothing to him, he knew deep down that they hadn\u2019t been harsh enough. He deserved all the vitriol that Naser could conjure at him and then some more.\n\n   Anon tried to shift his body around, but then he felt something on top of his body. Turning his eyes down, he spotted Stella\u2019s head lying on top of his waist. Confused at first, he carefully slid a hand out of his covers and moved to poke one of his friends\u2019 green hair buns. He paused when he heard a snort escape from the stego's mouth. \n\n   Blinking a few times to process the scene before him, Anon followed Stella\u2019s body and noticed how she had shifted the sofa next to his bed so that it now faced his bedside rather than the room\u2019s entrance. With the new position, she was able to plop her head and chest over him more comfortably, her face directed at the door, almost as if serving like some kind of watch dog.\n\n   Anon sighed and shook his head. \u2018She pours out her heart to me, and next thing I know, she\u2019s doing something like this\u2026\u2019 \n\n   At that thought, Anon found himself struggling to piece together how Stella could like someone as socially dense as he was. \u2018And not like as a friend either,\u2019 he thought in surprise. The absolute last thing he had expected to hear that day was how Stella had liked him as more than a friend back in high school. It was a heck of a lot more than he deserved even back then. His more cynical side wanted to believe that Stella\u2019s revelation was a spur-of-the-moment type of thing. That she got her words confused with some anime quote and only wanted to make him feel good before once again departing from his life. Yet as he stared at the sleeping dino on his lap, that cynical voice was having a harder time convincing him otherwise.\n\n   The human tried to think what was it about him that Stella liked. The obvious answer would have been their shared love of anime, but Anon felt that wasn\u2019t quite the answer. Both Stella and himself hadn\u2019t exactly been the shining beacons of popularity four years ago. Could it have been their shared status as social outcasts? Stella always seemed to have a way of making others avoid her, no doubt thanks to her general awkwardness and obsession with the occult. As for Anon\u2026 aside from being the only \u2018skinny\u2019 in a school of dinos, there had also been the whole doxing incident. In fact, that damned incident had very nearly cost him his life when he took that tumble down the stairs. \u2018If it hadn\u2019t been for Fang that day\u2026\u2019\n\n   Anon paused in his tracks. He'd almost forgotten in the chaos of his last few days that there had been someone else who liked him once upon a time. Someone that, despite all their flaws and shattered outlook on their own existance, had still found it in their hearts to love him all the same... \n\n   ...At least until he fucked it all up in a drunken stupor...\n\n   Anon took another look at Stella and grimaced. A nasty taste began to fill his mouth as he realized that he didn't deserve Stella's kindness. 'After all, people don't change... so I'm only going to end up fucking things up for her...' he thought as he put a hand on the stego's shoulder. 'I deserve my current misery. No need to drag someone else down with me as well.'\n\n   Before Anon could shake Stella awake, the door to his room swung open. Almost as if startled awake by an electrical prod, Stella jumped awake, turning to face the door and once again placing herself between the human and whoever had just dared intrude into the area. As she did all that, her face twisted into a scowl and her hands curled into fists.\n\n   \"Woah!\" an orange-toned ankylosaur in a florally adorned black dress yelped, raising her hands up defensively. \"\u00a1\u00bfQue hice para enojarte, Stella?!\" Rosa shouted as she took a step backward.\n\n   Upon seeing her friend's face, Stella relaxed her pose and expression before letting out a huge sigh of relief. Before Rosa could say another word\u2014or think about anything really\u2014the stegosaur rushed forward to tightly embrace the orange dino, all the while sniffling as whatever anger she once had dissolved as happiness took over.\n\n   Rosa blinked a few times before patting Stella on the back. \"There, there, mija. Whatever's wrong, it's okay...\"\n\n   Stella nodded and broke the hug before walking back to Anon's bedside, where she again sat down on the couch and leaned back with a groan.\n\n   Rosa let out a slight chuckle as she closed the door behind her and set her eyes on Anon. The moment she did, her expression considerably brightened at seeing her old classmate awake and lucid. \n\n   \"So... An-On... it's uh...\" Rosa started, all the while rubbing the back of her head and giving the human a wide simper. \"...Ha pasado mucho tiempo... \u00bfno?\"\n\n   It takes a few moments for Anon to translate Rosa's Spanish in his head. When he does, he gives the orange dino a nod of acknowledgment but says not a word. \n\n   Rosa began fidgeting a bit with her hands, seemingly unsure of what to say or do next. Finally, after a few seconds of awkward silence, she let out a sigh and walked right up to Anon's bedside. \"May I?\" She asked the human, who considered the dino's word for an attosecond before nodding.\n\n   With Anon's blessing, Rosa sat down on the edge of the bed, careful not to sit on his leg. Only once she found a seat did she let out the breath she had been holding in her lungs and looked Anon in the eyes. \"Look, An-On... I'm... I'm having trouble trying to figure out what to say here,\" she started in an uneven voice, almost as if she was struggling to keep her tone consistent. \"I-I mean...\" She grimaced as she leaned closer to the human's face. \"\u00a1Pense que estabas muerto!\" she abruptly shouted, her eyes slightly shimmering in the sterile light of the room and her cheeks reddening from a mixture of emotion. \"Stupido! First, y-you stop going to school! Then you disappear completely! Then no one sees or hears anything from you for four years. FOUR YEARS! And then... and then you suddenly show up again... b-but all beat up and... and...\" she scowled, all the while more tears welled in her eyes. \"\u00a1\u00bfQui\u00e9nes fueron los cabrones que te malmataron?!\" she asked, her face only growing a darker shade of red. \"When I find them, I'm going shove my chancla up their asses so far up they're going to be tasting leather for at least a month!\"\n\n   Anon shifted his eyes towards Stella in the vain hope of glimpsing some kind of answer from the lime green stego. She had taken the revelation that his attackers had been none other than himself relatively well, but Stella was Stella, and she really hadn't changed much in the last four years. Rosa, on the other hand, was a completely different story. He had no idea how she would handle the revelation that the one who had beat him up had been himself. If she was still the same fiery latina he remembered, then she would beat him back into another coma, all the while holding a great deal of disappointment in him... which, frankly, he found far worse than any anger she might have towards him.\n\n   When Stella only gave Anon a warm smile and a nod, the human came to the conclusion that he might as well face the music. He just hoped that the orange fury he recalled Rosa being capable of becoming had considerably dulled over the last four years...\n\n   \"About that...\" Anon started, setting his eyes directly into Rosa's crimson orbs. Then, with a deep breath of air and what little resolution he had wrangled into place, Anon narrated to Rosa just what had happened to him. He left nothing out, from the dreams to his overindulgence in alcohol and weed, and finally to his self-inflicted injuries.\n\n   Anon could practically feel the heat rising within Rosa. With one last exhale, he closed his eyes and prepared himself to receive the beating of his life...\n\n   ...Instead, Rosa let out a sob and grabbed Anon by the shoulders, bringing him in for a tight yet gentle embrace, her head resting on top of his head as her soft brown hair draped over Anon's cranium. \"\u00a1St-stupido!\" She shouted as she tightened her grip around the human's head. \"Y-you stupid, STUPID boy! Hiding away your pain and thinking that you're all alone in the w-world!\" she let out another sob, Anon feeling something wet hit the top of his bald head. \"It's okay An-On... everything's okay... estoy aqui for you...\"\n\n   Anon sat speechlessly. In his mind, he tried to rationalize why Rosa, of all people, would be as lovingly welcoming as she was being. He hadn't precisely been friendly towards the Hispanic dino in the past. If anything, he had been rude and dismissive. Perhaps not to the same level as he had been with Stella, but certainly enough to ensure that the ankylosaur would view him as nothing less than an asshole. Yet, despite having given her every right to shun him, there she was, embracing him like he was the most precious thing in her world at that moment.\n\n   Anon couldn't handle it. He broke away from Rosa's embrace and gently pushed her away from him. \"Why?\" he asked her, unable to keep his emotion from showing. \"Why are you being so nice to me?\"\n\n   Rosa's expression soured at Anon's words. \"Why am I being so nice?\" She asked with a growing scowl on her face. \"Why am I being so nice!?\" she repeated, this time standing up from the bed and crossing her arms.\n\n   Anon glanced sideways towards Stella, who only gave Anon a cheeky little smile that more or less said, 'you've done it now.' \n\n   \"Tell me An-On, are you really so pessimistic as to think that there wouldn't be anyone happy to see you again!?\" Rosa roared at Anon in the same way that one would expect to hear from a mother scolding her child. \"I don't know what kind of appalling life you've had since dropping out of school, but I'll have you know that I NEVER once saw you as anything less than an amigo!\" She again leaned close to the human and fixed him with a harsh yet somehow caring glower. \"Si, you were often rude and distant and definitely in need of some lessons in empathy, but deep down, I knew that wasn't the real you!\" the orange dino sighed again, and her expression and tone dropped. \"The doxing incident... it was pretty shameful... but it showed to me why you were so cold and distant and unemotional and willing to distance yourself from everyone... and I'm so, SO sorry something like that happened to you...\"\n\n   Anon was now the one to grow angry, his brow furrowing as he glared at Rosa. \"Why would you be sorry about me? Why did you even give me the time of day when you knew how terrible and pathetic I really am?\"\n\n   \"BECAUSE\u2014\" Rosa shouted back, her cheeks turning a bright shade of red to match her eyes. Before she could say anything else, she shut her mouth and let out a silent yell before closing her eyes. \"Porque vi lo bueno dentro de ti...\"\n\n   \"W-what?\" Anon asked, not quite sure if he had heard correctly.\n\n   Rosa breathed and fixed Anon with a stalwart yet gentle gaze. \"The first time I met you, you were just some idiota that ruined my flowers and couldn't even plant seedlings right! Que Raptor Jesus me perdone por decir esto, but I honestly expected to hate you! Yet, the more I got to know you in those beautification weekends and beyond, the more I realized that the front of callousness you built for yourself wasn't who you really were, and I...\" she turned away from the human, the red on her cheeks growing brighter. \"...I started to think to myself... 'este hombre solo necesita una buena chica a su lado para brillar...'\" She grit her teeth and turned back to face Anon. \"I-I know it sounds stupid. Childish even! But the idea of helping you surpass all your problems and support you as you became el hombre that I knew was buried somewhere inside was...\" She again closed her eyes, a warm smile spreading across her lips. \"By my lord on his cross of rock, was it a stupid childish idea that only ni\u00f1os could come up with! Como si el amor fuera realmente asi de facil...\" \n\n   Having sat in silence as Rosa poured out her heart out to Anon, Stella now had a look on her face somewhere between extreme astonishment and dainty melancholy. She didn't quite know how to feel about her friend's revelation on her feelings for Anon back in high school. Had the stego been a more jealous woman, she would have felt some anger at the disclosure. Yet, with how heartfelt Rosa had been, the only thing she felt was understanding, as well as a sense of relief. Relief that she wasn't alone in her past feelings towards Anon.\n\n   Anon, meanwhile, could barely wrap his head around what he had just learned from Rosa. The more the human tried to make sense of it, the more it baffled him. 'With Stella, I can understand. We were and still are weebs and still are awkward. We were loners looking for friends and someone to love us. But Rosa? Rosa and I just weren't compatible in high school. She was the polar opposite of everything I strove to be!' Anon thought as he gave the orange ankylosaur a look of disbelief.\n\n   Perhaps realizing the kind of emotional bomb she had dropped on the scene\u2014or maybe thinking that the conversation was best steered elsewhere\u2014Rosa cleared her throat and turned to face Stella. \"So, bichita,\" she started, the redness of her cheeks still visible despite her best attempts to move past the moment. \"Now that we know that An-On's okay... wanna go get some food? Maybe change out of that tracksuit you've been wearing all day?\"\n\n   Stella's expression expectantly soured. \"No,\" she replied bluntly.\n\n   Rosa raised an eyebrow and shifted her head back a bit. \"No? \u00bfPor que?\"\n\n   Stella looked to Anon, her eyes again filling with the anger, sadness, and pain from earlier that day. Her sight hung over the human for about a second, during which time she seemed to debate whether she wanted\u2014or rather needed\u2014to tell her friend of the complicated situation brewing. Meanwhile, while a good part of Anon's brain told him to not do anything to encourage more grief from Stella, the human knew that in this particular case, hiding the truth wasn't in anyone's favor. Gently, he grabbed hold of Stella's hand and gave her a nod of confirmation. Before the stego could open her mouth to speak, Anon turned to face Rosa and spoke for her. \"We met Naser earlier. He's a doctor in this hospital.\"\n\n   Rosa's eyes widened as a smile formed on her lips. \"Naser's here!?\" she asked with glee. \"\u00a1Ay Dios mio! \u00a1Esto es maravilloso! That means we can all reconnect with him and see how he's doing and what he's bee\u2014\"\n\n   \"He attacked Anon!\" Stella interrupted Rosa before the ankylosaur could go any further with her statement.\n\n   Rosa's expression did a 180 in a matter of nanoseconds. Where before she looked giddy and rapturous, on hearing Stella's words, her face twisted into a scowl of anger, her very eyes suddenly glowing with fury. \"\u00bf\u00a1Hizo QUE!?\" the now-ranging orange dino shouted so loudly that it was surprising there hadn't been a nurse or some other hospital staff rushing in to see what all the commotion was about.\n\n   Stella stood up and rushed to her friend's side. \"Rosa!\" Stella started, all the while putting a hand on the ankylosaur's shoulder. \"R-remember what we talked a-about!\"\n\n   Rosa shot a glare towards Stella, but rather than grow angrier, the dino shut her eyes tight and let out several hard and steamy snorts. When at last she was no longer fuming, the ankylosaur turned her full attention to Stella. \"Tell me everything!\"\n\n   Over the next half hour, Stella and Anon took turns telling Rosa everything that had happened before her arrival. They started from Anon's miraculous awakening thanks to Stella's terrible anime openings, followed up by stegosaur's heart to heart with the human\u2014complete with a recreation of her less than adequate but still well-meaning speech quoting Kamina from Gurren Laggan\u2014to Naser's arrival and his all-encompassing resentment towards Anon. Rosa's fury reached its peak when Stella repeated all of the terrible things the pterodactyl shouted in his anger. \n\n   By the time Anon and Stella finished their tale, Rosa looked like she was ready to march out of the room to personally hunt down Naser and bring upon him the wrath of her dreaded chancla. Stella looked just as keen to bring down fire and fury upon Naser, her previous sadness now turning into a fiery sense of righteous wrath that the human couldn't deny made him\u2014for lack of a better term and most certainly taking the word from much smarter and funnier men than he was\u2014scaroused. The absurdity of having two pissed-off girls who had admitted to having once liked him as more than a friend ready and willing to go on a warpath on his behalf wasn't at all lost on him, and it only compounded his confusion and guilt. Regardless of what either Stella or Rosa thought on the matter, Anon felt he deserved every bit of Naser's wrath. Of course, he would have an easier time convincing a brick wall to move aside than convincing either of the former Volcano High garden club leaders that Naser was in the right for being so furious. Anon couldn't help but sigh in frustration. 'So much for keeping my head low and living the rest of my life as the pariah, I really am...'\n\n   Both Rosa and Stella turned to look at Anon, their eyes filled with a mixture of righteous fierceness and deep solicitude. \"We're gonna go find Naser and give him \u00a1La chancletada de su vida!\" \n\n   \"Oui!\" Stella added in her native French. \"He's soon going to learn what it means to mess with team Fleuriste!\"\n\n   Rosa turned to look at Stella with a slight frown. \"Team Fleuriste? No, no, no! That just won't do!\"\n\n   Stella deflated somewhat at hearing her friend's comment, reminding Anon of the times when he had called the lime stego a weirdo. 'Something I never really apologized for and probably should,' Anon embarrassingly thought, making a mental note for later. \n\n   \"What's wrong with Team Fleuriste?\" Stella asked meekly. \"It's a catchy name, and it fits us to a T since we're florist and whatnot.\"\n\n   \"Yeah, but that's exactly why it doesn't work,\" Rosa retorted, putting a hand on Stella's shoulder in a show of support. \"If we're going to have a team name, it has to be something that tells people '\u00a1Cuidado! \u00a1No te metas con esas chicas!'\"\n\n   Stella put her hands behind her back and under her tail in contemplation. \"I guess that is a good point...\" She set her light blue eyes on her friend's ruby eyes. \"I did think of using the name 'Stardust Crusaders,' but that would be... maybe a bit too flashy?\"\n\n   Rosa snorted out a laugh. \"That sounds like the name of an awful eighty's hair metal band.\"\n\n   \"Actually, it's from this one show called JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,\" Stella added excitedly. \"It's really cool and I think you would like it!\"\n\n   Rosa raised an eyebrow. \"JoJo? \u00bfQue tipo de nombre estupido es ese?\"\n\n   \"Actually, I'll have you know that it's an epic seven-part story abo\u2014\"\n\n   \"\u00a1Enfocate!\" Rosa shouted, curring Stella off much to Anon's endless gratitude. \"We are not using 'Stardust Crusaders' for our team name!\"\n\n   Stella puffed her cheeks and crossed her arms. \"Fine. What's your suggestion then?\" \n\n   The ankylosaur tapped her chin in contemplation for five seconds before snapping her fingers and smirking. \"Team '\u00a1Tres Estrellas!'\" Rosa almost yelled out, all the while flexing her arm with a wide grin on her lips.\n\n   Anon, with a raised eyebrow, was the one to speak this time. \"Team 'Three Stars'?\" he asked in a deadpan tone. \"What does that even imply?\" \n\n   Rosa, smiling broadly, turned to face Anon. \"Si!\" she replied, all the while still fleshing her arm. \"There are tres people here: Me, Stella, and you. One star for each of us!\n\n   Anon put a hand on the bridge of his nose. \"Please tell me this isn't a reference to\u2014\"\n\n   \"Dragon Ball Zeta!\" Rosa practically roared, interrupting Anon's words. \n\n   On hearing Rosa's explanation why she wanted to use the name 'three stars' for their hypothetical team, Anon very much wanted to unhook the IV still attached to his arm and use it as a makeshift noose. 'As if one weeb wasn't enough, now I find out that Rosa of all people likes DBZ...' The human then paused for a second as realization hit him and chuckled once he really gave it a good think-over. Of course, Rosa would share at least one interest with Stella, and DBZ was unequivocally popular in Latin countries. Even so, he never pegged the orange florist for being a big enough fan to reveal her power level so casually. 'Learn something new every day, I guess,' Anon thought, wondering just what other revelation he would be witness to that day...\n\n   Just then, and almost as if his thoughts tempted some sort of mischievous trickster god out to make everyone's life all the more confusing, Naser opened the door and stepped into the room. As he did, he again fixed Anon with a glare. Yet, it was nowhere near as nasty as it had been earlier. It felt forced, like something he struggled to maintain despite his mind and spirit being in entirely different places.\n\n   Stella wasted no time in once again stepping in front of Naser's sight, almost as if the presence of her actuality would somehow keep Naser from recognizing Anon was even lying on the bed. Rosa, meanwhile, turned beet red as she marched up to the pterodactyl and looked up into his eyes with a scornful glower that embodied the old saying, 'if looks could kill...'\n\n   Naser let out a scoff as he returned the orange dino's death glare. \"Good to see you too, Rosa.\"\n\n   Rosa responded to Naser's words with a slap across his face, the speed and fierceness of the blow causing the ptero to stagger back as he put a hand on his cheek. \"\u00a1Eso es por lastimar a Anon,\" Rosa hissed through clenched teeth.\n\n   Naser, after recovering some of his composure, glowered at Rosa before allowing himself an exhale. He then straightened his posture and adjusted his white coat. \"Okay. I deserved that,\" he muttered just loud enough for everyone present in the room to hear. \"Glad to know you're still as fit as I remember,\" the dino addressed Rosa with a mixture of sentimentality and comfort. He turned to face Stella, a tiny grin forming on his lips. \"My guess is that you also want to hit me.\"\n\n   \"I'm VERY tempted to!\" Stella snapped at Naser, her body refusing to budge from her defensive position over Anon's bed.\n\n   As he turned to look between Stella and Rosa, Naser couldn't help but feel great resentment. He turned his full attention to Rosa, who he viewed as the more physically imposing of the trio in the room. \"Why are you taking Anon's side,\" he asked, his voice astringent yet shockingly lax despite the current situation. \"You know very well what he did.\"\n\n   Rosa rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. \"Si. I know what happened between Anon and Fang. Y si, I know exactly what it led up to.\"\n\n   Naser's brow furrowed as he took a step closer towards Rosa. \"If you know the truth, then why in the name of Raptor Jesus are you protecting him?\"\n\n   \"Because...\" Rosa started, giving Anon a glance before turning her attention back on Naser. \"...Because I believe in An-On!\" the ankylosaur said as she took a step forward, all the while keeping her glare squarely on her former classmate. \"Because he's suffered just as much as you have. Because despite having a ticket to anywhere in the world, he came back to us!\"\n\n   \"So he returned to the scene of his crime! That doesn't mean he's sorry or that he's changed!\"\n\n   \"\u00bfY tu que sabes sobre cambio?\" Rosa asked at the top of his lungs.\n\n   Naser paused his thoughts in his tracks as Rosa's question pierced through all his mental defenses. Try as he might, the question rattled in his head as he the pterosaur tried\u2014and failed\u2014to plan some sort of retort. \n\n   He had changed, yes, but for all the worst reasons... \n\n   The once bright and all-around honor student of Volcano High had forced himself to become a friendless, spite-fueled doctor who took the first job that he could in Volcadra Bluffs not because it was what he wanted, but because it was what he felt he needed to do. Whereas he would have once gone for a higher sense of purpose with his career, he instead settled for the bare minimum, not caring that refusing to chase the greatness that so many had once seen in him killed his very soul. And what was worse, the anger and hatred of Anon\u2014someone he had once considered a good friend\u2014drove him to consider breaking his oath as a doctor... \n\n   Was that all that he really was? A bitter man willing to throw anything and everything away in search of revenge that at best would prove hollow and at worst would leave him no better than Anon was?\n\n   \"I... I...\" Naser mumbled as he attempted to form words in his mouth. With a grunt, he turned away from everyone's eyes and hit the nearest wall with his fist. The ptero then hit the wall again and then a third time. When he moved to hit the wall a fourth time, he abruptly stopped and let his first hover over the wall for a second before opening up his palm and placing his open hand on the wall. Less than a second later, he let his whole body sag.\n\n   Naser suddenly felt a hand rest upon his shoulder. Naser perked his head and glanced at the extremity placed upon his being, expecting it to be orange or lime-green in tone. Instead, it was pink and distinctively scaleless.\n\n   Slowly, the ptero turned to face the owner of the hand, who was none other than Anon. Despite still being weak of body and sporting a battered, bandaged face, the human had risen from his bed, IV stand in hand and a look that held so many emotions contained within\u2014from sorrow, to understanding, to grim determination\u2014and had walked up to the one person in the world that had both the strength and desire to kill him.\n\n   \"Naser...\" Anon started in as gentle a voice as he could summon. \"I... I know I don't deserve to speak to you...\" he glanced towards Rosa and Stella, both of whom stood by with stunned looks on their faces. \"I don't deserve to direct even a single word at any of you...\" he turned back to face Naser, all the while maintaining his hand on his shoulder. \"...But I have to say this...\"\n\n   Naser said nothing to the human, only fixing him with a tired glare.\n\n   Anon took a deep breath and grimly looked on at his former classmate and friend. \"I... I know I fucked up. Fucked up real bad. I know what I did to your sister that night led to so many people losing their way... and not a single day has passed by since then that I don't regret my choice to run away from the world like a bitch...\" The human removed his hand from the ptero's shoulder. \"I'm... I'm done running. I'm done hiding and letting life pass me by because I'm a little cowardly bitch who can own up to his mistakes as a man would. I know my word probably means little to you... but I can at the very least promise that I'll find a way to set it all right. Even if it means I have to sacrifice everything I have left, I WILL fix my fuck-up...\"\n\n   Naser looked deep into Anon's eyes. At first, he was convinced the human was playing some kind of joke on him; that he was lying to find another way to hurt him more. But the deeper the dino gazed into the human's eyes, the more evident it became that Anon wasn't lying...\n\n   The pterosaur let out another bitter chuckle and he stepped back from the human and right into the wall. \"Anon... your promise doesn't even matter...\" tears shimmered in Naser's eyes as he began taking uneven and raspy breaths. \"Fang's... gone. No one's seen them... in four years. I... I don't even know if they are still alive...\" \n\n   At Anon's words, the dam finally broke for Naser. A bitter waterfall began streaming down the ptero's face, one whose flow he couldn't halt no matter how many times he wiped his eyes. As the dino stared into the human's eyes, his expression changed from grief to wrath, to confusion, and finally into a near-incomprehensible rage. Almost instinctually, and without any warning, the ptero reached up for Anon's throat, both hands wrapping themselves around the human's neck and squeezing down with such intensity that the skin slowly began turning purple. \n\n   Stella and Rosa's very breath left their lungs as they saw Naser's actions. The two began rushing forward, only to stop when they saw Anon gazing on at them shaking his head despite the tears of agony forming in his eyes\u2026\n\n   Naser's lips turned into a grin as he began squeezing tighter and tighter. He had the hated human where he wanted him, his hands slowly and painfully squeezing the life out of his hated enemy. 'Fang, this is for you. Your big brother's going to get payback for you. This is what you'd want...' \n\n   '...Right...?'\n\n   Naser's mind stopped for a second as his own words rebounded within his skull. Little by little, he realized where his hands were and what he was doing, at which point another voice, one far older and wiser than his, echoed in his mind...\n\n   *'Share your knowledge, support the unwell and downtrodden, and do no harm.'*\n\n   'Do no harm,' Naser thought to himself as he looked down at his hands still gripped around Anon's neck. \"Do no harm...\" he whispered just barely audibly enough for both his ears and Anon's. The ptero looked up at the human's eyes, only to realize they were slowly rolling upwards into the back of his eye sockets. He was so close. Just another squeeze and Anon's neck would snap...\n\n   Realization hit Naser like a bag of bricks, and his hateful rage turned to shame. 'I'm killing Anon...' he thought as more tears formed in his eyes. 'I'm... I'm killing my old friend...'\n\n   Naser released Anon from his grip and put his hands on the human's shoulders. Anon, meanwhile, breathed a great sigh of relief as he tried his best not to cough away the pain in his neck. The ptero slowly looked up into the human's eyes again, a stinging smile plastered on his lips. It seemed as if he needed to say something... but whatever those words may have been, they were lost when he began sobbing. A full minute passed with the dino neither able to speak or stop crying. Only when the ptero felt he had expunged every last tear in his system, he patted Anon on the shoulder and began walking towards the door. \"I'm a failure. As a man, a brother, and a friend,\" he whispered without so much as meeting anyone's gaze. \"I'm... sorry. For... everything...\"\n\n   Anon ran a hand over the quickly bruising spot on his neck and put on a determined face. \"Naser!\" he called out just as the ptero reached for the door. \"Fang is alive.\"\n\n   Naser stopped in his tracks and slowly turned to face Anon with eyes open wide. \"W-what d-did you say?\" he wearily asked in a coarse voice.\n\n   \"Fang is alive,\" Anon repeated, his own voice turning raspy. \"I saw them two weeks ago. They're still in Volcadera Bluffs. Somewhere.\"\n\n   Naser put a hand over his mouth and staggered backward once again. The moment he hit a solid surface, he began sliding down onto the floor. Thirty seconds went by where the entire room was silent except for the sound of Naser's heart furiously beating. Then, very gently, the pterodactyl began to chuckle. It was quiet and faint at first, but gradually, the laughter turned louder and more ardent. In the expanse of thirty seconds, the dino laugher turned to bewailings. Unlike his last cries, though, there was a hint of joy in these new sounds. Perhaps the first bit of genuine joy he had experienced over the previous four years. Before he could stop himself, Naser broke into full-on wails. \n\n   Naser\u2019s howls weren't those of sorrow or defeat or incredible loss, however..."},"A Better End Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Multiple","A Better End Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"   Chapter 4 - The Chariot\n\n   \u201cLucy\u2019s alive\u2026\u201d Naser told himself for what must have been the hundredth time that morning. \u201cShe\u2019s... alive\u2026 h-holy shit\u2026\u201d \n\n   The young doctor barely got any sleep last night. The news of his sister\u2019s continuance made sure of that. At most, he got maybe an hour\u2019s worth of slumber in his office before the restlessness snapped him back into the waking world. Since then, he had wandered the halls of the hospital like a specter, occasionally doing the work expected of him as a physician but mostly hovering somewhere between lucidity and unclarity. As night turned to dawn, he had found his mind wandering too much. Grabbing several cups worth of espresso, he had excused himself to the hospital\u2019s rooftop to get fresh air and hopefully get his thoughts back on track. Unfortunately for him, fresh air brought him neither peace nor clarity of mind. The coffee kept him wide awake, yes, but wakefulness proved to be more a curse than a blessing.\n\n   Naser walks past the small communal area used by patients and staff alike, past the helicopter landing pad used for the offloading of critically injured patients or the occasional CEO visiting them, and towards one of the edges overlooking the city of Volcaldera. Downing the last of his espresso and crushing the paper cup in his hand, and letting it get carried off by the wind, the ptero cast his gaze towards the cityscape. As he did, he feels his brows crease as something in his chest starts to burn. \u201cShe\u2019s out there somewhere,\u201d he whispers, grabbing the railing with both hands and grasping the metal with enough force to make his knuckles go white. \u201cShe\u2019s out there\u2026 and only Anon knows where\u2026\u201d He shuts his eyes, grits his teeth, and hisses furiously as his grip on the rails tightens. \u201cANON!!\u201d he screams at the top of his lungs.\n\n   Naser breathes raggedly as he allows the anger in him to bubble over. For a moment, he expects to think of terrible things to do to the caveman who had caused him and his family so much vexation for four years. But as he feels the anger boil again, Naser realizes that his rage isn\u2019t aimed at his former friend...\n\n   Naser lets go of the railing and brings his shaky hands up to his eyes. In his palms, he can still feel the memory of Anon\u2019s smooth skin pressed against his scales as his digits wrapped around his once good friend\u2019s neck, squeezing to snuff out his life. The shame grows again in the ptero\u2019s heart as he realizes how close and how willing he had been to kill his old friend. The guilt only grows as he remembers that he is supposed to be the very antithesis of death. His hands were pledged to protect and nurture life, not take it away...\n\n   \u2018What kind of doctor am I?\u2019 Naser woefully ponders as he shuffles towards the nearest bench. As he takes a seat, he shifts his thoughts away from his attempted malpractice. Instead, he focuses on the good that had come out of the ordeal and the reason why even if he was still angry at Anon, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to hate him anymore\u2026\n\n   \u2018Lucy. He saw her. He confirmed she\u2019s still kicking. After all these years, she's still alive\u2026\u201d He whispers, a smile spreading across his lips as tears once again well in his eyes. Sweet memories of his sister\u2019s antics play in his mind as the young doctor does his best to every good time he shared with Lucy. He stops himself before the bad memories can fully flow. He wants only to feel the joy of that moment, even if a big part of his soul\u2019s telling him that he doesn\u2019t deserve it. \n\n   Not after\u2026\n\n   \u201cDoctor Naser. There you are.\u201d a voice snaps the young ptero out of his thoughtfulness before the bad memories can take complete control over him. \u201cBeen looking all over the hospital for you,\u201d Director Joshua, Volcadera Bluffs General\u2019s head doctor, and Naser\u2019s topmost boss says before walking up to greet his junior. He hasn\u2019t taken more than a dozen steps before he notices Naser\u2019s troubled expression. Soon as he does, he slows his pace and takes a deep breath. \n\n   Without saying a word, he walks past his junior. He turns his attention to admiring the morning scenery on the horizon instead. \u201cBeautiful morning we\u2019re experiencing today, aren\u2019t we?\u201d He asks in a melodious, sagely tone.\n\n   \u201cYes, Mr. Joshua,\u201d Naser says before letting out a sniff and wiping his eyes clear. He then takes a deep breath and slaps himself on the cheeks to psyche himself up.\n\n   The elder archelon nods as he turns to face Naser. \u201cYou holding up okay?\u201d he asks in as gentle a voice as he can muster.\n\n   Naser nods and smiles at his boss. \u201cI\u2026 I just had a rough night.\u201d\n\n   \u201cSo I hear,\u201d Doctor Joshua replies as he walks up to stand right beside Naser\u2019s bench. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d he asked, pointing to the spot next to the ptero.\n\n   Naser shakes his head and scoots over, giving his boss more than enough room to take a seat.\n\n   \u201cYou didn\u2019t go home last night at all, did you?\u201d\n\n   \u201cN-no,\u201d Naser answers intermittently.\n\n   \u201cWere you that worried about your brother?\u201d The director asks, all the while smiling warmly at Naser. \u201cHe should be well and ready to be dismissed later today if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d\n\n   Naser nods and tries to give his boss a warm and confident smile. Instead, he finds his lips unable to maintain any sort of smile for more than a few seconds.\n\n   Doctor Joshua sighs and removes his glasses, bringing out a small handkerchief and proceeding to wipe his glasses clean. \u201cSomething else\u2019s on your mind, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the elder dino asks as he continues wiping the lenses of any blemishes.\n\n   Naser shuts his eyes and stands up from the bench. The mixture of excitement, regret, joy, and sorrow almost causes his body to go haywire.\n\n   \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Joshua. It\u2019s just that I\u2026 I recently found out from none other than my b-brother that my\u2014our\u2014sister\u2026 is still alive!\u201d\n\n   Dr. Joshua\u2019s eyes lit up with genuine excitement. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news!\u201d\n\n   Naser rubs his head and begins pacing back and forth impatiently. \u201cYes, absolutely wonderful\u2026 except that I haven\u2019t seen her in four years, a-and we didn\u2019t leave on the best of terms\u2026 and also our parents may or may not hate us for\u2026\u201d Naser stops at that thought and grabs his head with both hands, all the while letting out a groan of pain. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to feel right now! I want to be ecstatic that a family member I was convinced was dead for the last four years is alive. At the same time, I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s been up to or if she even remembers me or if she WANTS to remember me. There\u2019s also the problem that only my brother knows where she is, and we have to go and find her, and then our parents will get involved and who knows how they\u2019ll react a\u2014\u201d\n\n   \u201cDoctor Naser,\u201d Director Joshua snaps in a stern yet comforting voice. \u201cYou are making a mountain out of a molehill here. You have to relax, take a deep breath, and roll with the punches that life\u2019s dealing you.\u201d He stands and walks up to the young doctor, all the while looking deep into his eyes with a wisdom that only decades of life experience can bring. \u201cPart of living is learning how to adapt to all the surprises life brings us.\u201d he puts a hand on the young ptero\u2019s shoulder and gives him a sage grin. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to work hard, adapt where necessary, and never give up on yourself and those you care about, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t achieve.\u201d   \n\n   The elder dino taps Naser on the shoulder a few times before walking past him. Naser follows his boss with his gaze, the archelon's words ringing in his head and helping dispel much of his previous unease.\n\n   \u201cDoctor Naser,\u201d Director Joshua suddenly starts, snapping the young ptero\u2019s attention back to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a rough time with your brother and now with your sister by the sounds of it. So after you complete this morning\u2019s tasks and discharge your sibling, I\u2019m giving you the rest of the week off, barring an extreme emergency, of course.\u201d\n\n   \u201cW-what?\u201d Naser stutters his question, completely dumbfounded by his boss\u2019 words.\n\n   Director Joshua only guffaws at his junior's reaction. \u201cGo help your brother. Reconcile with your sister. Get some actual sleep and stop drinking so much espresso. That stuff\u2019s not good for you young'uns,\u201d the elder dino commands, all the while adjusting his glasses.\n\n   \u201cBu-but\u2014\u201d\n\n   Director Joshua raises a hand, stopping Naser\u2019s words before he can fully form them. \u201cDoctor\u2019s orders,\u201d he says before allowing himself another hearty laugh. \u201cNow, if you excuse me, I have a nice hearty breakfast with the missus waiting for me. See you in a week!\u201d\n\n   Naser can only watch in utter dumbfoundment as his boss leaves the roof the same way he had come.\n\n   Perhaps for the first time in the last day and a half, Naser felt what he needed to do next. His emotions weren\u2019t all settled yet, but he at least knew with which foot he needed to start walking.\n\n   That was far more than he\u2019d known in the last four years. \n\n \n\n   A few hours after his rooftop situation, Naser walks down the hospital hall. As he does, he looks down at the clipboard in his hand. He scans the name printed in the standard type-font Volcaldera General used on all their paperwork: \n\n   \u2018Anon Y. Mous - Discharge approved by Dr. Naser Aaran.\u2019 \n\n   The pterodactyl can hardly still believe where he was going and for what purpose. He hated Anon\u2019s guts a day prior and wanted nothing more than to strangle him and leave him dead in some ditch somewhere. \n\n   Of course, it was a morbid form of thinking, one that a doctor shouldn\u2019t even consider in the first place. \u201cSo stop thinking like that,\u201d Naser snaps at himself during a rare moment when there aren\u2019t other members of his hospital\u2019s staff within earshot. \u201cFocus on the here and now.\u201d\n\n   The here and now\u2026 now that was another can of worms Naser still can\u2019t wrap his head around. Barely one week back in Volcaldera, and he had already found the person that for the last four years had kept the fire of hate burning in his soul. Yet not one day after meeting him, all of that hate had been snuffed out at the revelation that person had brought with them...\n\n   Naser still wanted to hate Anon. A part of him felt like he needed that hate to keep going, much like how a junkie needs their next hit of drugs. Yet, just like an addict, breaking the dependency was the best thing to do. In his case, letting go of the hate had led to him seeing things differently. Now for the first time in what felt like forever, he felt a sense of hope. That absolution could be around the corner. It still didn\u2019t change the fact that he found his situation surreal... like something out of a Twilight Zone episode.\n\n   Naser picks up his pace and reaches Anon\u2019s room. Without so much as a knock, he opens the door and walks in. Thankfully for Naser, Anon\u2019s already dressed in the same attire he was found in, only clean of filth. The only sign left on the human now that showed he had suffered physical harm were the white bandages dotted across his face.  \n\n   On seeing the human wearing his plain black turtleneck, navy blue pants, and black wool beanie, Naser can't help but feel a sense of longing for the old. Somehow, he imagined that Anon would still be wearing the same outfit he had donned in high school, even four years later. Seeing his new wardrobe was a sobering reminder of how long a time four years were. At the same time, he also wondered if Anon\u2019s spartan fashion style resulted from his time in the navy or if it was personal taste.\n\n   Naser walked up to the caveman and fixed him with his most professional gaze. Last he checked, he was still a doctor, even if he had come dangerously close to throwing all that away a day earlier. Whatever other feelings he might have for the human still, he was now his physician first and foremost.\n\n   \u201cWell, Anon, aside from the lacerations to your face, you're fully detoxed and have suffered no permanent brain damage. That means that as your physician, I can officially discharge you\u2026 on the condition that you don\u2019t drink or smoke or do anything stupid, harmful, or stupidly harmful to yourself for at least a month.\u201d\n\n   Naser finishes his word in stunned surprise. He had expected his every word to taste like vile, but now that he was more or less on good terms with Anon, it felt like he was trying to care for an old friend. Granted, the human was an old friend. It so happened that he did something that he found unforgivable. But whatever beef he might still have with the petite caveman no longer mattered. Anon had given him hope of seeing his little sister again. Hope he had all but given up on years ago.\n\n   Despite being given the go-ahead to leave, Anon couldn\u2019t find it in himself to move an inch. Something kept his feet rooted to the ground. It was almost as if some invisible weight still lingered over him. He reaches into his pocket to instinctively search for a cigarette, only to realize that he has none on his person. He can\u2019t help but grumble at his little blunder, his shoulders dropping and his brow furrowing in mild agitation.\n\n   Naser takes notice and raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n   Anon sighs. \u201cI\u2019m so used to smoking away what ails me that not being able to\u2026 fucking sucks.\u201d\n\n   Naser lets out a single chuckle and puts the clipboard under his arm. \u201cCry me a river,\u201d Naser replies with a mocking grin. \u201cI\u2019m surprised we didn\u2019t find lung cancer or some other fucked up shit in you after all those years of smoking and drinking.\u201d\n\n   Anon lets out a grumble, his disposition dropping further. \u201cI\u2019ve only been smoking hard for the last few weeks. Fucking navy doesn\u2019t allow smoking on their ships, especially the warships.\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s eyes broadened. \u201cSo you were stationed on a legit warship? And here I thought you wound up in some dinghy.\u201d\n\n   Anon shakes his head. \u201cI wish. I wound up in an aircraft carrier. I spent most of my days around live munitions and jet fuel.\u201d The human put on an exhausted smile. \u201cYou can imagine what would have happened if I smoked around that?\u201d\n\n   Naser has a few flashes to old WW2 movies he saw when he was younger where ships exploded left and right. It makes him cringe a bit, imagining such fireballs caused by a smoking sailor.\n\n   Putting that image out of his mind, Naser instead turns his thoughts to a question that's been burning him since finding out Anon had joined the navy. \u201cWhat exactly did you do in the navy?\u201d\n\n   Anon fidgets his body around before letting out a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably seen my record by now. Might as well come clean.\u201d He walks up to the sofa chair Stella had been using hours earlier and takes a seat, all the while keeping his eyes square on Naser. \u201cAfter I dropped out of High School, I had no real prospects in life. My dad only paid for the Skin Row apartment for four months extra after I graduated high school. After that, it was either college or the service. Since I dropped out, I naturally chose the service.\u201d\n\n   \u201cWhy the navy, though?\u201d Naser asks.\n\n   \u201cBecause the navy was the only armed branch that was willing to give a high school dropout like me a chance. Also, a lot of the ships want small-stature people. Me being a literal runt of a human was perfect for \u2018em.\u201d Anon bitterly laughs as he stretches his arms upwards. \u201cAlso, the navy got me the fuck out of Volcaldera. I was at boot camp within the week. After surviving that wonderful experience, I was stuffed into a carrier and sent to sail the seas for four years. It would have been five had it not been for my accident on those stairwells.\u201d\n\n   \u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me what you did in the navy,\u201d Naser comments impatiently.\n\n   Anon grimaces and shoots a glare towards Naser. \u201cI\u2019m getting there. I\u2019m getting there!\u201d He let out a snort and continued. \u201cAnyway. Once I was a full-fledged seaman\u2014don\u2019t you dare fucking laugh!\u2014\u201d Anon barks and points a finger towards Naser, who only raises a hand in a sign of peace \u201c\u2014I joined the PACT program so I could get myself some engineering know-how. Aside from that, they taught me a bunch of other stuff you\u2019d expect to learn on a warship: munition loading, electrical know-how, survival training, physical conditioning, and over a hundred ways to clean a ship with only a toothbrush and seawater.\" \n\n   \"That sounds...\" Naser started but found he had no accurate quip regarding that last thing Anon mentioned. \"...Interesting,\" he only said before shaking his head. \n\n   Anon let out another chuckle. \"The one thing I didn\u2019t expect to learn was the glorious art of CQC. Guess they wanted us fit and ready to fight off pirates or some bullshit like that.\u201d\n\n   \u201cCQC?\u201d Naser asks.\n\n   \u201cClose Quarter Combat,\u201d Anon replies with yet another tired sigh. \u201cHow to fight hand to hand and with certain tools like knives. If you\u2019ve seen MMA, it\u2019s kinda like that, only a hell of a lot less flashy and more deadly.\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s eyes swell again. \u201cWait a second then,\u201d he looks at Anon with a bewildered stare. \u201cAre telling me that back when I was\u2026 strangling you, you could\u2019ve\u2014\u201d\n\n   \u201c\u2014Reversed your choke and snapped your neck several dozen ways? Probably,\u201d Anon finishes Naser\u2019s words with a bitter grin on his lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t because\u2026 a part of me knew I deserved that strangling. Plus\u2026\u201d Anon looks at Naser with a soft gaze. \u201cI\u2026 I guess I trusted you enough not to kill me.\u201d\n\n   Naser blinks a few times, almost as if his brain was having a hard time processing the information it had received.\n\n   \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Anon suddenly asks, breaking his train of thought. \u201cWhat has the prodigal son of the Aaran\u2019s been up to these last four years?\u201d\n\n   Naser visibly flinches at Anon\u2019s words, but he does his best to keep a scowl from forming on his face. \u201cI went straight to medical school as soon as I graduated. I didn\u2019t give myself any breaks or anything.\u201d\n\n   Anon raises an eyebrow and lets out a whistle. \u201cDamn, and here I thought you\u2019d propose to Naomi or something. How\u2019s she, by the way?\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s expression darkens. His only reply is to look down to the floor.\n\n   Anon catches the mood right away and shakes his head. \u201cFuck. That bad, huh?\u201d\n\n   \u201cNaomi and I\u2026\u201d Naser starts but stops himself. He takes a deep breath and forces a smirk on his lips. \u201cNaomi and I went our separate ways shortly after graduation.\u201d\n\n   Anon raised an eyebrow in response. \u201cShe dumped you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n   Naser puts a hand on his face and shakes his head. \u201cDamn\u2026 Is it that obvious?\u201d\n\n   Anon shrugs and gives his old friend a warm yet sour smile. \u201cA bit. Though I\u2019m mostly going by the fact that Naomi was a bitch.\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s surprised to hear the words come out of Anon\u2019s mouth. A part of him wants to punch the human for even daring to say such a thing about his ex, but deep down, he knows his old friend\u2014turned one-sided enemy, and now back to a friend\u2014is correct.\n\n   Anon leans back on his chair and lets out a chuckle. \u201cDid you know that Naomi tried to set Fang and me up back in the day?\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s shoulders slump a bit at Anon\u2019s words. Some part of him had always suspected, but he never dared to accept it for fear of what it would mean. But hearing it from Anon all but made it an irrefutable fact, and it stung at his soul.\n\n   \u201cI\u2026 I guess I suspected it\u2026\u201d Naser answers meekly.\n\n   \u201cNaomi thought that if Fang and I dated, your sister would magically get \u2018fixed\u2019 of all her problems or some idiotic bullcrap that only Naomi could think up. Barring that, that our dating would keep Fang from bothering you so much. That bitch Naomi could then have you all to herself to do as she pleased.\u201d Anon sat back up and looked at Naser with sunken, tired eyes. \u201cToo bad she picked me to date your sister. I was probably the worst person she could have chosen for the job..\u201d\n\n   Naser wanted to say something in rebuttal to Anon\u2019s words, but harsh as they were, his words rang true. Naomi had shown her true colors in the end, and everyone fell into her ploy without any means of seeing the truth until it was far too late. Anon may have been responsible for breaking Fang\u2019s heart, but that only happened because Naomi forced them together in the first place. Still, as bad as things got in the end for them, Naser knew that Anon and Fang had shared a connection. They had enjoyed good times and had made each other happy. At least before their apocalyptic break-up. \n\n   While Naser didn\u2019t believe in multiple universes, he hoped to god that there was a reality out there where everything turned out alright and that Anon and Lucy had found some semblance of a happily ever after...\n\n   The room goes quiet for about a full minute. After that minute passes, Naser walks up to the now-empty medical bed and sits down, setting the clipboard to the side as he staring deep into Anon\u2019s eyes.\n\n   \u201cAnon, I\u2019ve already told you that I believe you about Lucy, but I need to know the truth. Did you really see her a week ago?\u201d\n\n   \u201cYes. I really did.\u201d\n\n   \u201cW-where!?\u201d Naser asks in more of a panic.\n\n   \u201cShe was playing in some shitty pizzeria called \u2018Pizza Time\u2019 back in Skin Row.\u201d\n\n   \u201cW-what did she look like? Was she well-fed? Was she thin? D-did she still have all her extremities attached!?\u201d\n\n   At the question, Anon hesitates. He doesn\u2019t want to break Naser\u2019s spirit any more, but something tells him that lying about Fang\u2019s physical state wouldn\u2019t help anyone. \u2018Naser deserves to know the truth too\u2026\u2019 the human reasons as he decides he\u2019s done keeping things from others.\n\n   \u201cFang, she\u2026 she looked thin. Malnourished, even. She had this gaunt look to her like the last four years have worn down her spirit to the point where she\u2019s more of an automaton animated by neurotransmitters than a person...\u201d Anon sighs as the bitter memories of the day he had failed for the second time in his life flood back in. \u201cShe\u2026 she literally looked right through me, as if I wasn\u2019t even there, and I was sitting so close to that stage\u2026\u201d He gives Naser a look full of regret. \u201cI\u2026 know I said she was still alive, but the way she looked\u2026 I would say that only applies to her physically\u2026\u201d\n\n   Naser Stands up and glares daggers at Anon. For a few moments, the fires of hatred again ignite within the ptero\u2019s soul. For the faintest of moments, he considers cursing out Anon for what he did, how his actions led to Fang\u2019s current state of living death\u2026 but that fire dies as quickly as it ignited as the young doctor remembers Anon\u2019s words the last time they met.\n\n   Instead of punching the human as he originally wanted, Naser winds up grabbing anon by the sides of his shirt and forcing him to stand up, so the two are eye to eye with one another. \n\n   \u201cYou saw Lucy looking like that and just walked away!?\u201d Naser shouts at Anon\u2019s face. \u201cWhat is wrong with you!?\u201d\n\n   Anon shifts his eyes to the side, his expression dropping as he silently agrees with Naser\u2019s assessment of him.\n\n   \u201cW-well!\u201d Naser shouts, all the while shaking Anon. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say!?\u201d \n\n   Naser\u2019s brow only furrows when Anon gives him no answer.\n\n   \u201cNo,\u201d Anon whispers in reply.\n\n   Naser lets go of the human and takes a step back, his eyes shimmering as tears begin welling in them.\n\n   \u201cI know\u2026 that what I did was cowardly,\" Anon finally says as he sets his eyes on his friend's teary gaze. \"I don\u2019t need a reminder of that. I\u2019ve had a whole week to think back on how I once again ran away instead of facing my mistakes like a fucking man. But like I told you, I\u2019m done running, and I\u2019m done being a little bitch about it!\u201d Anon puts a hand on Naser\u2019s shoulder and gives him a dead-serious look. \u201cSoon as I\u2019m out of this hospital, I\u2019m going to go find Fang, and I\u2019m going to do what I should've done a week ago!\u201d\n\n   Naser breathed deep and returned Anon\u2019s intense gaze. \u201cY-you better,\u201d he says with some resentment, yet also with hope.\n\n   Anon tightens his grip on Naser\u2019s shoulder, prompting the ptero\u2019s eyes to widen a bit. \u201cYou should come with me,\u201d the human says, a faint smile forming on his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re Fang\u2019s brother too. She\u2014they\u2014deserve to know that you\u2019re still out here caring about their wellbeing, even after being gone for years.\u201d\n\n   \u201cW-what?\u201d Naser asked, stuttering as his brain tried comprehending Anon\u2019s words.\n\n   \u201cCome with me to Pizza Time or wherever else she\u2019s going to be playing next. We\u2019ll meet her together, and together we\u2019ll let her know that there are people who still care!\u201d Anon put his other hand on Naser\u2019s shoulder and brought him close enough that the two were only inches away from bumping noses. \u201cIf you\u2019re there, you two can reconnect and be family again. I mean, it\u2019s what you want, right?\u201d \n\n   Naser takes a step away from Anon and turns away from the human. As he does, his shoulders sag, and his head slumps forward. Not one second later, the young doctor\u2019s body begins to tremble, almost as if someone turned his blood ice-cold.\n\n   \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can do that, Anon\u2026\u201d\n\n   \u201cWhat?\u201d Anon asks in shock.\n\n   Naser turns around, his eyes now sporting tears ready to roll down his cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do that!\u201d he shouts.\n\n   \u201cWhat\u2019d you mean that you can\u2019t do it?\u201d\n\n   Naser shut his eyes and grits his teeth. \u201cI can\u2019t do it because\u2026 because\u2026\u201d he brings up his sleeve and rubs his eyes before fixing Anon with a glare. \u201cBecause I\u2019m also a fucking coward!\u201d\n\n   Anon doesn\u2019t say anything as Naser tries his best to compose himself, all the while the scowl on his face slowly gives way to a frown full of shame. \u201cI also ran away from everything!\u201d he snaps in a rage that isn\u2019t entirely directed at Anon despite his eyes fixing themselves firmly on the human\u2019s eyes. \u201cI chose to separate myself from this place and everyone I grew up with because I couldn\u2019t handle the stress, the pain, the responsibility that I had to\u2014needed to\u2014find Lucy!\u201d He sniffs and again tries to wipe his eyes clear of tears. \u201cI even turned my back on my parents in their time of greatest need\u2026\u201d He clutched his hands tight, all the while scowling more and more furiously. \u201cHow can I possibly face Lucy when I haven\u2019t even grown the spine to face my own mother and father!?\u201d He slams his fists on Anon\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat kind of brother does that? What kind of person deserves to reconcile with a sibling when he can\u2019t even bring himself to reconcile with his parents!?\u201d  \n\n   Anon\u2019s reminded of Fang\u2019s emotional outburst back on the roof of Volcano High all those years ago. Just like he did then, he keeps his mouth shut. Not because he didn\u2019t have anything to say, he had plenty to. Rather, because something told him that Naser, much like Fang had back then, didn\u2019t need anyone patronizing or to have other's ideals forced upon them. \n\n   Naser needed someone to support him in his greatest time of need.\n\n   \u2018He needs someone better than shitty ol\u2019 me, though,\u2019 Anon thinks as he grapples with what to do next. He knows he\u2019s not the ideal person to be giving support to anyone. But given the lack of people qualified for it, he was the nearest person who realistically could. At the same time, he was also dealing with a person who had thrived off hating him for the last four years. Hell, he had tried to kill him. His sudden change of heart notwithstanding, how did one go about supporting such a person?\n\n   \u2018I guess the first thing he needs to do is bury the hatchet with his parents,\u2019 Anon reasoned. Of course, that was also true about him. It was clear that Fang\u2019s disappearance had also affected the Aarans in ways that younger Anon could have never have hoped to comprehend. Yet apologizing to Fang\u2019s parents was a terrifying prospect. So much so that he would have much preferred to save that particular apology for last, after he hopefully got Fang to be on friendly terms with him at the very least. Yet, with Naser now in the picture and the weight of his baggage, saving that particular apology for later had gone from something that he could put off for later to needing to be done ASAP.\n\n   \u2018Fuck,\u2019 Anon thinks as it slowly dawns on him that there\u2019s no getting around what\u2019s to come. \u2018I don\u2019t think I can do this alone, though\u2026\u2019\n\n   At precisely the moment Anon thought that, the door to the room swung wide, almost as if kicked open. Less than a second later, in pops a lime-yellow stegosaur with a big wide grin on her lips and cheerful glow that bordered on the ludicrous. \n\n   \u201cHoi, Anon! I\u2019m back!\u201d Stella shouts with all the subtlety of an atom bomb. The stego is no longer sporting her previous Natsuki-inspired tracksuit, but rather is back to wearing an outfit that seems to be a direct callback to her high school outfit: black jean shorts slightly longer than her old pair, a white shirt more on the slim-fitting side\u2014which help accentuate the curves and muscles that she\u2019d put on thanks to her cardio workouts over the last few years\u2014and a pair of black and white retro sneakers that probably belonged more in the late 80s or early 90s than the present day, all wrapped under her now trademark twin-bunned lime green hairstyle.\n\n   Both Anon and Naser turn to look at Stella with varying expressions. Naser, for his part, welcomes the sudden shift in the room\u2019s mood, thankful that Stella\u2019s sudden appearance brought about some form of levity to the serious conversation he\u2019d finished having with Anon. \n\n   Anon, on the other hand, can only close his eyes and put a hand over the ridge of his nose. \u2018Stella doesn\u2019t have an off switch, does she?\u2019 he asks himself.\n\n   \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think she does,\u201d Naser answers with a warm smile forming on his lips. \n\n   Anon turns to Naser and gives him a quizzical expression.\n\n   \u201cYou still mumble,\u201d Naser replies matter-of-factly to Anon\u2019s non-verbal question.   \n\n   \u201cOf course I do,\u201d Anon tells himself as he shakes his head in frustration.\n\n   \u201cOf course you what?\u201d Stella asks, stepping into the room and closing the door behind her. \u201cDid I interrupt a live-changing dialogue between you two or something? I-I can wait outside.\u201d\n\n   \u201cYou\u2019re already here,\u201d Naser answers as he takes a step away from Anon, all the while doing his best to bury the previous grief he had brought to bear. \u201cMe and Anon\u2026 we were just talking about\u2026 stuff...\u201d Naser takes a deep breath to steady himself before stuffing a hand into his pants pocket, all the while smiling in feigned confidence. \u201cYou know, catching up and whatnot.\u201d\n\n   Stella\u2019s eyes grow to the size of tea plates. \u201cOh!\u201d she announces as her expression brightens considerably. \u201cThat\u2019s SO good to hear then!\u201d\n\n   \u201cS-Stella,\u201d Anon starts, his full attention finally turning towards the genki dino, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n   Stella raises an eyebrow at the question. \u201cWhat am I doing? I\u2019m here to see you, of course!\u201d\n\n   \u201cI get that much\u2026 but WHY?\u201d Anon asks again, taking a step forward to emphasize his words.\n\n   Stella puts her hands behind her back, the posture once more making her look like she couldn\u2019t be more than a year out of high school. \u201cDo I really need an excuse to check up on someone dear to me?\u201d She asks the human.\n\n   Anon\u2019s only answer is to cross his arms and raise an eyebrow.\n\n   Stella rolls her eyes, puffs her lips, and crosses her arms. \u201cOh fine!\u201d she snaps, turning her gaze towards Naser, her brow furrowing in the process. \u201cI also came here because I heard Naser shouting and was afraid he was trying to strangle you again.\u201d\n\n   Naser rubs the back of his head and gives the anime-loving stego a sheepish grin. \u201cYeah\u2026 that was not my best moment in life\u2026\u201d\n\n   Stella replies to Naser\u2019s words by walking next to Anon and grabbing him by the arm while glaring at the young doctor.\n\n   Naser again sighs and looks away from the two. \u201cI\u2019d really appreciate it if\u2026 if you two would keep the whole... strangulation... situation to yourselves\u2026\u201d\n\n   \u201cOnly if you promise never to do it again!\u201d Stella snaps, her grip on Anon\u2019s arm growing tighter.\n\n   \u201cI-I swear it!\u201d Naser answers with a mixture of fear and shame.\n\n   Stella turns her eyes upwards as she ponders on what to say or do next. \n\n   In the meantime, Anon slips his arm out from Stella\u2019s grip and clears his throat. \u201cAt any rate,\u201d he starts, once more turning to face the ptero. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u2026 about your folks.\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s expression again sours as he\u2019s reminded of his problem. He leans against the nearest wall and ponders on what to do next. So long as he still had the regret of his parents, it would prevent him from facing Lucy. Yet meeting his parents wasn\u2019t a pleasant prospect for him at all. \u2018Especially after I\u2026\u2019\n\n   Naser winces as the memories lash at his being. \u2018No. I can\u2019t face them. Not after I said all those things to them\u2026\u2019\n\n   Stella\u2019s the one to clear her throat this time, causing Anon and Naser to turn their attention to her. As they do, she paces towards the middle of the room to stand facing the two males.\n\n   \u201cThe two of you are at a critical crossroads in your lives,\u201d Stella starts in a voice that Anon recognized as her \u2018mystic\u2019 mode. \u201cAnon,\u201d she says, turning to face the human. \u201cYou know what your destination is, but you don\u2019t know where to begin this journey or if you\u2019ll have the courage to see it through to the end.\u201d The stego turns to face the young doctor. \u201cAnd Naser, you fear the journey\u2019s start because of something you said or did in the past that\u2019s shackling you with fear.\u201d Stella closes her eyes and brings her hands together in what almost looks like a praying motion. \u201cFor the two of you to really heal, you have to take an initial step forward, and that step lies with an apology.\u201d\n\n   Anon and Naser look at each other in confusion. \u201cBut we already buried our respective hatchets,\u201d Naser says matter-of-factly.\n\n   Stella snapped open an eye and looked at Anon and Naser with mild annoyance. \u201cNot an apology to each other, dummies. An apology to the Aarans.\u201d She gives a nod and again crosses her arms behind her back as she opened her eyes and alternated her gaze between human and ptero. \u201cIt\u2019s been four years since the catastrophe with Fang, and since then, they have no doubt been suffering, not just because of their missing daughter, but also because of their wayward son.\u201d She fixes Naser with a serious gaze. \u201cJust like Anon, you left suddenly and without a word. You knew your destination, but you gave no one a roadmap of what roads you would use to get there. Because of that, you might as well have become a ghost. If what I heard is true, you haven\u2019t even kept in contact with your parents in years..\u201d\n\n   Naser\u2019s head dropped as he looked to the floor.\n\n   \u201cAnd Anon,\u201d Stella says next, her full attention turning to the human. \u201cWhile your journey to Fang is more direct, you\u2019re going to have to eventually confront the Aaran\u2019s about your part in their daughter\u2019s disappearance. Thankfully, you have both the conviction and knowledge now to face them with a head held high!\u201d\n\n   Stella gives the pair a warm smile as she reaches into her pocket and pulls out her trusty tarot deck. \u201cRight now, you are a literal hope bringer, Anon. The Aarans think their daughter is dead, but you know the truth, one they deserve to know.\u201d She shuffles her deck expertly, just like she did earlier with Anon, and draws the top card. She holds it facing towards her as her gaze again shifts between Anon and Naser.\n\n   Anon, swallowing a lump that had formed in his throat, looks Stella in the eye. \u201cWhat card is it?\u201d he asks, baffled that he was going along with something he considered to be trashy superstition days earlier.\n\n   Stella puts on a wide simper as she flips the card around, revealing it to Naser and Anon. \u201cUpright chariot!\u201d she cheers as she walks up to Naser and offers him the card.\n\n   Naser, with a shaky hand, takes the card and inspects the art. It depicts what looks to be a T-rex dino with a crown and regal armor atop an opulently ornate chariot. At the head of the chariot, two regal sphinxes, one white and one black, pull the chariot forward, their faces a mixture of human and dino features.\n\n   \u201cThe chariot card signifies that you have some hard work ahead of you,\u201d Stella says, causing Anon and Naser to pay close attention to her. \u201cIt may be resolved quickly, but the labor you are undertaking will probably tend towards the long and difficult. You will quite possibly experience rough roads, long uphill slopes, dead ends, and painful setbacks. This hard road will instill in you a strength of purpose, the ability to succeed through organization and endurance, and confidence possessed only by those who have done what they thought they could not. Harnessed correctly, few forces can stand against individuals like that\u2026\u201d\n\n   Naser once more looks down at the card in his hand. Not once has he ever believed in such occult practices as tarot cards or psychic readings. As a doctor, he believes in the rational and the physical. There is no room in medicine for the supernatural. Yet, something about Stella\u2019s reading filled him with intrigue and purpose. Even if Stella\u2019s reading was nothing but a bunch of smoke and mirrors bull, her words about finding absolution with his parents remained true. Facing his own past mistake and correcting it was the first step towards bettering himself. \n\n   Otherwise, he would wind up living the rest of his life unable to move on... \n\n   While Naser continued to stare at the chariot card with wide eyes, Stella walked right next to Anon again and gave him a toothy smile. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to worry about anything,\u201d she said, all the while jabbing his arm with her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m going to be keeping you company throughout this journey.\u201d\n\n   Anon blinked about five times before realizing what Stella meant by her words. A bead of sweat formed at the idea of having someone tag along with him, especially if that someone had admitted to having liked him in high school a day prior.\n\n   \u201cUh\u2026 isn\u2019t Rosa going to be pissed that you\u2019re not showing up to work?\u201d Anon asks earnestly.\n\n   \u201cOf course, she\u2019d be mad! But she\u2019s also the one who gave me the mission to look out after you. Just in case you decided to beat yourself up again!\u201d she flashes the human a peace sign and gives him a wink.\n\n   Anon rolls his eyes at Stella\u2019s words. \u2018Course, leave it to Rosa to still care about others, even when they weren\u2019t the best of friends towards her in the first place\u2026\u2019 \n\n   \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t all Rosa\u2019s idea, you know,\u201d Stella suddenly replies, her cheeks growing flushed at her words.\n\n   \u2018Damn. Mumbling,\u201d Anon thinks to himself before the total weight of Stella\u2019s words hits him. \n\n   \u201cWait, wait, wait!\u201d Anon snaps, taking a step away from Stella. \u201cYou WILLINGLY offered yourself to be my tail during this whole fiasco?\u201d\n\n   Stella gives Anon a sympathetic ear-to-ear smile. \u201cCourse! You really think I\u2019m going to miss out on an IRL redemption story to rival the Zuko arc?\u201d\n\n   Anon put on a smile as he shook his head and shrugged. Not like it changed anything about his goals. Plus, it would be nice to have the company of a person that never actively hated him to begin with. Especially now that he was going to be walking right into the den of a very angry, very violent pterodactyl... \n\n   Having come to terms with the fact that he had a permanent party member, Anon turned to Naser next. He walked up to the young doctor and put a hand on his shoulder in a show of camaraderie.\n\n   Naser looked up from the card and onto Anon\u2019s eyes with fear at first. Still, slowly, that fear dissolved as newfound determination began to take its place. The young doctor would be lying if he said that his stomach wasn\u2019t filled with ice at the prospect of facing his parents again, but he wouldn\u2019t be doing it alone. Anon was with him, and together the two could face the storm that was approaching.\n\n   Every journey started with a step. This was the first step. The most critical step... \n\n \n\n   It\u2019s several hours later. The sun had long set, and night had brought with it a frigidity uncharacteristic of that time of year in Volcaldera. Naser, Anon, and Stella stand outside of the Aaron residence, a very different expression on each of their faces: Fear, determination, and enthusiasm, respectively. \n\n   As the pale moonlight shines upon the household Naser and Fang once called home, and there is a certain level of anxiety within the human and pterodactyl\u2019s hearts. The last time the two were at the Aaran residence, their respective outlooks on life were brighter. Now the surrounding darkness felt like an apt reflection of what had become of their individual lives. Only the moonlight served as a beacon for what they needed to accomplish next.\n\n   Anon breathed heavily, his body quaking with warranted regret as he remembered his last visit to the Aaran residence. He remembers the faces of Fang\u2019s parents. He remembers the hopeful and sunny disposition of Mrs. Samantha, her joy of knowing her daughter was going to prom almost overwhelming. He remembers Mr. Ripley\u2019s scrutiny over Anon, and his parting words of warning before the human excused himself to \u2018feed\u2019 Metal Gear RAYmba, a lie that he still couldn\u2019t believe had worked. How right Mr. Ripley had been to distrust Anon with his daughter. Even following the old parental stereotype, Anon had proven the ptero patriarch\u2019s worst fears correct.\n\n   Naser, meanwhile, took just as heavy a breath as Anon as he too began remembering the past. His memories were initially good. He remembered getting along well with his parents. He remembered all the good times he had playing with Lucy when they were young. He remembered those carefree days before the accident. Then, his memories sour as he recalls the accident that left his wing crippled. He recalls the dour mood as he felt Lucy\u2019s anguish over her role in the event. How it started her down a dark path of insecurity and self-loathing. How it shaped her life from that moment on, leading to a spiraling of worsening problems as Lucy became Fang, Fang became non-binary, and Fang stopped thinking for herself, instead clinging on to anything and everything Trish told her to do, shaping his sister into something that by the end he could barely recognize as the once cheerful and energetic pirate princess he had grown up around. From there, the memories became bittersweet. He remembers vowing to make up for his sister's faults, excelling not because he wanted to, but rather because he needed to keep his parent\u2019s wrath away from his sister. He remembers meeting Naomi and thinking that she was the one. He reflects on his high school career, joining the track team and rising to become its captain, and his eventual rise to honor student. And, of course, he remembers prom night. How he had expected to see Anon and Lucy there, only to find out later that they never attended. That they instead had their own private prom, after which everything fell apart\u2026\n\n   Naser glanced sideways towards Anon, his brow furrowing and his hands curling into fists. A part of him rightfully wanted to strangle the human again for it as the fire of righteous indignation ignited in his soul once more. But as the young doctor inspected the eyes of his human companion, he too could see the pain that a past full of torment was assaulting him. He sighed, unfurled his fists, and let go of his anger for what felt like the millionth time that day. Anon may have been the cause of four years of pain for him, but he was also the catalyst for his now experiencing change.\n\n   As the anger faded, another memory came to Naser, one he had tried long and hard to suppress. He had no defenses against its overwhelming assault against his heart. How could he fight against it when every fiber of his being told him he shouldn\u2019t?\n\n   Naser takes a step back from his old home, all the while shaking his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispers as he completely turns away from the Aaran residence. \u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t do this\u2026\u201d\n\n   Both Anon and Stella turn to look at their ptero companion with concern. Being the only person whose heart wasn\u2019t burdened by painful memories, Stella walks back and grabs Naser by the arm. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d the stego asks, light-blue eyes scanning the young doctor\u2019s visage for any possible clue. \n\n   Naser shifts his eyes to meet Stella\u2019s gaze. For one moment, he stares deep into those light-blue pools in the hopes of finding some relief from the thorns gripping his heart. After about five seconds, he shuts his eyes tight and janks his arm away from Stella\u2019s grip before slowly shuffling towards the sidewalk\u2019s nearest curb. At this point, he sits down and buries his head in his hands.\n\n   \u201cN-Naser\u2026 you\u2026 you okay?\u201d Anon asks, unsure as to whether or not he should approach his troubled companion.\n\n   Naser slams a fist on the hard concrete and lets out a groan of pain. \u201cNo,\u201d he hisses through clenched teeth. \u201cI\u2026 I thought I could forge through the memories, but I just fucking can\u2019t!\u201d\n\n   \u201cThey can\u2019t be that bad,\u201d Stella says in her best attempt at cheering the ptero.\n\n   \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Naser snaps as he looks up at the moon. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m so fucking afraid of going back home\u2026\u201d He inhales unevenly as he shuts his eyes. \u201c...I said some really fucked up things\u2026 before I left\u2026\u201d\n\n   Naser allows the memories he had so desperately tried to suppress overcome his being, sending him back to what was perhaps the worst single night of his life\u2026\n\n \n\n   -Four Years Earlier-\n\n   Almost a month has passed since Lucy ran away from home. Dad turned all of Volcaldera upside down in search of her\u2014them\u2014I honestly don\u2019t even fucking know anymore. All I know is that ever since Lucy up and left, everything's gone to shit. \n\n   Graduation is only days away, yet I can\u2019t feel any joy about it. How can I when my sister\u2019s fucking gone missing? Even worse, dad won\u2019t shut up about how this is all my fault. Doesn\u2019t he know that I did everything that I could to keep Lucy on the straight and narrow? It\u2019s not my fault that she went and got herself indoctrinated into that enby bullshit by Trish. Not my fault she ended dating some deadbeat asshole that broke her heart... It\u2019s not my\u2026\n\n   Fuck. Fuck you, Anon. Seriously. FUCK. YOU. You were my friend. You were Lucy\u2019s friend. I thought you could be the one to pull her out of her rut finally. To give her the support she deserved and that I obviously couldn\u2019t provide. I fucking TRUSTED you! Instead, you turned out to be another asshole in a very long line of assholes I seem to be surrounded by...  \n\n   Fuck... even Naomi, the girl I thought would stick by me for the rest of my days, dumped my sorry ass. She didn\u2019t even give me a good reason. She only said that I had changed and that our relationship wasn\u2019t going to work out anymore. That I wasn't good enough for her either and that we were better off seeing others more like each other...\n\n   Well, of course I fucking changed! My sister\u2019s fucking gone missing! Did she expect me to laugh it off like it's nothing? Like this is another one of Lucy\u2019s personality reinventions? Fuck, for all I know, Lucy's probably dead by now. I mean, no one vanishes for close to a month without leaving some trace behind. I mean, for fuck\u2019s sake, dad\u2019s the police commissioner! He moved earth and sky and brought in every possible resource to search for Lucy, and even then, he found no trace of her anywhere! And who does he blame? Me, of course. Only Naser, the perfect son of the Aaran family... \n\n   Well, I\u2019m done getting blamed. I\u2019m done with everyone looking at me like I could have prevented this bullshit. I\u2019m done with Trish yelling at me like I was supposed to know that Anon was bad news. I\u2019m done having to endure Reed\u2019s look of distant disappointment every time our eyes meet. I\u2019m done taking my mother\u2019s silent judgment over my inability to keep my sister from vanishing. I\u2019m done bearing principal spear\u2019s stoic gaze of dissatisfaction.\n\n   I Am. Fucking. Done!\n\n   I slam shut my suitcase with as much force as I can before picking it up. I give my room one last look before turning around and storming out of the door. If I stay there another second, I will wuss out and not go through with it. I honestly can\u2019t think of a more horrible way to torture myself. A part of me wants me to reconsider what I\u2019m doing. I know it\u2019s stupid and reckless and petty, but I\u2019m all out of fucks to give. I head down the stairs as quickly as my legs can carry me. The sooner I get out of this house, the sooner I can move on from all the bullshit.\n\n   \u201cWhere are you going, Naser?\u201d my father\u2019s voice stops me in my tracks. I sigh and turn around. My dad is sitting there on the living room couch, a half-empty glass of something that smells like paint thinner in his hands.\n\n   I glare into my father\u2019s eyes but don\u2019t give him an answer. He should already know by the suitcase in my hand what the fuck I\u2019m doing.\n\n   My father downs the last of his drink and stands up from his seat, walking up to me and using his considerable bulk to try and intimidate me. \u201cAnd just what the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d He asks me like I\u2019m some kind of child.\n\n   \u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d I answer in the most resentful tone that I can muster.\n\n   Dad looks me up and down, almost like he\u2019s sizing me up like I\u2019m some kind of criminal. Who knows, by how he\u2019s been treating me for the last month, I might as well be a criminal in his eyes.\n\n   At that moment, my mother walks into the living room. She takes one look at the suitcase in my hand, and she rushes towards me, grabbing my arm like that\u2019s somehow going to prevent me from storming out the door.\n\n   \u201cW-why?\u201d She sobs out as tears flow from her seemingly permanently squinting eyes. \u201cWhy a-are you leaving us too?\u201d She tugs on my arm as if that\u2019s somehow going to change the mind I made up hours ago.\n\n   I can\u2019t take it anymore. I forcefully snatch my arm away from my mother and fix her with a furious glare. \u201cI\u2019m leaving because I\u2019m tired of being perfect!\u201d I shout, causing my mom to take a step away from me in fear. \u201cI\u2019m tired that no matter how hard I worked or how much I sacrificed, it never once felt like I was doing anything for myself, but instead to please everyone around me!\u201d I snap my eyes towards dad, who I can tell is getting real close to bringing out the golf clubs. Frankly, I don\u2019t give a fuck anymore. \u201cI\u2019m tired of always having to live with the knowledge that I had to excel to keep you from giving Lucy shit over an accident that happened years ago!\u201d I point an accusatory finger at my father, then turn back to look at my mother. \u201cAnd I\u2019m tired of having to be oh so perfect for a girlfriend who up and left me the instant I stopped being the absolute best!\u201d I balled my hand into a fist and grit my teeth so hard I could almost feel the enamel getting worn off. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being what everyone wants me to be\u2026 and I\u2019m not going to take it anymore!\u201d\n\n   Father rushes me with a speed I had never seen before in my life. Before I can fully process his movements, he grabs me by the collar of my shirt and slouches forward so that we\u2019re almost eye to eye.\n\n   \u201cYou\u2019re a real selfish brat right now, Naser,\u201d Dad tells me in a tone that\u2019s dripping with venom. \u201cI suggest you stop with the melodrama and get your head out of your ass before you hurt yourself.\u201d \n\n   I slap my father\u2019s hand away before shoving him away, albeit partially unsuccessfully due to his sheer bulk. Still, he gets the point as he looks at me with a shocked yet absolutely pissed expression.\n\n   \u201cI\u2019m not the one that needs to stop being selfish, dad,\u201d I say with as much vitriol as I can pack into my voice.\n\n   \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean,\u201d my father hisses through clenched teeth.\n\n   \u201cNot once did I ever see or hear you support Lucy\u2019s life choices. You only acted like she was some object that needed supervising. You never really understood her plight, the guilt she carried on her conscience. If you just tried to understand her for what she wanted to be and not what YOU wanted her to be, she wouldn\u2019t have felt the need to run away and possibly get killed!\u201d\n\n   \u201cAnd you think you\u2019re acting any better than your shithead of a sister!\u201d Father roared at me. \u201cYou\u2019re making the same fucking mistake!\u201d\n\n   And there it was. The real feelings dad had towards Lucy. Hearing him call her a \u2018shithead\u2019 almost felt cathartic. It verified all my emotions leading up to this moment. In a way, I almost wanted to thank him. He\u2019d made my decision all the easier for me to take.\n\n   I let out a bitter chuckle and turned away from my father. \u201cThen maybe Fang had the right idea,\u201d I say without so much as caring about what my words did to my father. Or my mother, for that matter. Though in the case of my mother, I did feel a little bit bad. I know she tried her best with us, but in the end, she didn\u2019t do anything to stop Lucy\u2014or rather, Fang\u2014from going down the path she wound up traveling. She shared as much guilt as my father did...\n\n   With those thoughts in my head, I make my way to the door, head held high and determined not to look back no matter what either my mother or father says to me. \n\n   As I grip my hand on the door handle, I hear my father roar, which gives me enough pause to hesitate.\n\n   \u201cNaser! If you walk out that door, then you better never come back to this house. You hear me!\u201d\n\n   I don\u2019t say another word as I turn the door handle and swing the door open. I don\u2019t stop as I shut the door behind me, and I walk down the walkway leading to my house. I do pause for a second to look back at the home I\u2019d probably never again return to. As I do, I hear the sound of shattering glass, followed by the wails of my mother as she no doubt falls on her knees weeping at the loss of her son.\n\n   I only turn right back around and finish making my way towards the Nas-Car. I stuff my suitcase in the trunk and make my way to the driver's seat. A slight sense of bliss fills me as I realize that I\u2019m doing something that won\u2019t help me achieve some kind of perfection for the first time in my life. Of course, that bliss is quickly overtaken by fear of the unknown future. Where would I go now? What will I do? \n\n   Whatever it is, it\u2019s going to be my choice. No one else\u2019s...\n\n \n\n   -Present Day-\n\nNaser let out a groan as he finished telling Anon and Stella something he had kept secret for close to four years. \n\n   Soon as his words are done, he again buries his face in his hands and sighs. \u201cI was so determined to escape from all the responsibilities and pressures of my life\u2026 except that I wound up doing exactly what I would have done anyway had I not had that outburst.\u201d The pterosaur began to laugh bitterly. \u201cI went to medical school like I was going to anyway and became a doctor as I would have anyway. My whole little rebellion accomplished nothing except getting me disowned and turning my family against me!\u201d He let out a single sniff and brought up his head, looking Anon directly in the eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so afraid of speaking to my parents again. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so afraid of meeting Lucy again\u2026\u201d\n\n   Anon, who had been quietly listening up to that point, looks to the floor in stunned silence. In his mind, Naser\u2019s hesitation sprung from his own perceived failures, that he was greatly exaggerating his guilt and working himself up over nothing. But after hearing the real reason for his old friend\u2019s hesitation to come home, he could completely understand the trepidation. \n\n   In some ways, his mistake was almost the same one he made with Fang four years earlier\u2026\n\n   \u2018This\u2026 complicates things,\u2019 Anon thought as he wondered what to do next.\n\n   \u201cComplicates things? Yes. Stops him from reaching his goal, no!\u201d Stella suddenly snapped as she grabbed Naser by the arm and forced him back to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re already here!\u201d she points to the house behind her, all the while looking deep into Naser\u2019s eyes. \u201cJust\u2026 take the plunge and make amends! I\u2019m sure your parents will understand and forgive you!\u201d\n\n   \u201cGod damned mumbling,\u201d Anon whispered as he looked at the scene playing before him. While he understands the exact train of thought that Stella had in mind, he still can\u2019t help but feel like it\u2019s not going to be satisfied in any way. Naser\u2019s mistake isn\u2019t something he can sweep under the rug with his parents. He cut ties with them, and they, in turn, probably cut ties with him. His actions and words led to his familial exile, something that is not so easily reversed. Something told him that Mr. Ripley was the kind of person to hold a very long, very spiteful memory of something like that\u2026\n\n   Naser glares at Stella and snatches his arm back. \u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say!\u201d he shouts, his cheeks turning a shade of red from anger, embarrassment, or both. \u201cYou weren\u2019t there to see their faces that night! How they looked at me like I was committing high treason!\u201d He shuts his eyes and turns away from the lime-yellow stego. \u201cThis\u2026 this was a stupid idea,\u201d he mutters, hanging his head in defeat. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026 wait in the Nas-Car,\u201d he whispers as the ptero staggers back to his car.\n\n   Stella turns back to face Anon, her eyes full of sadness and defeat. She looks to be on the verge of tears.\n\n   Anon feels an Anger bubble in him. In his mind, he wants to march up to Naser, slap some sense into him, and drag him back to his house\u2026 but he knows that he\u2019s projecting what he wants now. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that he, too, was precisely where Naser is now, a man afraid of his past, too broken and numb to even consider fixing his situation despite absolution lying literal feet away. A man so shackled by his fears that he was willing to turn away when all he had to do was reach out and grab that which tormented him so\u2026\n\n   \u2018No,\u2019 Anon whispered. He exhaled deeply and turned to face the Aaran residence. He still needed to apologize for what he did that night at the beach. Even if nothing got fixed that night, Fang\u2019s parents at least deserved to know that their daughter still lived. He was the reason she left them\u2026 making amends was the right thing to do, even if it was painful and potentially even dangerous\u2026\n\n   \u201cA-Anon?\u201d Stella called out the instant she noticed the new fire burning in her friend\u2019s eyes.\n\n   Anon, for his part, gave her a nod and smile before storming up to the Aaran household\u2019s door, at which point he rang the doorbell without a moment\u2019s hesitation.\n\n   Stella\u2019s eyes broadened in awe and horror. \u2018Oh my Jebus! That b-baka actually did it!?\u2019 she thinks, her mind reacting far faster than her body can to the audacity and craziness of Anon\u2019s act.\n\n   It takes less than ten seconds for the sound of heavy footsteps to approach the door. Anon wills his body to stand its ground despite every single one of his brain cells telling him to run away. He knows what he\u2019s exposing himself to. He knows what will happen the instant Mr. Ripley lays eyes on him, but he can\u2019t back out now. If his apology is the last thing he does in his life, it will at least be his best way to go out. \n\n   A just reward for a life full of bad decisions\u2026\n\n   \u201cHow many times do we have to tell you, bastards, we\u2019re not interested in anything you\u2019re sell\u2014\u201d Mr. Ripley roars out the moment he opens the door. The instant he locks eyes with Anon, his eyes fill with the kind of hate only a father who\u2019s forced to look upon the face of his child\u2019s killer can have. His whole body trembles as he clutches his hands shut so tightly that they pierce the palm and draw blood.\n\n   \u201cWhat is it, honey? Mrs. Samantha asks as she finds her way next to her husband, only also to be struck numb by the sight of Anon standing before her. Unlike her husband, though, the petite matriarch's expression is far more challenging to read. There is anger present, yes, but there is also sorrow, almost as if seeing Anon before her was akin to seeing the ghost of a past she had tried so desperately to move away from...\n\n   \u201cA-Anon?\u201d Samantha asks in a quiet, broken voice. Before another word leaves her lips, Anon finds a gigantic bloodstained hand wrapped around his neck, easily lifting him off the ground and holding him at least three feet above the ground. \n\n   Instinctively, Anon tries to grasp the gigantic dino hand constricting his breathing. As his hands fruitlessly try to lessen the terrible grip slowly squeezing the life out of him, he locks eyes with Mr. Ripley\u2019s amber orbs. They are awful, wrathful burning spheres that hold within them such overwhelming anger that Anon finds it amazing the elder ptero hasn\u2019t snapped his neck like he so very easily could.\n\n   \u201cHow fucking dare you show your face in house!\u201d Mr. Ripley roared as he lessened his grip just enough to allow Anon a breath of precious air before again constricting his neck. \u201cHOW DARE YOU COME BACK AFTER YOU TOOK MY DAUGHTER AWAY!\u201d\n\n   Mr. Ripley tightens his grip. Unlike Naser\u2019s chokehold, the human has no hope of reversing the elder ptero\u2019s terrible grip. Anon can only let out a strained gurgle as he feels his hand go numb. It suddenly dawns on him that he's on the verge of dying. That only makes his past regrets seem all the more terrible. With the last of his strength, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a piece of paper. In it, he wrote the exact address of where he had last seen Fang. He had scribbled it down, knowing full well that he might not live to see the following day.\n\n   So long as that information was known, he could at least die with some peace in his mind...\n\n   Samantha rushes forward and grabs her husband\u2019s arm. \u201cSTOP!\u201d she shouts as she desperately grips onto the matriarch\u2019s burly arm. \u201cYou\u2019re killing him!\u201d\n\n   \u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d Ripley answers coldly and distantly. He was done being nice. He was done being idle. For four years, he had let the pain fester in his heart. Now that he had the one responsible in his grasp, he would not waste his opportunity to achieve some form of absolution. Even if it meant damming his soul to hell...\n\n   Stella looks around her in a panic. She knows well she has no chance of stopping someone as big and robust as Mr. Ripley, but she's not going to stand by as she watches the life of someone precious to her get snuffed out. \u2018Even if I made no difference. Even if I get hurt in the process, I\u2019m not letting Anon die!\u2019 She thinks as she musters all of her strength and wills her legs to move.\n\n   But before she can spring forth to action, a blur of brown and orange rush past her. Before her mind can finish processing what her eyes had seen, she hears the voice of Naser, letting out a roar of fury. The stego turns her attention to the scene in time to see the young doctor attempt to tackle his father. \n\n   While Naser\u2019s form isn\u2019t nearly large enough to leave a dent on Ripley, the force of his sprint, combined with the element of surprise with which it occurred, causes the patriarch to lose his wind temporarily. More importantly, the blow is enough to force him to loosen his grip on Anon\u2019s neck, all the while pushing him further into the house's foyer.  \n\n   Anon Falls on the ground choking and gagging in a desperate attempt to bring oxygen back into his lungs. The previous strength Stella had been putting into rushing and tackling the elder ptero she puts towards hurrying to Anon's side. Wasting not a second, she picks up the human and helps him sit against a nearby wall, all the while checking his neck for any wound that would prevent him from adequately absorbing oxygen.\n\n   Meanwhile, Ripley lets out a roar of rage as he readies his fist to smash down on whoever dared interrupt his attempt at obtaining justice. Before he can make contact, the assailant jumps back and fixes him with a glare full of mixed emotions ranging from rage, regret, fear, and finally to\u2026 happiness? \n\n   Ripley manages enough breaths in his lung to cool some of his rage. In that moment of sudden clarity, he recognizes the face of the ptero now glaring back at him and standing guard over the body of the human he\u2019d been so joyously strangling seconds ago.\n\n   Ripley\u2019s expression flashes with mixed emotions at the sight of the son he thought he\u2019d never see again. Anger at his daring to show his face in his house again. Joy at seeing him again despite their previous fallout. Relief at seeing him not only alive but also healthy and strong. Finally, back to anger, not just as the fact that he had come back after what he did four years earlier, but that he was protecting the one who had caused all their pain and misery in the first place. He couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around that last part, and it filled him with such bitterness that it was starting to make him see red.\n\n   Ripley opens his mouth to shout at his son. He\u2019s cut off when Samantha rushes forward and wraps Naser in a tight embrace, her arms and wings forming a protective cocoon over her child as she allows herself to weep. \u201cMy son!\u201d she says through the sobs. \u201cM-my N-Naser\u2019s back home!\u201d Her grip over her son grows tighter as her tears begin to stain Naser\u2019s trademark arboreal jacket. \u201cI-is it really y-you!?\u201d\n\n   Naser, for his part, returns his mother\u2019s embrace. \u201cYes,\u201d he whispers, trying his best not to break into sobs of his own. \u201cIt\u2019s really me. I-I\u2019m back\u2026\u201d \n\n   Naser broke off from his mother\u2019s embrace and turned to meet his father as much as he hated to. He again fixes the elder ptero with a glare as he takes a step forward so that the two are standing within arm\u2019s reach of each other.\n\n   Ripley narrows his eyes and puffs out his chest in a display of intimidation. It doesn\u2019t work quite as he intended, as Naser only intensifies the glare in his eyes. As elder and junior ptero continue their stand-off, the very air grows heavy as the dinos seemingly prepare to enter into a no-holds-barred brawl.\n\n   \u201cSTOP IT!\u201d Samantha shouts at the top of her lungs, jumping between her son and husband, all the while putting her hands up and spreading her wings as wide as they can go. \u201cStop this nonsense, NOW!\u201d\n\n   Samantha, the usually laid back and relaxed housewife of the Aaran household, snaps her regularly closed eyes wide open and sets her visage into a deep and terrible scowl, one she brings down upon both her husband and child. Almost as soon as that terrible gaze falls upon them, the two pteros lose whatever swagger they were building and shrink back in fear.\n\n   \u201cNow, you two listen to me!\u201d Samantha starts, her voice cold and barely holding back the rage bubbling in her chest. \u201cI have been waiting for the day that our family returns to some semblance of togetherness for four years. FOUR YEARS!\u201d she snaps, all the while shifting her gaze back and forth between her warring son and husband. \u201cNow that our boy has returned home, we will try to be a HAPPY family!\u201d The petite ptero matriarch snaps her glare directly at Ripley. She takes a step forward, all the while jabbing a finger into the ptero patriarch\u2019s chest. \u201cAnd I will NOT have you ruin this with your stupid machismo!\u201d She then snaps her glare back to Naser, who can't help but take a step back out of fear. \u201cOr you with your rebelliousness!\u201d she hisses through clenched teeth. \u201cThe two of you are going to make up this instant, or so help me I\u2019m going to smack the two of you around until you do!\u201d\n\n   Ripley\u2019s brow fills with dozens of beads of sweat. He uncomfortably shifts his gaze around the foyer, looking at everything and anything that wasn\u2019t his son or wife. \n\n   Finally, after the piercing and hot glare of his wife breaks through the last of his rage-created defenses, Ripley clears his throat and takes a step towards Naser. With a heavy sigh, he softens his gaze and raises his hands. \u201cNaser\u2026 m-my boy\u2026 I\u2026 m-missed you,\u201d he says in a voice that almost comes off as bashful.\n\n   Despite his previous rage, Naser is surprised to hear his father sound so vulnerable. Vulnerability was already a concept he was convinced his father had never learned or actively ripped out of his brain, so to see it happen before his eyes left him with a feeling that he can barely describe. Gradually though, the feeling supplants whatever negativity he might have harbored towards his dad, to the point that the reason he had once feuded with him became less and less critical. With a final sigh to dispel any negative emotion from himself, Naser looks at his father\u2019s eyes, the corners of his lips rising ever so slightly in the process. \u201cI\u2026 I missed you too, dad\u2026\u201d  \n\n   Samantha claps her hands together and once more shuts her eyes as a smile returns to her lips. \u201cSee, was that so hard?\u201d she asks in a sweet yet vaguely threatening voice. She quickly rushes to the front door and shuts it, ensuring that whatever other shouting happened, it would stay inside the Aaran residence.\n\n   Both Naser and Ripley let out a nervous chuckle before sighing in relief.\n\n   Crisis averted for the time being.\n\n   Naser looks back to Anon. Despite the human\u2019s best efforts, he was still struggling to breathe, even with Stella helping him sit upright.\n\n   Wasting not one second, Naser rushes towards his friend and inspects his neck. He lets out a hiss as he realizes that while there was no external damage, the force of his father\u2019s grip very nearly crushed the windpipe. There would be definite bruising and soreness, maybe even another visit to the hospital if it were bad enough...\n\n   Naser looks at Stella. \u201cHelp me get him up,\u201d he tells the still shocked stego. She follows the order without question. \u201cHold him up and steady,\u201d he tells her as he lets go of Anon\u2019s arm and turns back to face his father, all the while his brow furrows and his eyes sharpen. \n\n   \u201cThat was way out of line, dad!\u201d\n\n   Ripley shoots Anon a glare before setting his sight back on Naser. \u201cWhy are you defending that piece of scum? You know well what he did to this family.\u201d\n\n   Naser hesitates for a second. The dying amber of his hate threatens to set his soul alight once again, but he snuffs them out by telling himself that he was past that point in his life. \u2018Besides\u2026\u2019 he thinks before taking a deep breath of air and steeling himself for his words to come. \u2018He\u2019s doing something I was too cowardly to do for so many years\u2026\u2019\n\n   \u201cDad\u2026 I know what Anon did. Believe me; I have lived with that knowledge for the last four years too.\u201d\n\n   Ripley crosses his arms. \u201cIf you know, then why ar\u2014\u201d\n\n   \u201cDESPITE that,\u201d Naser snaps, cutting his father\u2019s words off and causing the elder ptero\u2019s eyes to go broad with surprise. \u201cAnon\u2019s the reason I\u2019m here tonight. If it wasn\u2019t for his\u2026 lack of self-preservation\u2026 I would have kept on living without once thinking about making amends with you and mom...\u201d  \n\n   Naser\u2019s words shake Ripley to his core. He shoots another glare towards Anon, who, for his part in all of this, continues to stand there supported by a woman he was sure he\u2019d never seen before, holding on to his neck and still attempting to breathe. How could that human be both responsible for his daughter\u2019s vanishing and the return of his son?\n\n   \u201cDad,\u201d Naser says as he takes another step forward. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 that I also ran from this family four years ago. It was the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d He shut his eyes and sighs wearily. \u201cI was so convinced that running from all of this would lead me to a better life... when the reality was that it led me to repeat so many of the same mistakes. Worse yet, it turned me into something I wasn\u2019t!\u201d The young doctor takes another step forward and once again stops only an arm\u2019s length away from his father. \u201cI stopped socializing for fear of losing my friends and loved ones like I did with Lucy and Naomi. I tossed myself into my schoolwork and did nothing else in a desperate attempt to prove that I was still perfect when that perfection was what was killing me. I pushed my body and mind to the brink daily so that I could focus on getting that damn degree when that only caused me physical and emotional anguish... and for what? Only to return home an almost broken man desperate to one day find his sister and make the one responsible for her vanishing pay\u2026\u201d Naser puts his head on his father\u2019s chest and lets out a mournful sob. \u201cC-can you find it in your heart to forgive a stupid, idiot boy for all of his mistakes?!\u201d The ptero cries out, unable to keep his composure any longer. \n\n   To say that Ripley is stunned by his son\u2019s words is an understatement. Within the ptero patriarch, a fierce battle rages between his mind and his heart. His mind told him that he couldn\u2019t let go, that he couldn\u2019t forgive. One didn\u2019t just forget four years with a finger snap. His son had made a grave mistake, and he deserved to be punished as gravely for it. If he didn\u2019t, could he call himself a lawman at all?\n\n   Ripley\u2019s heart, however, sang a very different tune. It told him that punishment wouldn\u2019t magically turn back the hands of the clock. His child had returned to him and was within arm\u2019s reach, begging for forgiveness for a crime that wasn\u2019t even all his in the first place\u2026\n\n   It was that final recognition that stung the hardest for Ripley. In all his stubbornness, he first gave up on Lucy and put all of the world\u2019s weight on Naser\u2019s shoulders. When Lucy ran away, he blamed Naser for failing to be a good brother, neglecting to realize that it had been Naser and only Naser who had ever truly cared for Lucy. If there was anyone who had failed Lucy in her most significant time of need, it was neither Naser nor Anon as he had believed for so long. \n\n   The chain of failure had started with him\u2026\n\n   Tears welled in Ripley\u2019s eyes as he embraced his son for the first time in four years. \u201cSon,\u201d he starts, his voice barely holding together as it threatens to burst into sobbing. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry too. I should've never put so much pressure on your shoulders. I Shouldn\u2019t have ever given up on Lucy as I did. I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Ripley increases the tightness of his embrace on his son, who in return also embraces his father all the harder. \n\n   The hug between father and son lasts almost a full minute. By the time Naser breaks it, his eyes are puffy and red, though the smile on his lips speaks another story, one of joy and peace after so many years of regrets and sorrows. He turns to face his mother, an apology already formed in the tip of his tongue, when she merely rushes forward and hugs him again like there was no tomorrow.\n\n   \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026 my sweet little Naser. I f-forgive you!\u201d Samantha managed to say between sobs of joy. \n\n   Ripley moves forward and also hugs his son and wife, wrapping the two in a protective cocoon with both his arms and wings.\n\n   While by no means a complete family yet, in that fleeting moment, the Aaran\u2019s felt like in the old days, before the pressures of life and disappointments about the future battered and tore at their dreams.\n\n   For one moment, Naser, Ripley, and Samantha dared to believe they had found a small piece of peace once again\u2026 \n\n   Despite his best efforts to keep his presence as diminished as possible, Anon lets out a string of painful coughs, which nearly causes him to double over as the pain racks at his throat. The only thing that keeps him standing is Stella\u2019s diligent grip. \n\n   Ripley lets go of his family and walks up to both Anon and Stella. His previous expression of bliss vanishes the instant he locks eyes with the human. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t understand you... You\u2019re the reason that Lucy ran away... yet you\u2019re also the reason my son came back\u2026\u201d Ripley grimaces as he again moves to grab the dainty caveman. \n\n   Before Ripley\u2019s hand can get anywhere near Anon, Stella slaps it away, which causes the ptero to stop in his tracks and flinch in surprise. The stego then begins dragging the human away from Ripley and towards the house\u2019s main entrance.\n\n   Ripley turns to face his wife with a flabbergasted expression on his face. The diminutive ptero shakes her head in reply before pointing to her husband and making a strangling motion with her hands.\n\n   It takes about two seconds before Ripley\u2019s eyes widen as the realization hits him like one of his golf clubs to the head.\n\n   Meanwhile, Stella is making some headway dragging Anon, who for his part is doing his best to struggle against the stego\u2019s grasp. \u201cLet\u2026 go\u2026 of me,\u201d he hisses at his dino companion.\n\n   \u201cIt\u2019s okay Anon, I\u2019ll get you out of here!\u201d Stella boldly declares as she tries her best to lift the human over her shoulder. Of course, the moment she manages to get his feet off the ground, Anon\u2019s weight, combined with her awkward footing, causes the stego to collapse backward. She hits the ground pretty hard, leaving her partially addled. \n\n   Anon, meanwhile, is flung backward at least five feet. He winds up striking his head against a nearby wall, causing him to see more than a few stars.\n\n   Seconds later, Anon feels a strong hand lift him off the floor and stand him straight. It takes the human a few seconds for his vision to fully return, by which time he realizes far too late that the one who picked him off the floor had been none other than Ripley.\n\n   Swallowing very painfully, Anon looks up to meet Ripley\u2019s eyes. Instantly, he feels the very warmth leave his body. At the same time, he also feels a strange sense of ease. \u2018Sooner or later, I was gonna get killed,\u2019 he thinks as he mentally prepares for Naser\u2019s father to grab his neck once again, this time finishing what he had started minutes earlier.\n\n   But before Ripley could have his shot at strangling him, he needed to get the guilt off his chest.\n\n   \u201cI\u2026 I understand if you never forgive me\u2026\u201d Anon whispered in a strained, raspy voice. \u201cI know... I have... no right... to apologize for... what I did to your daughter... but\u2026\u201d Wasting not one single second, the young man bows his head before Ripley. \u201cI\u2019m truly\u2026. truly sorry... for my actions... that night...!\u201d \n\n   Ripley lets out a sneer as he drags Anon forward. He even slouches forward enough so that he\u2019s face to face with the human. \n\n   \u201cI\u2019ll never forgive you for helping to kill my daughter,\u201d Ripley hisses, his words colder than the coldest glacier on earth. \n\n   Anon takes the patriarch\u2019s words and shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong\u2026 about... Fa\u2014L-Lucy,\u201d Anon manages to say despite his ravaged voice doing everything it can to fail him.\n\n   Ripley\u2019s eyes snap wide, and he grits his teeth in absolute fury. \u201cWhat did you say, punk!?\u201d he growls, his face coming dangerously close to Anon\u2019s.\n\n   \u201cFang\u2019s... alive\u2026!\u201d Anon barely manages to rasp, his voice giving into a cacophony of coughs seconds after he managed to speak those crucial words to Ripley.\n\n   Upon hearing Anon\u2019s words, the ptero patriarch locks eyes with Anon and grabs him by the shoulder, albeit a bit more gently this time. \u201cW-what did you say?\u201d He asks the human in a flabbergasted tone. \n\n   \u201cFang\u2019s\u2026 alive\u2026\u201d Anon repeats, all the while trying to stop his heart from beating faster than an anime fan who somehow managed to score himself a date for prom night with the head cheerleader. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know... what she\u2019s been doing... for the last four years... but I saw her playing a shitty gig... a little over a week ago at a pizzeria in... Skin Row\u2026\u201d\n\n   \u201cO-one week ago!\u201d Ripley shouts in a mixture of pain and rage.\n\n   Anon flinches at the ptero\u2019s raised voice. He glances to the side and notices how Samantha and Naser are helping Stella back to her feet. She looks a little worse for wear but overall seemed to be unharmed. Anon let out a sigh of relief, though he wasn\u2019t sure why since Stella had caused him to fall earlier with her \u2018rescue\u2019 attempt. Still, he couldn\u2019t fault her for trying.\n\n   With that particular burden off his shoulders, and his newfound determination pushing him to say what needed to be said, Anon once more narrated his life up until he met with Naser. He told it all, from his return to Volcadera after four years in the navy, to his running across Fang by complete chance, to his regret for not speaking to her when he had a chance, to the subsequent week and its mocking dreams of a better life, to his drinking and smoking and self-harm and eventual hospitalization. \n\n   On hearing his friend end his tale, Naser leaves Stella\u2019s side and stands beside the human, also looking his father in the eye. With a deep sigh to steel his nerves, he picks up right where Anon left off. He, too, tells it all and tells it truly, including the moment when he tried to strangle Anon before his realization hit like a train full of bricks. \n\n   Anon takes a step forward and approaches Ripley with a determined look in his eyes. He\u2019s aware of the danger he\u2019s putting himself in by just being that close to the still furious elder ptero. Still, a part of him isn\u2019t afraid anymore. Much like with Naser before, he couldn't afford to run, not if he could fix all of the mistakes in his life.\n\n   \u201cMr. Ripley,\u201d Anon starts, his voice still raspy and weak but also filled with newfound courage. \u201cI may\u2026 have made many mistakes\u2026 in my life\u2026 but I\u2019m done\u2026 running and hiding\u2026 from them...\u201d He fixes the ptero with a grin. Weak at first, but growing with confidence with every passing second. \u201cI will\u2026 set things... right with Fang\u2026 and I will\u2026 bring her back home\u2026 even if it\u2019s\u2026 the last thing I do\u2026 because\u2026 this is my second\u2026 chance\u2026 and I am not\u2026 wasting it\u2026!\u201d\n\n   Ripley\u2019s face is a mixture of strong emotions. Anger, confusion, regret, despair, happiness, and perhaps strongest of all, hope. He can only look at the human with confoundment, his previous words about how he couldn\u2019t understand the human buzzing in his mind. A part of him wanted the simplicity that came with hating the human. Yet, from hearing his tale and feeling the regret in his voice and seeing the shame in his eyes, the elder ptero found any reason to despise Anon fading by the second. After all, how could he hate someone who had already suffered so much and had come out stronger for it? How could he hate someone so determined to right all his wrongs?\n\n   Ripley bitterly chuckles to himself. Much as the idea seemed alien to him in this world, perhaps in some other place and time, Anon would have made a good husband to Lucy...\n\n   Samantha walks up to Anon without saying a word. Anon, for his part, is startled by the sudden appearance of the petite ptero, but he tells himself that whatever she had to say to him, he more than deserved. He locks his eyes with the matriarch\u2019s closed eyes. Even so, he can still feel her gaze pierce right through him, exposing his every weakness to her perception as if she had x-ray vision.\n\n   The matriarch of the Aaron household breathes deep, and without a single moment of hesitation, slaps Anon across the face, causing the human to stagger sideways a bit, as the impact of the slap is both so sudden and so powerful. \u2018God, it feels like I just got punched by a martial arts champ!\u2019 Anon manages to cobble together in his brain as he instinctively rubs his cheek, which feels like it\u2019s swelling with every passing second.\n\n   \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 for breaking the heart of my little pirate princess\u2026\u201d Samantha says coldly. Anon readjusts his posture and nods, accepting the blow as well-earned. He readied himself for another when he sees Samantha\u2019s arms twitch. He closes his eyes and prepares himself for the pain that's to come.\n\n   But what came next wasn\u2019t something the human expected.\n\n   Samantha lets out a sob and lunges forward, wrapping her arms around Anon, locking him in a tight embrace that made his muscles ache from the surprising amount of force the petite housewife could generate.\n\n   Anon does not return the embrace. He does not feel like he deserves to...\n\n   \u201cThank you for bringing my son back to me,\u201d Samantha sobs into Anon's shoulder, which suddenly becomes sodden with tears as the ptero lets herself weep freely. Less than ten seconds later, Fang\u2019s mother breaks the embrace and makes her way next to her husband, who finally appears to be composed enough to speak again.\n\n   \u201cAnon I\u2026\u201d Ripley begins, his voice coarse and uneven, almost as if he was struggling to maintain his usual gravely demeanor. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Ripley shuts his eyes and lets out a loud groan before he again fixes Anon with a glare. Only, this glare isn\u2019t one of hatred or anger or resentment. Instead, it's filled with something Anon never thought he\u2019d see from Fang\u2019s father\u2026\n\n   \u201cDammit, kid, you\u2019ve given me the one thing I never thought I\u2019d have ever again\u2026\u201d He snarls and points a finger at the human. \u201cI swear in the name of Raptor Jesus, if you are fucking lying to us about our daughter, I\u2019m going to mount your head on my wall, damn be whatever jail time I have to face!\u201d\n\n   Anon again painfully swallows as he nods.\n\n   The elder ptero walks up to the human and grabs him by the shoulders. At first, Anon believes he\u2019s about to get strangled again, but that fear\u2019s put to rest when Ripley, much to the human\u2019s shock, brings him in for a hug of his own. \n\n   As if the embrace wasn\u2019t already surprising enough, he hears the ptero patriarch break down into silent, dignified sobs, all the while his grip on the human grows tighter and tighter.\n\n   \u201cThank you for giving this old man hope again,\u201d Ripley whispered through barely contained sobs. \u201cThank you\u2026\u201d\n\n   Anon brings up an uneasy hand and pats Ripley in the back. As he does, his determination grows ever more potent than before, supplanting whatever doubts he might have had in the past about his next course of action.\n\n   It was time to set things right with Fang..."},"A Casual Meeting.txt":{"path":["Multiple","A Casual Meeting.txt"],"text":"Title: A Casual Meeting\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Spears and Ripley\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n3:10 AM, at a sleepy 24\/7 rest stop off of a major interstate. The air inside is frigid cold despite the lukewarm early dawn summer air outside, a welcome respite for the weary family of tourists that sat at one of the windowside tables as their children stared out into the night and chewed on their wholly inappropriate breakfast of dry cheesy pork sausage rolls that had been turning in the warmer since last evening. The television blasted out a rerun of a story on VNN as the smell of cheap coffee battled it out with the harsh, sterile scent of the blue chemical that thankfully mostly covered up the stench of the neglected bathrooms.\n\nPrincipal Spears yawned and stretched his neck, sighing in relief as he felt the aching of driving at such early hours ease up after a few quiet pops. He stared at the half-dead coffee machine that was slowly dripping its burnt caffeine goodness into the first of two cheap styrofoam cups. At least it provided him an excuse to relax a little before he would rejoin his sleeping wife in the car.\n\nA set of heavy, shambling footsteps pulled his attention away from his morning coffee.\n\n\u201cAh! Sheriff Ripley, good morning. I\u2019m surprised to see you all the way out here.\u201d\n\u201cMornin\u2019 Principal... Spears...\u201d\n\u201cHaving an early start? Or maybe a late night?\u201d\n\u201cLate night. The boys in the next precinct over were planning a massive midnight drug bust on a den right on the border and they requested our help. Sent over six squad cars and a chopper. Shoulda\u2019 sent the whole damn force in hindsight.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like quite the operation.\u201d\n\u201cIt was, Raptor Jesus, it was. Spent the entire night rounding up a bunch of dealers hopped up on their own goods through the woods. Ever seen a dino hopped up on Blue Sparkle or BigPig or whatever they\u2019re callin\u2019 it nowadays?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t say I have?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy stuff. I swear one of them turned into a skinnie from how he was swinging from the trees\u2026 Oh uh, sorry \u2018bout that Principal...\u201d\n\u201cNo worries. I\u2019m glad I never had to deal with that at Volcano High. The worst case I\u2019ve witnessed was a student accidentally bringing his marijuanna. Although I do suspect one of my students was on something a little stronger. Carfentanyl, perhaps. I never did catch them but from how the smell seems to have disappeared I suspect the student in question has graduated.\u201d\n\u201cHeh. Carf. I wish I was dealing with Carfers. If that\u2019s the worst at your place then you\u2019ve ran that school well.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Sheriff. Ah. It looks like it\u2019s full. I\u2019ve got another cup to fill for my wife, would you like to go first?\u201d\n\u201cNah\u2026 Nah, thanks but you go ahead, I might just stare at the doughnuts til you\u2019re done\u2026 I ain\u2019t got anywhere to go but home anyhow... From the getup I\u2019m guessin\u2019 you\u2019re on a little summer break road trip?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. My wife and I are visiting her family in Wyoming.\u201d\n\u201cWyoming, huh. Gonna catch an early flight?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately no. My wife is terrified of planes.\u201d\n\u201cOh hell, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re driving all the way over there!?\u201d\n\u201cWe are. We flew the last time we visited but she couldn\u2019t handle it. In any case it won\u2019t be just a drive. We do plan on visiting a few places in between. Mostly the usual tourist attractions but my wife swears that there is a restaurant that we absolutely have to stop at on the way.\u201d\n\u201cSounds fun. How\u2019s your wife, by the way?\u201d\n\u201cVery well, thank you for asking. She made sure we had her favorite Korean war drama for the trip. The Burning Flower of Incheon and the Enraged Dragon of Water, all fifty-two episodes.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, you into that sorta stuff?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately no. It\u2019s interesting enough to be entertaining, however my tastes lie slightly more to the east.\u201d\n\u201cYou bring any of your own stuff?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I can\u2019t be distracted while driving and my wife can\u2019t stand most of what I like anyways.\u201d\n\u201cMan\u2019s gotta make sacrifices for the wife, eh?\u201d\n\u201cAs all husbands must. There we are, I\u2019m sorry it took so long.\u201d\n\u201cEgh\u2026 Don\u2019t worry about it. This whole place is falling apart.\u201d\n\u201c...\u201d\n\u201c...damn, no hazelnut creamer.\u201d\n\u201cHazelnut? I mean no offence but I always assumed police officers liked their coffee straight black.\u201d\n\u201cMost don\u2019t but they still get it like that. Rookies, the lot of \u2018em. Think they gotta act macho in front of the boss. Nuts to that, I want my doughnut to be the healthy option.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I assume the doughnut will be similarly sugared?\u201d\n\u201cHaha! You got that right! Plain? Dunked in coffee? No thanks. Powdered sugar, sprinkles, filled with as much lemon creme without it burstin\u2019. I see enough rough garbage out there, no need to eat it too. Just don\u2019t tell my wife. She always gets on my case about how I need to watch my sugar intake.\u201d\n\u201cOverconsumption of sugar is unhealthy, that much is true.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know. But it\u2019s the sugar or I take my wife with me to work and I can\u2019t take my wife with me to work.\u201d\n\u201cHow sweet.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell her that either, she\u2019s never gonna forget it.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you should. It would sweeten the marriage a little bit.\u201d\n\u201cHa! Ya know, maybe I will. Our anniversary\u2019s coming up next week. \u2018My Dearest Samantha, Your Sugar To My Coffee.\u2019 Hah, that\u2019s a good one! I\u2019m getting that one on a ring!\u201d\n\u201cOn a ring?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s into that sort of corny, sappy romantic garbage. Hell, it might actually work.\u201d\n\u201cWell in any case, Congratulations on your marriage, Sheriff.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, buddy. You gettin\u2019 a doughnut too?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I will. We do have sandwiches in the car but I do want a hot breakfast...\u201d\n\u201cHot, eh? You gotta get the hashbrowns then. It\u2019s the one thing this place does great. I dunno if it\u2019s the oil they use or what but that kid back there knows what the hell he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\u201cWell now I\u2019m going to have to, if it\u2019s good enough for you to recommend it.\"\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re gonna want to get at least two per person.\u201d\n\u201cTwo?\u201d\n\u201cYep, one to eat hot and the second to eat after it\u2019s cooled off first. It\u2019s crazy but I swear it tastes even better cold.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sometimes I get a half-dozen if I know I\u2019m going to be out for a while. Ooh, \u2018nother thing to keep from my wife. Too much salt, she says.\u201d\n\u201cHusband\u2019s honor.\u201d\n\u201cFrom how you\u2019ve run that school I feel I can take that to the bank.\u201d\n\u201cThank you very much again, Sheriff.

I don\u2019t wanna keep your lady waiting.\u201d\n\u201cNo worries, Sheriff. She\u2019s still fast asleep.\u201d\n\u201cRight, right. So when will I see ya next?

Another blisteringly hot and aridly dry day in Volcaldera Bluffs, at least with that heat also comes a bright and sunny day with no clouds in the sky. I\u2019m driving down the highway, on my way to see my brother-in-law who I haven\u2019t spoken to in quite some time at this point.  Not for anything negative, just lost touch due to a lack of-.\n\n\u201cDaaaad! How much longer until we get there?\u201d \na young voice pipes up from the backseat, reaching a red light I turn to face her, the second joy of my life, my daughter Lucy. Smiling that beautiful bright smile as she kicks her legs back and forth in her car seat.  She was a spitting image of her mother, beautiful in every way, every day I get to spend with them I could count as a blessing from Raptor Jesus. Unfortunately, Fang couldn\u2019t come along as well, with school right on the horizon they had the teachers of Volcano High working double time to go over curriculums and events\nI smile at her and give her a prompt reply, \u201cJust a few more minutes, I promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said Uncle Naser is going to be there, right? What about Aunty Olivia, and Ozzy?\u201d\n\nThe light switches to green, I return my focus to the road but reply to her all the same, \u201cOzzy will be there, but Aunt Olivia had to go with her father on a trip and won\u2019t be able to be there.\u201d\n\nShe gives me a slight pout upon hearing that Olivia won\u2019t be there, but shoots a reply I was all but expecting, \u201cOzzy and I can play pirates and princesses together, right dad?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course sweetie, just so long as you two don\u2019t run out too far, make sure either I or Uncle Naser can see you two alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t run off this time dad, I promise!\u201d\n\n\u201cAtta girl.\u201d I smile facing forward as I pull up to the parking lot for the park, I knew that reply could only be half trusted deep down, she\u2019s as much of a wild child and rebellious spirit as her mother was in her teenage years.  Keeping an eye on her is a full-time job top of the job I already had, but it\u2019s a job I\u2019m more than happy to do. I put the car in park and climb out, giving myself a short stretch before going to help Lucy out as well, undoing the belt and getting her out of the booster seat I carefully lift her up, eliciting a short laugh from the young ptero as I gently set her down on the sidewalk before shutting the car and locking it. I take her hand in mine, leading her along into the park towards the kids play area, it had been equally long since I had been here as well, with how sporadic my work schedule was year-round it tended to be Fang who would take her on these playdates as I\u2019d often be stuck working on the weekends they planned for.\nI lead my daughter along into the park, before long arriving at the spot where I was supposed to meet with my brother and his son. It's a nice little cutout in the sprawling park: a nice view over the waterfront with assorted covered picnic tables for families to stop and eat at, benches, and a sizable playground for kids of most ages: jungle gym, swings, slides, you name it. Before I had too much time to really take it all in the voice of a small boy, accompanied by the poking of blunt plastic to my thigh, quickly drew my attention away from the view,\n\n\u201cYarrr! Hand over the princess landlubber!\u201d\nI look down in the direction of that prodding to spot my nephew, Ozzy, lightly jabbing at my leg with a plastic cutlass. He bore so much resemblance to his mother, though the crest poking out of the top of that shaggy hair of his was a dead giveaway to who his father was. Before I had much time to greet the little tyke, Lucy had blurted out a statement of defiance, \u201cYou\u2019ll never take me alive pirate!\u201d\n\nThe pair started to essentially dance around my legs, Lucy using them for cover while she ducked back and forth as Ozzy kept poking around and chasing her, the mixture of giggling laughing and \u2018yarrs\u2019 was soul-warming, it was impossible to not break a full-on smile and begin chuckling a bit myself while watching the pair go at it. Eventually the pirate did end up catching the princess, causing her to let a playful yet ear-piercing shriek, I watch on as Ozzy takes my daughter \u201ccaptive\u201d and leads her over to the jungle gym he so kindly refers to as the brig as a familiar voice jokingly remarks to me from nearby,\n\n\u201cLooks like the pirate caught the princess yet again, \u2018ey Anon?\u201d\nThere he was, former track star, current surgeon, and my brother-in-law, Naser. His fashion sense still clearly as terrible as ever, always seeming to have a thing for floral print tops of all kinds, grey slacks, at least his shoes these days seemed somewhat sensible instead of those overpriced Kanyesaurus abominations he had back in high school. He walks over to me with a smile on his face, large black aviators concealing his eyes, I extend my arm out to him offering a handshake, reciprocating his smile to him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been way too long, Naser.  How\u2019s life been treating you the last half a year?\u201d\n\nNaser firmly grasps my hand and shakes it, quickly responding to my question, \u201cI can\u2019t complain really, it\u2019s been smooth sailing for the most part, especially with Olivia being able to take as much time as she is to watch after Ozzy, definite relief on my shoulders in the event I get called in to perform surgery of some form.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t keep you too terribly busy, does it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it can, it really depends on what the situation is, if I\u2019m needed for more than one case, stuff like that can really add to the time I\u2019m on the clock. Guessing your job is still as off the wall as ever, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could say that, I got a job with a studio thankfully but it\u2019s all just working whenever I\u2019m needed, pays well though so I don\u2019t have to worry about any lulls in workdays.\u201d\n\nNaser gives me a nod and a short pat on the shoulder before walking over to sit on a nearby bench that looked on towards the playground our kids were messing around on without a care in the world. I follow suit, sitting down next to him and relaxing back against the warm metal of the bench.\n\u201cSo, everything okay with Olivia? Just wondering why she couldn\u2019t tag along with all of us today.\u201d\nHe gives me a slight chuckle before responding lightheartedly, \u201cYeah, she and Mark are out on some trip, going to catch some metal concert a few towns over. Basically left me alone looking after Ozzy for the weekend; what about Fang, she busy at the school today or something?\n\n\u201cYeah, classes are just a few weeks away so they\u2019ve got all the teachers in to go over curriculums and what not.  She did tell me to say hi to you for her, as well as to grab some pictures of the kids playing to send while she\u2019s stuck dealing with tedium all day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell tell her I said hi and sorry that she couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d A chuckle escapes from him after completing his response, potentially caught on the same thought as I am of Fang groaning while Principal whoever-it-is-now goes over all the stuff each class has to cover in either an overly cheery or completely bureaucratic manner.\n\n\u201cYou know, Anon, it\u2019s been over a decade now since you and I went to this park, nearly this same spot in it no less, bring back any memories?\u201d he asks me calmly, turning to face me as the discussion draws back to our high school days.\n\n\u201cYeah, I remember Fang being moments away from murdering Naomi multiple times. You still got that leopard print mankini she mentioned?\u201d\n\nI watched with a bit of a cocky smirk as the color quickly drained from his face, before one of his hands slid up to hold his forehead,\n\u201cNo I do n- of ALL the details you could be bothered to remember that\u2019s one of the ones that stuck?!\u201d He turns his head away from me, groaning as he looks up to the blue skies above, likely questioning Raptor Jesus to when he\u2019d be forgiven for past transgressions.\n\nI reach an arm around behind him and pull the sulking pterodactyl in closer, \u201cI remember it being a fun double date overall, and that we ended up getting VVorm Drama their first real venue that night, the look of pure elation on Fang\u2019s face when I told her is something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\n\nNaser was slowly coming back to Earth after his being attempted to be anywhere other than next to me, letting out a short and deep sigh as he looked out at the playground again once more, at this point it was the princess attempting to catch the pirate, as Lucy had somehow procured the sword and was chasing him down across a rope bridge, high pitched battle cries included.\n\n\u201cI remember driving Fang home that night, she couldn\u2019t stop shaking for a moment, talking my ear off the whole way about how great it had gone and how everyone in the crowd loved it. Going on and on about what she wanted to do next, wondering where they\u2019d play next, I swear she probably didn\u2019t get a single hour of sleep that night she was so fired up.\u201d\n\nI chuckle a bit at the thought of it, she probably kept everyone in that house up all night for all I know, she rode the high of that concert for weeks after. \u201cRemember prom? You wore some suit that made you look like you were auditioning for a Miami Vice reboot.\u201d\n\nNaser starts to chuckle before giving me a measured reply, \u201cOh my suit was tacky? What about that tuxedo you wore with all the wine stains on the sleeves from your \u2018important announcements\u2019?\u201c before he burst out laughing, I couldn\u2019t help but join in with him, even if was at my expense.\n\n\u201cThe same announcement I almost drunkenly made at my wedding before Fang nearly choked me out with my own tie?\u201d I continued, still trying to reign in my chuckling and sides before continuing the conversation, \u201cI still remember the gifts as well: your dad got me golf clubs, Rosa got Fang and I some expensive flowers, Stella gave me some anime I still never watched, Reed and his pharma money bought some big television to put in the new home, Trish gave us both personalized pendants. And of course, how could I forget what you got me?\u201d\n\nI elbow Naser a few times, trying to goat him into saying what he got me as a wedding gift himself, before he begrudgingly decides to accept it and put it out there,\n\u201cI got you a bottle of \u2018Skinnie Whisky from the Hood\u2019.\u201d He chuckles a bit more, shaking his head as he though back to the gifts given in the past, like that monkey jacket I still kept tucked away in my closet in a garment bag, I ended up keeping that bottle he gave me though the whisky inside it was long gone by now.\n\n\u201cThanks for helping keep me posted while I was out at college, must\u2019ve been nice being able to go to med school locally.\u201d\nNaser returns a warm smile and a short nod, \u201cIt has its ups and downs, didn\u2019t need a dorm and got to stay with my family when Fang needed me around the most, but Raptor Jesus I will not miss the commute to downtown Volcaldera every time I had to go to classes, had to leave home thirty minutes earlier than expected just to get there on time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least you didn\u2019t have to deal with campus meals for the most part then, overpriced and under seasoned trash it was. I was probably healthier at the end of the day buying those instant meals and ramen packs than I was trying to wrestle nutrition out of the stuff they served.\u201d\n\nNaser leans in with a grin, patting me on the shoulder,\n\u201cYeah yeah, couldn\u2019t be any worse than that slop they called vegan options back at Volcano High though, could it?\u201d\n\nI would laugh at his response but I half to prevent myself from retching first, visualizing that off-color gruel looking nonsense they served so often in that line, how could they ever get a meal like that approved by a school board, no less what kind of sane person would even cook it when shown the recipe? I take another glance over to check on the kiddos, still there and still as lively as when they started, the two of them racing down parallel slides before Lucy dashes off to a small climbing wall with Ozzy giving chase, having recovered his sword from her at some point.\n\nI let out a soft sigh as I recovered from the thought of vomit inducing food, trying my best to reminisce about much better things than death on a plate,\n\u201cAt least I was able to come back during the major breaks to spend time with you all, really helped with keeping in touch and seeing where people were going in life. One of those beach trips was when I found out you and Olivia had started dating, and now here we all are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really hit it off, ended up getting hitched while I was still in med school, haven\u2019t looked back once to even wonder what it would have been like if I tried stick with Naomi.\u201d\n\nI grin, thinking back on Naomi, getting back at her during prom and all was great, seeing that look of frustration as Fang stole her spotlight on the stage that night was priceless. Even if she had pushed Fang and I together back then she did an equally terrible job of making Fang herself happy. Everything Naomi ever did was more about herself than anyone else, and I\u2019m glad Naser finally realized that when they split. By this point in my thoughts, I 've swapped my smile for more of a scowl, realizing just how close Naomi was to truly ruining everything for Fang if neither of us became privy to it, if-\n\n\u201cHey, Anon, everything alright man?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m dragged out of the dark recesses of my mind by Naser\u2019s query, back into the bright gleaming light of the sunny day, shaking my head a bit back and forth as I look back over to him.\n\u201cYeah, just thinking about some bad memories from the past, nothing to worry about really.\u201d\n\nHe immediately sees through my dismissive remark, chuckling a bit as his hand reaches over to pat my back,\n\u201cIt\u2019s over how Naomi nearly ran you and Fang into the ground isn\u2019t it? Might as well just let it go at this point, thankfully she\u2019s not our problem anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill with Kanyesaurus I bet, wonder if he\u2019s going to try yet again in \u201832, bombed out hard this time around so I\u2019d be surprised if he even tried.\u201d\n\nNaser gives me a nod of agreement, looking back out upon the playground where our kids are before turning to me,\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve given you enough thanks for all the help you gave us back then, not just Fang, but all of us really.\u201d\n\nI feel like I had heard that enough by now to feel I had earned my thanks, but Naser seemed insistent on continuing with his statement,\n\u201cI just tried my best to be me, to help out where I could with what I felt could handle really.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and you did that instead of just sitting back and watching everything fall to pieces, you stepped up. The choices you made that year saved Fang from likely becoming some tattoo covered down on her luck girl who could only get stage time in shady dive bars. The band still exists today because of you helping them out, it may just be only a hobby for them now but Fang Trish and Reed still love every moment of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come on Naser, don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t help the band as well, half the time you are moonlighting as an agent for them to get them those shows in the first place, give yourself some credit as well!\u201d\nHe shakes his head at my response,\n\u201cAnon where do you think I\u2019d be if you didn\u2019t help out as well? I\u2019d probably still work in medicine but I\u2019d spend a lot of my time just checking patient intake to make sure my sister didn\u2019t turn up badly hurt or worse.\u201d\n\nJust having these thoughts implanted in me of Fang going down such a path was sickening enough to me, her becoming just another drug addicted dino, working less than stellar jobs she doesn\u2019t care for, giving up on music as a whole. How would I even approach her if I had made the wrong moves in my life and caused that? How would I even go about making things right be her if that had happened? Whatever, doesn\u2019t matter and thinking about it doesn\u2019t change the fact that she didn\u2019t end up going down such a path, she\u2019s happy and full of life today working a job she\u2019s passionate about with friends and family she holds dear to her. Just then I hear a short text tone coming from my phone, pulling it out of my pocket I notice a new text from Fang, speak of the angel.\n\n>Hey dweeb, got a pic of the kids having fun for me?\n\nOf course, she wanted pics, right forgot about that. I draw the phone up and select the camera while spotting the two tykes messing around, at this point I assume the pirate and princess have settled their differences as they were joyfully playing with a seesaw together. Lucy must get her energy from her mother as well, by now I would have probably keeled over on a swing gasping for air and begging for mercy. I snap a couple of pics of the kids before sending them off to Fang, imagining all of the cute noises she\u2019s likely going to make upon seeing them. I return my phone back into my pocket, smiling warmly as I continued watching the two play.\n\n\u201cYou ever miss the days where you could run around without a care in the world, Naser? Back when there were no responsibilities and you could just enjoy yourself day after day?\u201d\n\nHe looks up to the sky, contemplating the question a bit before replying back,\n\u201cYeah at times I do miss being able to just do what I wanted day in and out, but I wouldn\u2019t trade what I have now to go back to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way I\u2019d want to go back to them now, I\u2019d give up every last bit of free time that I have in my life if it meant getting to spend the entirety of it with Fang and Lucy. The two of them mean the world to me, I can\u2019t imagine going forward in life without them in it. I bet you feel the same way towards Olivia and Ozzy, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d Naser replies with a short chuckle, \u201cI\u2019d work every day of my life from here out to keep them safe and provide for them, even if it meant doing something I don\u2019t enjoy as much as what I do now, it\u2019d all be worth it for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good times behind us at this point, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be more in the future of course. It\u2019s good to remember them but we probably shouldn\u2019t dwell on the past for too long.\u201d\n\nHe nods while following along with my philosophical mumbo jumbo before replying and continuing it, \u201cBest to focus on the days ahead and what we can do to make them just as special as the days gone by, especially for our families, make sure every new day is a diamond for them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to not laugh at his response but I manage to rein myself in enough to avoid it. Taking another glance over at the kids I see them together on the swings, side by side, faces full of joy. I can\u2019t help but just sit there and watch, seeing Lucy and Ozzy enjoying themselves without a care in the world, I\u2019m nearly moved to tears just thinking of all the things there is left to do, with my wife, my daughter, my family. My thought time is once again interrupted by Naser, giving me a stiff pat on the back, smiling over at me\n\n\u201cYou wanna go join them, Anon? We\u2019ve been sitting here chatting for fifteen minutes now.\u201d\n\nI return that smile right back to him, along with that pat on the back before standing up, \u201cYeah, I think we should.\u201d Naser follows suit, standing up with me as we head over to the kids to join in on the fun.\n\nOur kids.\nMy family.\nMy happiness.","Title":"A Day At The Park","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Naser, Amber, Ozzy and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"A Father's Gratitude.txt":{"path":["Multiple","A Father's Gratitude.txt"],"text":"Title: A Father's Gratitude\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Naser, Ripley and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n*Ripley picks up his phone and calls Anon*\n\"Hello?\"\n\"Anon, it's Ripley, Lucy's Dad\"\n\"Oh, uh, hey Mr. Aron, how's it going?\"\n\"Anon, I need ya to just, shut up and listen\"\n\"If yer calling after Fang she's not here, I think she's with Tri-\"\n\"Anon, shut up\"\n\"...\"\n\"Anon, I'm ... a traditional guy, I know how I like things, and I know how \"my\" world works, to me, there wasn't any of this intraspecies nonsense you young'uns are all about today, and ya know, it's kinda scary, especially for a Father of a sweet lil' girl I feel I'm losing my grasp on\"\n\"...\"\n\"My sweet lil' Lucy's growing up, and I aint never felt further away from her, until you came along, she's been talkative, less angry and just, I feel like I've got my daughter back somedays, she even watched a crappy movie with me just two nights ago, d'ya know how long it's been since I felt less like her caretaker and more like her Dad?\"\n\"I can''t imagine\"\n\"Too long son, way too long\"\n\"...\"\n\"Look, what I'm tryin' to say is, thank you, Anon, for helping my sweet lil' Lucy through some of the things I was too fucking dense to help her with, you uh, you make her happy, and that ... makes me happy\"\n\"Mr. Aron, I appreciate it, but-\"\n\"But what?\"\n\"We, we aren't dating Mr. Aron, I kept telling you\"\n\"C'mon quit pullin' my chain Skinnie-\"\n\"We aren't, I swear on my life me and Fang are not dating\"\n\"...

No sex ensues.\n\n\n[Prologue]\n\n\"Do we really have to?\" Anon asked his ptero girlfriend, with a great deal of anguish in his voice.\n\nThe human could imagine dozens, nay, hundreds of better ways to spend his Friday night than another game night at Stella's. Falling into a coma for instance. Yet they were only minutes away from arriving at the dreaded destination.\n\n\"Yeah, lighten up dork! Last time wasn't that bad.\"\n\n\"It wasn't?\" he asked in a sarcastic tone \"Wow! Could have fooled me.\"\n\nAll the response he got was a prominent middle finger.\n\nHis thoughts flew back to the so-called \"last time\". \"Last time\" they've spent six excruciating hours trying to start a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, and yet barely managing to even set up characters for everyone. Fang's apparent clinging to make a pirate princess class might have caused that. Stella proved an unbelievably lenient game master to let her do that, though it ended up with them going through four versions of the DM manual from 3.0 onwards, piecing together traits and whatnot.\n\nEven Anon, accustomed to roleplaying games as he was, found the process incredibly boring. He had no idea how the others tolerated it. Most of the players - him included - chose their classes in mere minutes. He, simpleton of mind, went with warrior. Or maybe it had something to do with him not wanting to dress his character in robes or tight leather like some kind of faggot. Trish, mere seconds after his choice picked warrior as well, proclaiming that they will need someone to actually do the job right.\n\n*Fuck you too, Trish* Anon thought at that.\n\nBefore Fang could snatch her away, Stella recommended Naser to be a paladin, so he stuck with that. Rosa eventually became their cleric. Naomi took forever to pick from all of the caster classes, ending up at sorceress. Surprisingly, Reed took his sweet time too, looking at the list of skills and whatnot. Stella told him that he ought to be a rogue, seeing that the party had none. Alas, Reed wanted to be a bard. Anon, understanding the implications of the choice practically felt the inner facepalm of the lime stego. To her credit, she's tried her best to turn Fang's pirate princess into a rogue-ish character. Though by definition it was very hard not to make it into a dashing swordsman, god forbid a party with two bards.\n\nA question arose within Anon. Okay, they've set up the party. But were all the players even gonna be there that night? After the disaster that was their first attempt, he could easily imagine his friends coming up will all sorts of colorful excuses.\n\n\"Who's coming this time?\" he asked.\n\n\"What do you mean? Everyone is.\" Fang answered, amused at Anon's idea that people would ditch \"Not everyone likes to sit at home like you.\"\n\n\"Ow, shots fired.\"\n\nHe tried to play it off casually, but the words got to him. What if he preferred staying at home? There was nothing wrong with that. For the remainder of their short trip, neither of them spoke up. Although it was pretty obvious that Fang was excited, her short tail playing a non-stop beat on the bus seat. It made Anon want to tug on it so badly, but he's learned his lesson on that.\n\nDo NOT pull a dino's tail without permission. Especially if it's short. He suspected that there might be some size-queen thing going on with tails, but he never dared to ask. Nonetheless, it was his headcanon that Stella was walking around with the equivalent of double-D funbags. And uh, he did not want to consider Reed on that.\n\nTheir stop soon came to view, and it was only a couple of blocks to Stella's place from there. It was a nice, quiet neighborhood in the suburbs. Neatly trimmed green grass and hedges as far as the eye could see, a couple of kids still running around despite the sun setting momentarily. It wasn't actually that far from Fang's home either, the only reason they had to take a bus was cause they were ditching the last period to play Xrox, and also very much not to play Xrox, at Anon's shitty apartment on the other side of town.\n\nAs they rounded the last corner, Fang suddenly stopped, looking around with an intense look.\n\n\"Shit!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"What? What is it?\" Anon asked nervously.\n\n\"Wasn't there a convenience store somewhere around here? We should like, bring some munchies or something.\"\n\nThat was a fair point. Although Stella was the hostess, it would be rude to arrive without at least some snacks. He had no earthly idea if there was a store nearby though, so he told Fang about that much. A quick look at his watch confirmed that they'd be totally late if they start going in circles now.\n\n\"Ugh, whatever then. We'll just say it was your fault for taking so long to get dressed.\"\n\nAnon's retort came quick. With Naser there, he definitely did not want to say anything even remotely implying that they've had sex.\n\n\"Yeah, how about we don't do that? I'd prefer not to get beat up by your brother.\"\n\n\"Whatever, dweeb. Then make some shit up.\"\n\n*Easier said than done* he thought, but he didn't object.\n\nIn fact, he tried his very best to think his way out of the conundrum all the way up to Stella's front door, to no avail. The doorbell chimed its pleasant tune, and ultimately Anon concluded that the best course of action seemed to be just apologizing, and keeping their reasons for themselves. That should work.\n\n\"Stella! More of your friends are here!\" A man's voice came from the inside.\n\nA few seconds later the door opened, and Stella's dad greeted the duo. The best Anon could describe him was \"plain\". Jeans, a neatly buttoned checkerboard shirt, short hair, framed glasses, clean scales. There was not a single memorable trait about him. They've met him last time too, and at first Anon would not believe he was one of Stella's parents. He imagined the entire family to be into mysticism, spirituality, the occult, Japanese culture, or all of the above. They were extraordinarily plain, so the fact that Stella ended up as she did begged for an explanation.\n\nSoon after Anon and Fang were let inside, the familiar figure of their stego friend appeared. She's already donned her dungeon master attire, a purple robe complete with a pointy hat. She quickly thanked her dad, allowing him to go about his own business.\n\n\"Oh hey, guys! Come, come, we were all waiting for you!\"\n\n\"Yeah, sorry\" Fang replied, looking at Anon expectantly.\n\n\"Yea uh, we didn't look at the time cause we were fucking.\"\n\nThe awkward sentence hung in the air between them. Even Stella's dad turned back around at the end of the hallway, making Anon question his own sanity. Of all the times, why did his retardation have to betray him now? To add insult to injury, Stella didn't seem to understand.\n\n\"You were effing what?\" she asked, confused.\n\nThe apparent silence, combined with their embarrassed looks was response enough, and Stella's face soon went up in crimson too.\n\n\"O-oh, haha... Well um...\" Stella, bless her heart, tried to somehow get on top of the situation \"T-there are some, um, drinks in the fridge, and um, the others are already downstairs.\"\n\nWith that she stepped away from the duo, shooing her dad away awkwardly. As soon as Stella turned her back to them, Fang gave Anon such a death-stare that he was surprised he didn't go up in flames on the spot.\n\nThe rest of the evening went more or less without incident. After some smalltalk and catching up with rumors, the participants once again turned their attention to the game at hand. Stella was absolutely ecstatic. They all pulled out their respective character sheets, and their enthusiastic game master handed out small plastic figures for each of them. After that Stella dimmed the lights and climbed on top of her chair, towering over the party ominously. Or rather as ominously as a bubbly girl like she could, with that stupid hat and all.\n\n\"Welcome, adventurers!\" she began her speech in a deepened voice, trying to sound mysterious.\n\nTo Anon's surprise, there were a couple \"Yeah!\"-s, and \"Whoo!\"-s, one coming from none other than Fang. At some point, she's also asked Stella for an eyepatch, and now looked completely enthralled with the game.\n\n\"You have been summoned by the famous good witch Stellior, to embark on a great and perilous journey! And yet you must, for only the seven of you can save the realm from complete destruction! You must defeat the evil shapeshifting warlock, known only as Ko'upe before he could usher in eternal darkness! You have to make your way to his fortress on top of the icy mountains, surrounded by dark forests and deadly marshes! There, you will need to collect all seven pieces of his soul and destroy them! But fear not, heroes, for I, the good witch Stellior will use my magic to keep you safe! Behold, the book of Loley!\"\n\nAt that point, Stella produced a book from under her robes. Even at first glance, Anon could tell that it was pretty old. The pages had that distinct yellow color to them, and the binding itself looked all wrinkled and leathery. Truth be told, upon closer inspection, it looked very much like old, dried skin. But it couldn't be, right?\n\n\"Stella, what the hell is that?\" he asked, somewhat concerned.\n\n\"I don't know who this 'Stella' is, for I am the good witch Stellior! And I'll let you know that it is a great and ancient artifact, from the dungeon of um... Int Ernet!\"\n\nShe sounded clearly annoyed that Anon would break immersion right in the middle of her story. He wasn't convinced though.\n\n\"Ugh fine! I got it from the same site I got my Ouija board from, okay? Can we continue now?\"\n\n\"Woah, is that safe?\" Rosa interjected.\n\n\"Are you serious?\" Fang asked \"Are you afraid of a toy?\"\n\nAn argument lasting for several minutes ensued, only ending when Stella loudly threw the book on the table. She looked at her friends, cheeks puffed out in her anger that her game got so rudely interrupted.\n\n\"AHEM! FEAR NOT, HEROES, AND BEHOLD THE BOOK OF LOLEY!\"\n\nEveryone promptly shut up, and Stella could finally continue her speech. She opened up the book on a seemingly random page, and started reading - or pretending to be reading - some gibberish mumbo-jumbo. It made Anon sit up and inspect the book closer. All he could make out was written in some fantasy language, complete with weird, accented letters that he's never seen.\n\n*Szia Uram! J\u00f3l beszoptad \u00f6reg, rem\u00e9lem cs\u00edped a lolit mer' ha nem akkor nyeled a brokit.*\n\nIt was exceedingly hard to read, and for some weird reason it seemed to get harder the more he tried. The letters started to mesh together, jumping around on the page. He blinked a few times, trying to focus, only to find that the book itself, the table, the room, and her friends in it were quickly blending together into a cacophony of colors. His heartbeat quickened. He tried to yell, to stand up, but all power left his body.\n\nOnly the darkness remained.\n\n\n[Chapter I]\n\nThe golden glow of sunshine shining over his closed eyelids felt incredibly comforting, same as the gentle caress of the grass and the light breeze of the wind. It was all perfect, he could lay there all afternoon. But then someone had to ruin it. Not far from him some obnoxious child just had to pick that exact time to start crying. Loudly.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, a shadow towered over him, blocking the sun.\n\n\"Come on Anon, geth up!\"\n\nBy the sounds alone, it was some little girl. Did he pass out in a daycare? What the hell? Although this voice sounded familiar, kinda like Fang's. Not that Anon really cared. Only so few things could compel him to get up, and a child surely wasn't one of them.\n\n\"Go away!\" he tried to protest.\n\nThere was something wrong, however. His own voice sounded different somehow. Just wrong. More chipper and with a higher pitch. Eerily like how he sounded as a little kid.\n\nAs if there was a spring in place of his spine he sat up, opening his eyes. After a brief flash of blinding sunlight, a meadow came into view. Several bodies were scattered around it, in various stages of getting up.\n\nAll of them, children. All of them, he knew. And all of them wearing alarmingly medieval-fantasy-looking clothing. The crying apparently came from a minified version of Trish. Fortunately, an also smaller yet way fattier Rosa quickly waddled up to her, cradling Trish's head in a motherly way.\n\nLooking down at his own body with widened eyes, a pair of short, lanky legs greeted him. He was also wearing some kind of armor, just like the others. He brought one of his gloved hands in front of his face. Moving his arm felt weird, as if all the weights were in the wrong place. His reach was also much shorter.\n\n\"Geth up, dummy!\" Fang demanded again.\n\nStill in his panicked state, Anon looked at his girlfriend. In place of the slender and sexy visage, a slightly puffy and freckled face looked back at him. Fang's hair played the same silvery color, except it was cut much shorter and the front ended in bangs just above her eyes - one of which was covered by an eyepatch. The oft-irritated expression she usually held was also missing in favor of a toothy grin, which was just one incisor short of perfect. It also explained why she had problems with the \"t\" sounds.\n\nThe usual punk-goth attire of Fang was all gone, though that made sense with everyone wearing robes or armor. This Fang wore some weird cross between a maid's outfit, and what a pirate would wear, topped with a tiara. Pirate princess, was it?\n\nAbsurd as the situation was, Anon couldn't suppress his laughter. It came out more like a squirrel squeaking, but he enjoyed it nonetheless.\n\n\"Wow Fang, you are a real pirate now!\" he laughed.\n\nShe grimaced at the sarcastic remark, sticking her tongue out.\n\n\"Geth up or I'm going tho hith you on the head!\" she threatened Anon in the same lispy albeit now annoyed tone.\n\nNot heeding the warning, Anon started squeaking that much harder. Before Fang could do good on her promise and bring her fist down, Anon wised up. Throwing his hands in the air to signal surrender, he instead focused on getting up from the ground.\n\nIt wasn't an easy process. Just like his arms before, the rest of his body felt strange and wrong, uncooperative. The weight of the armor wasn't helping either. Although as the seconds passed, he could swear that the metal garb started feeling as part of his body rather than a cumbersome shell around it. The straps stopped biting into his skin, the sheathe of his sword settled in its trusty place rather than dangling about, his red cloak an old companion than a stranger hindering his movements. The heat, oppressive at first, felt cozy and protective. By the time he got up, he really felt like a knight in shining armor. Even with how short he was compared to his adult form, he was still a good head taller than pirate princess Fang.\n\nLooking around on the grassy field, he could see their friends gathered up around Trish, who by then had stopped crying. Motioning at Fang to follow, he made his way there too. It was really uncanny to see the party like that. Fang's cute tomboyish form wasn't such a big surprise, he saw photos of her afterall. Rosa - not counting the horizontal stretch - didn't really change that much. Her hair got a bit shorter maybe, plus she was covered in plate armor, a lot heavier than Anon's chainmail. Complete with a mace and shield.\n\nTrish was another deal altogether. The trike was wearing the same gear as Anon, but she's also donned a pair of glasses so thick that her eyes were almost invisible behind them. Her hair was cut a lot shorter than before, more or less a monk's cut without the bald spot. Her horns were little more than nubs on her face, almost imperceptible among the forest of zits and pimples. If Anon had to put it in a single word, Trish looked like a nerd. And a pathetic one at that. Steve Urkel could probably beat her up. For a moment he wondered where that name came from. He didn't know anyone like that.\n\nNaser was pretty much her polar opposite. He looked just as athletic as ever, standing tall proudly. He was about equal height to Anon, and seemed to be covered in the same heavy armor as Rosa. Except he was wielding a huge two-handed hammer. It had to be heavy as all hell, but the ptero paladin was keeping it upright with a single hand. The biggest change however was his wings though, or at least Anon felt like they were. He couldn't really put his finger on it, but somehow the pair of wings seemed out of place.\n\nNext on the roster was Naomi, cowering behind her boyfriend's back. She was a cross somewhere between Trish and Fang, although Anon wasn't sure how else she could look. Afterall, it was always how she's been. Definitely thin, though Anon couldn't exactly call her sickly. Her hair was flowing freely down to her waist. Her face - and Anon hated himself for making this comparison - was that of an angel. No unchecked eczema, like the one decorating Trish, and no puffiness like Fang's. She was nothing short of perfect, other than her glasses. They were a bit on the heavy side, but more elegant than unattractive. The only thing not doing any favors for the young girl were her robes, which were so baggy that they looked a size too big for her.\n\nReed was the last one to waltz into the picture. Clad in leather armor and strumming lightly on a wooden ukulele, which seemed to be his only means of self-defense. Anon somehow felt like he should be making a comparison here, yet he couldn't for the life of him figure out to what. Reed was Reed, their bard.\n\nIn any case, they weren't getting one bit closer to their objective by wasting time sitting around. Ko'upe was on the move! Looks like Fang was on the same track, cause she stepped forward, forcefully pulling Trish from the ground.\n\n\"Come on now Thish, we have tho go!\"\n\n\"Ugh, but I don't wanna!\" the small trike protested.\n\n\"Fang is right, Trish\" Naser said in a scolding manner \"We have to save the world!\"\n\n\"But I wanna go home!\"\n\nA collective sigh of frustration escaped everyone's lips as Trish crossed her arms on her tiny chest. It was once again Fang who tried breaking past the barrier.\n\n\"Ith's okay Thish. You can go home afther we saved the world, all righth?\"\n\nFor some unexplainable reason, the words \"charisma check\" danced to the front of Anon's brain. He didn't really understand, but it was a fleeting thought anyway. Luckily Trish deflated too, looking down at her feet bashfully.\n\n\"O-okay Fang.\"\n\n\"That's more like ith, soldier!\" Fang exclaimed cheerfully \"Adventhure awaiths!\"\n\nWithout any more hindrances, the seven of them formed a line behind Naser and returned to the road beside the meadow. Their break was over, the quest remained. It could very well have been their last pleasant stop, for soon they'd arrive at the cold and harsh land of Cisylvania, home of vampires, werewolves, and all sorts of nasties!\n\n* * *\n\nAs the day turned to evening, so the small group arrived at their first checkpoint. A town, built right on the edge of the dark forest, by the foot of the mountains. Something told Anon that it used to be a popular trading hub once, back when the trees cast pleasant summer shade and not the unnerving wintery shadow they did then. He had no idea how he could know something like that though, maybe he read it somewhere? Be as it may, those days were long gone. What he was sure of is that business moved from the mountainous region as it filled with monsters.\n\nThe town was guarded by high stone walls, the cracks between the heavy cobblestones laden with moss. As the party approached, the guards on the catwalk trained their bows on them. None of them were older than fifteen, although Anon wasn't sure why he had to make that remark. It was just natural, so he felt rather foolish for it. Something just didn't feel right ever since he woke up on the meadow.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" the stern voice of a girl sounded from above.\n\nThe party lined up in front of the gates, and Naser stepped forward.\n\n\"We're adventurers! Please let us in!\" he called out to the girl.\n\n\"Why would I do that?\"\n\nA fair question, yet one that Naser didn't seem to have an answer to. Their mission was a secret one, after all. Reed, the charmer of the group had it handled, however.\n\n\"He said please!\" he yelled, playing a few notes on his instrument.\n\nThe guards looked at one another, nodding in mutual understanding. The girl who was most likely their captain held off for a few seconds, but ultimately didn't have a problem with them entering.\n\nThus, the gates opened, leading our heroes to a small square filled with teens going about their business. Only so few of them spared the group any notice. On all sides of the square sturdy stone cottages rose over them, most two or even three stories high. They emitted a safe, cozy atmosphere until Anon looked at them better. Then he saw that the guards were protecting little more than rubble with all of the boarded-up windows, and dilapidated, caved-in rooftops.\n\n\"Alrighth guys, whath do we do now?\" Fang asked, climbing up on a bench and placing her hands on her hips as if asking for a challenge.\n\n\"Maybe we should find a place to sleep?\" Trish suggested quietly.\n\n\"I vote yes!\" Naomi added posthaste \"I am tired of all the ick and muck! I want to sleep in a bed! Furthermore, I want to cuddle my little witwe Naser-waser-sweetiepie!\"\n\nA loud \"EWW\" echoed through the square in response to the lovey-dovey comment. Anon acted like he was gonna get sick too, just to drive home the point. Naomi stuck her snout up, offended.\n\nNaser-waser-sweetiepie took charge of the situation after that, his face only slightly red.\n\n\"I think we should split up. Trish, Rosa, go get some supplies. We'll need gear to climb the mountains, and I also want gummy bears!\"\n\n\"Me too!\" Reed interjected, prompting everyone to add their wish to the list.\n\n\"I want hot choccie!\" Rosa exclaimed, last in line - then it dawned on her that she was the one going to the store anyway.\n\n\"...Okay, so\" Naser continued \"Naomi and me will go get us rooms somewhere. Don't make any trouble, okay?\"\n\n\"Whath abouth us?\" Fang asked her brother, upset that she got left out.\n\nFang crossed her arms in front of her chest like Trish did not long ago, puffing out her reddened cheeks. Yet whereas Trish looked like a sore loser, Anon found Fang incredibly cute. Not that he was ever gonna tell her, cause that was sappy girly stuff.\n\nMeanwhile Naser thought about what task to give the trio, but he came up empty. Of course that wasn't nearly good enough for Fang, so she grabbed Anon by the hand and started dragging him away.\n\n\"Come on Anon, we're gonna geth thice as much gummy bears than sthupid Naser!\"\n\n* * *\n\nAnd so, the two of them left the group behind. Fang was huffing and puffing for a while longer still, yet after wading through what was practically a labyrinth of back-alleys and narrow streets, she gave up on trying to find a candy store. Anon was secretly thankful for that, his arm started hurting from Fang's relentless tugging on it.\n\nThe two of them entered a park-looking area, complete with a fountain in the middle. There were a few lanterns hanging from the wrought iron lampposts, almost all of them lit. Not many weeds either, and the bushes were all trimmed. Whoever lived around here, it seemed like they weren't gonna let their neighborhood become a ruin like those houses near the gates.\n\nFang climbed up onto the wide stone wall of the fountain, laying down with a tired moan. Anon sat up beside her.\n\n\"Ahh, this is pointhess!\" she exhaled \"We're never gonna geth gummy bears here!\"\n\n\"It's okay, Fang. Rosa and Trish are gonna get them!\"\n\nShe gave Anon a look of disbelief, as if the human didn't yet figure out that it wasn't really about the candy. But oh, he knew. He knew very well how stubborn Fang could be, and how she must have hated that Naser handled her like a stupid little girl. Not that Anon could blame him, not a lot anyway. Nine times out of ten Fang was just a sillypants, and not someone you'd trust with your shopping.\n\n\"Do you wanna share a room with me, Anon?\" she asked suddenly.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"A room ath the inn! I wanth us to geth a room thogether!\" Fang explained as she sat up, eyeing Anon coyly.\n\n\"B-but!\" Anon felt week at the knees, his voice cracking \"But what about Rosa a-and Trish?\"\n\n\"I don'th wanna share a room with smelly Rosa or stupid Thish! I wanna share a room with you so thath's thath!\"\n\n\"B-but I didn't even say yes!\"\n\nDespite his protest, he knew that it was already decided. If Fang wanted something then she'd get that something. More often than not when the something was Anon. Funny that.\n\n\"Come on Anon, ith's gonna be so cool! We can sthay up lathe and eath ice-cream!\"\n\n\"But Fang we don't have ice-cream!\"\n\n\"Fine, then we can kiss!\"\n\n\"W-what?! Eww!\"\n\nHis face went up bright red in an instant, sweat forming on his bald head. If there was one thing he didn't know how to handle, it was girls. Well, there were several things he couldn't handle, but girls were the worst of it. To make matters worse, it was Fang. The two of them have been thick as thieves these last few weeks, but kissing?!\n\n\"Whath, do you like boys?\" Fang asked in a mocking tone.\n\n\"N-no...!\"\n\n\"Anon likes bo~oys, Anon likes bo~oys!\" she stared chanting.\n\n\"No! I like girls!\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, then prove ith!\"\n\n\"Fine!\"\n\nWithout a second more hesitation, determined and fuelled by his sudden rage against Fang's mockery, he leaned in and placed a smooch on the ptero girl's cheek. He felt very confident. Victorious. Now he showed her! Alas, Fang didn't seem even a bit fazed. Not even blushing, how was that possible?\n\n\"Nuh-uh Anon, thath doesn't counth! Ith has tho be a proper kiss!\"\n\n\"Fine!\"\n\nOnce again, he leaned forward. A lot slower this time, closing his eyes too. Or maybe he should open them? Okay, he opened one of them. But Fang was looking back! Oh no!\n\nHe closed his eyes again. Would he have to lean in closer? But Fang had a snout, so... W-was he gonna have to use tongue?\n\nBefore he could think more on it, something pressed up against his lips. In that instant, the world seemed to slip away from around him. Quite literally. The coldness of the stone was gone, the heat contained within his armor as well. The chirping of the crickets and the noises of the streets. All but him in the darkness, in a body that felt much more familiar.\n\nOnce again, he was a young adult. Looking around, the darkness stretched on endlessly. At least that's how it felt to Anon, though in the pitch black there very well could have been a wall right in front of him. He reached out, trying to grasp onto something. Anything.\n\nBefore panic could have set it, another figure appeared. It was Fang, but not the one he was kissing. This Fang was grown up, and in her normal torn goth clothing. She caught Anon's stretched-out hand, running her slender fingers through his.\n\nAs she did, color returned to the world. They were in a room, her room. Guitars on the walls, scent of menthol cigarettes in the air. But more importantly, the feeling of safety, happiness, and perhaps excitement? It must have been the first time Anon saw that room. Before midterms. Fang was about to offer her guitar to him, and he'd have to decide if they should study instead.\n\nHe didn't know what to think or feel anymore. One scene came after another, memories or dreams, detailing his life with Fang, Reed, Naser, and all the rest of them. In mids of the feverish visions, one voice singled out of the chaos. It sounded familiar too, but he couldn't place it.\n\n\"Hurry Anon! The fate of this universe is in your hands! You are my only hope!\"\n\n* * *\n\n\"Rosa, what are we gonna do?\"\n\nThe little trike followed her cleric friend like sheep follow their shepherd. Their hunt for a candy store hasn't been going too well. Thankfully, the two of them were responsible enough to put sweets at the end of their shopping list. Their backpacks were nearly bursting with warm clothes, climbing gear, camping supplies, and food.\n\n\"Kalma, Trish, kalma!\" Rosa said, without even a hint of worry in her voice \"You just should have faith in our Lord. Good children get candy, naughty ones do not.\"\n\n\"Wow Rosa, I didn't know you worshipped Santa Claus!\" Trish responded with a cheeky grin.\n\n\"What I meant to say,\" the cleric explained patiently \"was that if you have no faith in the Lord, there is no reason for Him to reward you. But if you do, you'll get your happiness eventually. Sencillo como eso.\"\n\nAs if to give emphasis to her words, Rosa turned one last corner and blindly hurried to the first building on the row. Trish was more than hesitant to follow, calling out to her friend from the bottom of the stone steps leading to the door.\n\n\"I dunno Rosa, this doesn't look like a candy shop to me\" she whined, looking at the flagon-shaped sign on the wall.\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure they'll serve you a glass of milk.\"\n\nThere was some urgency in Rosa's voice and she was eyeballing the street they just came from, putting the triceratops at unease.\n\n\"B-but...\"\n\nEither Rosa didn't see the tension building up behind Trish's thick glasses or she just didn't care. She took the trike by the hand, dragging her inside. Dozens of eyes turned their way as they practically tore the door off its hinges. The tavern was packed with people, some as young as five, but others on the older side of their teens. After the awkward entry, Rosa waddled up to the counter silently, with Trish almost gripping her tail in fear as she followed.\n\n\"Rosa I don't like this!\" the trike whispered.\n\nOnce again, the orange dino paid her friend no heed. Not until they've been served a couple of glasses of warm sugary milk, and been seated at a more or less clean table. After a few minutes have passed and the other patrons lost their interest in the duo, Rosa took one last look at the door, then turned to Trish. The warrior has never seen her friend this serious.\n\n\"Don't freak out, but I think someone was following us.\" Rosa whispered.\n\n\"W-WHAT?!\"\n\n\"Shhhhhh!\"\n\nA few guests shot annoyed glances their way, but fortunately nobody seemed really care.\n\n\"It's okay Trish, I think we've lost them.\"\n\nTrish didn't respond, instead took a few loud gulps of her drink. Her hands were shaking so badly that she almost spilled the beverage multiple times. As the initial shock subsided, she tried to rationalize it to herself. They were on a quest of great importance. It would make sense that powerful people would be interested. At least it was only a spy, and not an assassin.\n\nHow long until it would be one, though?\n\n* * *\n\nReed was wandering the streets aimlessly, strumming on his ukulele without a care in the world. After Fang and Anon left, the party split up and everyone went to see their business done. All except for him, left to his own devices. He thought about going after Naser and Naomi, but he didn't want to bother the couple. Instead he picked a street at random, determined to find something worth his while.\n\nAs chance would have it, the road took him to a colorful market. Stalls lined the road from both sides, banners and lanterns hanging in the air between the houses, performers dancing and juggling on the corners. It was all he needed to get his mind off of their quest for a little while. Who needed that darkness stuff all day? It was time to have some fun!\n\nAs such, he's bought himself some candied apples, downing them one after the other. After about the fourth one, he stumbled upon a small crowd. They were all gathered up in front of a stage, upon which a band of actors was playing a scene. From what Reed could make out, it was some generic story about a princess needing rescue. It wasn't half bad, so he decided to watch till he finished his apples.\n\nIn the end though, he stayed for long after. As it turned out, the character he mistook for a princess earlier was the main heroine, and she was out on a quest to save her father, the king. Reed was quickly enamored with her headstrong antics and lovely freckled face. Of course, as he soon realized it was because of the uncanny resemblance to another freckled face he knew. Except this one had purple hair, feathers, and markings.\n\nAs the image of his ptero friend crossed Reed's mind, ache made its way to his heart. He's had a crush on Fang ever since they knew eachother, but the girl saw him no more than a friend. He shook his head, trying to banish these thoughts.\n\nReed returned his attention to the play, but he could only continue to watch for so long. In his eyes, the actress turned into Fang already, and there was no way he'd watch her get stolen away by this or that stupid knight or whatever. With a frown he tore away from the spectacle, this time deciding upon a dark, narrow-looking alley tucked in between a couple of run-down houses.\n\nThe laughs and woos of the crowd followed him for a few minutes, making him that much more mad. It was all stupid Anon's fault! Reed knew that any day now, he was gonna tell Fang about his feelings and she would be his girlfriend, but then that dumb human had to come along! What did Anon have that he didn't? Nothing! He was just a dumb skinnie! Why didn't Fang see that?\n\nAs these heavy thoughts permeated his mind, the young raptor made his way through the dark alleys. Eventually though, he made it to a more or less nice neighborhood, with lanterns once again shining down on the worn cobble road. He stopped and listened. Miraculously, he could still hear the actress, her voice so similar to Fang's.\n\nBut wait, no... That wasn't right. These sounds were coming from straight ahead. His anger, if not vanished, but subsided as curiosity took over. Slowly he inched his way to the nearest corner, where a high iron fence stopped him. Bushes blocked his way too, same as his vision. He was sure, however, that Fang's voice was coming from the other side. He could hear her clearly now.\n\n\"Come on Anon, ith's gonna be so cool! We can sthay up lathe and eath ice-cream!\"\n\nOf course she'd be with Anon. What were they planning?\n\n\"But Fang we don't have ice-cream!\"\n\n\"Fine, then we can kiss!\"\n\nWhat? The raptor's eyes widened. No way!\n\nHe missed Anon's reply, but he was sure the boy somehow tricked Fang into this! There was no way Fang would want to kiss a human! Eww!\n\nReed continued to listen as Fang teased Anon, goading him into a kiss. He refused to believe what was happening. A bit later as Fang yelled that she wanted a proper kiss was the last straw. Reed turned his back on his friends, returning to the dark alleys with a heavy chest.\n\nAt least in there, nobody would see him crying...\n\n* * *\n\nAbruptly as the vision came, so it passed.\n\n\"We're gonna be boyfriend and girlfriend!\" Anon blurted out.\n\n\"Deal!\"\n\n\"No, I mean I saw it! Like, in the future!\"\n\n\"Haha! I knew thath I was an amazing kisser!\" Fang teased, pouting.\n\nAt first, Anon frowned that Fang wasn't taking him seriously, but his annoyance quickly turned to panic. A few of his memories about the real world still lingered, but he could feel them slipping away again. He closed his eyes, trying to grasp even a single one of them. If he could, maybe he could make sense of the situation.\n\nSomehow, he ended up in this weird video-game-like limbo, straight out of an isekai anime. He had no idea how or why, and why Fang was with him. Was this even the real Fang? Could she remember the real world if he told her about the memories? After all, how could she forget about the time they... When they...\n\nTo his shock, the memory was gone already. Was it a happy one? Was it a sad one? Not even a morsel of it remained.\n\n\"Hey um, are you okay?\" Fang asked with a concerned voice.\n\nAnon opened his eyes again, looking at her. He knew there was something he wanted to ask the little pirate, but what it exactly was eluded him. Only that feeling of something being amiss endured.\n\n\"Do you ever feel like you're not who you're supposed to be?\" he asked.\n\nThe question prompted Fang to scoot closer to him, dangling her legs over the edge of the fountain. She looked down at her feet, thinking about her answer.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess...\" she said in a calm and soft voice, uncharacteristic from her.\n\nAnon felt tremendous relief that he wasn't going crazy after all, that there was something seriously wrong with the world. Only till Fang continued, however. Seemed like the young girl misread the question.\n\n\"Somethimes I think I should be a paladin like Naser, then I could beath up all the meanies!\"\n\n\"Um... That's not what I mean, Fang.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nHe had absolutely no idea how to translate his feelings into words.\n\n\"It's like... Okay, you know when you sit for a long time and your legs go like zzzzzzz?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh\"\n\n\"And then you can't move it right?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh\"\n\n\"Imagine if you're the leg!\"\n\n\"Anon thath makes no sense!\" she laughed.\n\nHe furrowed his brows, trying to explain it better.\n\n\"It's like when you know you should be a leg and move, but you're still zzzzzzzz and you can't and you're just a thing and not a leg, right?\"\n\nHe felt like that explanation should have more than sufficed, yet Fang just kept on laughing.\n\n\"...forget it...\" he mumbled.\n\nApparently Fang did just as much, getting up from the fountain and grabbing her brand new boyfriend by the hand yet again.\n\n\"Come on Anon, let's find the others before Naser puths me in a room with someone else!\"\n\n* * *\n\nAmazingly, Fang found their way straight back to the square where they've split up earlier. Reed was already - or maybe still - there, sitting on a bench and playing a melancholic tone. As if driven by some higher force, Rosa and Trish made their appearance in a matter of seconds too, swiftly followed by Naser and Naomi. After Fang very loudly announced that Anon was her boyfriend now, the seven of them made their way to the inn.\n\nObviously Naser has long booked their rooms, but Fang being Fang was adamant about sharing a room with Anon. In the end, Naser and Naomi had to give up their own room. This would have, of course, put Reed with the two other girls, who wouldn't have that. As such, it quickly ended up with Naser and Reed becoming impromptu roommates, same as the gaggle of the three girls. Everyone was clearly mad at Fang, but she didn't seem to care one bit.\n\nOnce the room situation was settled, the girls and Reed made their leave. Anon, Fang, and Naser on the other hand ordered some munchies, sitting down in a corner. Anon was amazed that Naomi would skip this opportunity to indulge herself, but then he realized that she must have already milked Naser for a fancy dinner. He also had his suspicions that Naser stayed with them both to make sure Fang didn't cause them to get thrown out, and mainly to give Anon the good ol' dead eyes for daring to seduce his sister.\n\nIt was weird to see the paladin like that, to Anon it always felt like the ptero boy didn't have a single bad bone in his body. Then again, Fang was his family. He couldn't muse himself on that for long though, as a stranger approached them. Clad in leather armor and a green cloak, skin dark like the night, pointed ears, and long silver hair. His face was sharp yet gentle, maybe a little feminine. Couldn't have been older than Anon, but it was hard to tell.\n\n\"Are you going to the mountains?\" the dark elf asked cautiously, skipping right past the formalities.\n\n\"We might.\" Naser spoke up \"I'm Naser. What is your name, friend?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. My name is Dizzit Dudden.\"\n\nA pause settled over the conversation, the trio waiting for Dizzit to speak up, and him to awkwardly hop from one leg to the other, seemingly unsure how to continue.\n\n\"Whath do you wanth?\" Fang snapped at the stranger impatiently.\n\nHe took a bit to respond, carefully considering what to say.\n\n\"You all look like adventurers, so if you're going to the mountains I would like to ask for a favor. I've lost my swords you see.\"\n\n\"Why not buy new ones? I'm sure there's a smith in this town.\" Naser pointed out.\n\n\"These swords are very special, both to me and on their own. They could cut through any armor.\"\n\nAnon's eyes widened at the claim, his heartbeat rising. He's heard of special swords like that, folded over a thousand times till they got strong enough to cut clean through iron and steel. All of the coolest heroes wielded swords like that! If he got one, he'd be just as cool and Fang couldn't call him a dweeb anymore!\n\n\"Okay!\" he blurted out.\n\nThe Arin siblings shot him a surprised glance, but he didn't care. He was gonna be the coolest swordsman ever!\n\nDrizzt on the other hand couldn't have been happier, unaware of Anon's shady motives. His awkwardness washed away in an instant, giving way for unbound enthusiasm as he started describing some sort of bandit camp, where his weapons would apparently be.\n\nThey chatted up for a while after that until their food was all gone, then bid farewell to the weird dark elf. Afterwards they all retreated to their rooms. Before Anon could have followed Fang inside, Naser pulled him to the side.\n\n\"Anon,\" he started out in a very serious, scolding tone \"I don't mind helping out those in need, but this is not our mission. We cannot have any delays, like running back and forth to town.\"\n\n\"Chill out Naser! It's not gonna take that long, and I don't even want to give the stupid swords back.\"\n\nUpon hearing that the paladin shoved Anon hard against the wall, seething with anger.\n\n\"You'd make me a liar?!\"\n\n\"Ugh fine, I'll give 'em back after, okay?\"\n\nAll he got was a stern look.\n\n\"Like, Trish and I could use better swords, okay? It's for the good of the mission!\"\n\nNaser didn't look one bit convinced, but he let go of Anon nonetheless. He gave the human one last shove for good measure, leaving him with a warning.\n\n\"Careful, Anon. We don't need two warriors in the party.\"\n\n* * *\n\n\"Whath was thath abouth?\" Fang asked as soon as Anon entered the room.\n\n\"Um, nothing.\"\n\nTry as he might, Naser's word shook him. He never considered that he'd get in trouble with his friends.\n\n\"Uh-huh, then Naser didn'th justh warn you tho sthay away from me?\"\n\n\"Huh? No.\"\n\n\"Anon, don'th you lie tho me!\"\n\nThe small ptero put her hands on her hips, acting like a mother telling off a bad child. She's already climbed on top of a bed too, as she usually did. Anon would have found it cute, were it not for the current situation. He felt like everyone suddenly turned on him, and it totally wasn't fair!\n\n\"Am not!\" Anon protested.\n\n\"Pinky promise?\"\n\nFang's serious gaze burned holes through him. What was it with them and lies? As if they never lied to anyone ever!\n\n\"Yeah!\"\n\nAs soon as the word left his mouth, Fang hopped down from the bed acting as if the whole interrogation didn't just happen.\n\n\"Whathcha wanna do? Wanna play a game?\"\n\nThe sudden change confused the Anon, but he was glad to let it go too.\n\nThe two of them ended up playing pretend pirates using Fang's - unloaded - pistols, and by Anon donning a makeshift eyepatch. Despite Fang's offer from earlier, there was no ice-cream nor make-out session. Anon was a little disappointed by the latter, but he was also glad to evade a possibly humiliating situation. He's never kissed anyone before, so he was sure to be horrible at it. They did go to sleep holding hands over the bed frame though.\n\nAlas, no matter how tired he was, sleep eluded him for quite a long time. As before, he had this weird sensation of not belonging, that he was somewhere he shouldn't be. On top of that, now he had this odd notion as if he was being watched.\n\n* * *\n\n\"Aww my brave hero, you're so close to the truth!\" the apparition thought, its immaterial body perched at the end of Anon's bed.\n\nIf only the human would reach out and see, this nightmare could be over already. It was wishful thinking though. People don't want to question their reality. They don't want to think that it's all a game, a veil put over their eyes. At least normal people didn't. The same could not be said about the one keeping the watcher captive. It was just around time the jailor would make his evening visit too, so it was high time to dispel the specter and return to the misery of the small cell.\n\nAnd so it was. In the highest reaches of the highest tower, on top of the highest mountain, the dark lord Ko'upe ascended the stairs to see his prisoner, his free ticket to the real world. He knew very well that this reality he's been bound to was little more than a fabrication. A tale to tell. If it wasn't for his immense willpower, surely he'd already given in to despair and crumble. To think that the entire world and all those in it came to existence a little less a day ago made his head spin. He himself refused to believe it at first, even if it was so obvious. With just a little bit of effort anyone could figure it out.\n\nChildren cannot run a kingdom. Houses don't get built by children, animals aren't tamed by children, food isn't produced by children. Not in amounts nor in time complex societies need to function. And yet there it was. Everything put in place, only to fall into an inevitable downward spiral of chaos in just a few months. When would the people of the land realize? When would they question why the caravans never reach their destination on time? Why the harvest won't be finished before the crops freeze? Would they simply accept that without learned people, sickness will burn through the population unchecked and unchallenged? How cruel it was, really. Made one question how something like that came to pass. Why did it all exist?\n\nWithout his captive, he never would have known. If it wasn't for them, he'd be hell bent on ruling over this world, a dream he was sure he's had since he was a child too. But really, was he ever a child? His memories, same as the bricks that made up his fortress, were created by someone else, implanted in his head to compel him to play his part. For this was nothing more than theater for one select individual, the accursed witch Stellior. She held all the strings. But not for long. He's finally got what he needed.\n\nThe thought made him chuckle to himself. \n\n\"Finally\" he said it out loud, amused.\n\nEven with knowing that the whole wide world was younger than a single day, his very speech reinforced that deception.\n\nSoon, he stood in front of the heavy wooden door leading to the tower cell. He raised his scaly hand open it, however something compelled him to stare at his palm instead. He could see the veins pulsating with blood under the pale, nigh transparent skin. Even for his own race, he was considered sickly all his life.\n\nAll his life? Another false memory. He didn't live that life. Nobody did. How ironic that this elusive world, the world that could have been formed in any shape the witch so desired, would be threatened by a shapeshifter.\n\nHe found himself smiling again. There were those that believed, with all of their hearts, that the evil warlock Ko'upe has set out to shroud the entire world in darkness. If only they knew that he was no longer driven by such a lowly goal! No! He will bring justice to this world. He'll tear this cruel joke, this mockery of free will apart, and win his own freedom. The witch would pay - wherever she was hiding - in due time. First, he needed to figure out his new toy, bend it to his will.\n\nWith renewed determination, he opened the door.\n\nYes, he will be free. Whatever it took.","Title":"A Game Gone Wrong","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Naser, Trish, Reed, Naomi, Rosa, Stella and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Examanon","Summary":"Da plot: Stella isekai's the gang into a fantasy story.

The savory smell of the salt water, the whistling winds flowing by everyone's ears, the cawing of the seagulls, and the perfect air brought him a wonderful feeling of content that he unfortunately hasn't felt in a while. With everything in mind though, he wouldn't trade this for the world. He had the girl, he had the ones who would always watch his back, and he had the bright future ahead of him now.\n\nEveryone's decked out in their own special outfits, too. Trish is in an all-black swimsuit with an eye-catching lei flourishing with a heavy variety of colors, Reed's in a simple white tank top with black swim trunks and shades glowing with a vaporwave-esque color palette, Fang's in a one-of-a-kind VVURM DRAMA top with fire in the background along with a swimsuit of her own underneath. Anon's in a jacket like Naser's with grey and red swim trunks.\n\nReed takes another inhale with his boof, smiling as he does so before glancing to Anon.\n\n\u201cHey, man\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here with us.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve changed us, man. What we have right now\u2026 it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been missing.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really have a sense of direction. We didn\u2019t know where to go.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026 did so much for us all. Our band is starting to thrive, our relationship is stronger than ever\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d\n\nReed slowly wraps his arms around Anon, letting out a stoned sigh as he does so. \n\nThis is nice\u2026.\n\nAnon happily wraps his arms around Reed, not bothered by the heavy smell of weed invading his nostrils. Trish notices this, and she can barely contain her excitement by the look on her face. Her tail is wagging incredibly fast, too.\n\nDoes she ship this or something?\n\n\u201cGuys\u2026\u201d\n\nAnon and Reed let each other go with a happy sigh as Anon continues.\n\n\u201cThis has truly been a wonderful adventure.

Now, I have a great future of me and the best group of friends that any person could ask for.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade you all for the world.\u201d\n\nA moment of happy silence follows. Everyone is touched by Anon\u2019s words, and it shows.\n\n\u201cStupid skinnie\u2026\u201d\n\nA curious Anon looks at Trish, waiting for her response.\n\n\u201cUgh\u2026 I can\u2019t believe I used to hate you.

Anon starts to feel witty as he responds himself.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, trigga? Couldn\u2019t get enough of me?\u201d\n\nShe quickly jabs Anon in the gut, forcing a laugh out of everyone.\n\n\u201cOW!\u201d\n\u201cYou deserve that, prick.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I probably did.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, can\u2019t believe I used to call you that\u2026\u201d\n\nAnon turns his head to Fang, with a true smile on his face.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even be here if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d\n\u201cI love you, Fang.\u201d\n\nAnon makes his way to Fang and embraces her with his head on her shoulder. Fang lets out a small chuckle as she practically cradles Anon with her arms and enveloping him with her wings.\n\n\u201cLove you too, dork\u2026\u201d\n\nThe feeling of Fang\u2019s embrace combined with the texture of the wings surrounding Anon makes the world around him melt into nothing. It was almost as if he had prematurely entered heaven. It was at this moment that Anon knew that everything would be okay.\n\nAnother long silence follows as everyone takes in the world around them. Nothing could possibly ruin what they had right in front of them. Time seems to slow down as senses enhance and envelop the moment. After what felt like a welcome eternity, Anon and Fang let go of their embrace as he speaks up once more.\n\n\u201cWith whatever I may be doing in the future, I don\u2019t want to do it without you all.\u201d\n\u201cI had been thinking about joining the Navy for a while, but it seems impossible because you wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, even now I\u2019m not sure on what I want to do.\u201d\n\nEveryone else seems to look at each other as if they have been given a cue. Reed bumps Anon with his elbow to grab his attention, and notions Trish to head to the car.\n\n\u201cTrouble with career ideas, bro? You don\u2019t need to stress on it, man.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought about a few ideas.\u201d\n\nA nudging from behind steals Anon\u2019s attention from Reed. He looks to see Trish holding a-\n\nGuitar case?!\n\nTrish doesn\u2019t get the chance to talk before Anon grabs the case and quickly unlocks the hatches. He opens it up to reveal a stunning, brand new red electric guitar. Etched onto it was the VVURM DRAMA logo along with everyone\u2019s names written and faces doodled. This wasn\u2019t just some thrift-shop instrument, it was a brand new design with serious work put into it.\n\nAnon could only stare as Trish chuckles happily, finally getting to speak.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 we know that you\u2019ve been having some trouble looking for something to do when you get out of high school and all that\u2026\u201d\n\nAnon digs through the case more to find a VVURM DRAMA hoodie similar to Fang\u2019s top, also made just for him. A look in the compartment shows a heart-shaped pick with \u201cA+F\u201d scratched onto it. It looks to have been made by Fang herself. He continues to examine everything from the case, barely able to contain his racing thoughts. Out of every possible event that could have happened, this probably was the least expected. Trish lets out another chuckle at his reaction.\n\n\u201cHehe\u2026 and we were thinking of some solutions for you, and after some real careful consideration, we all wanted to ask you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnon, would you like to join our band?\"","Title":"A Look Beyond The Shore","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"A Thrilling Camping Trip.txt":{"path":["Multiple","A Thrilling Camping Trip.txt"],"text":"Title: A Thrilling Camping Trip\nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Fang, Naser, Trish, Reed, Naomi, Stella, Rosa and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Examanon\n\n\nThe car, usually spacious, felt suffocating to Anon. It was packed with the most colorful bunch of individuals, yapping on about a variety of topics, none that he cared about. Surely, he would have jumped out of the car already if it wasn't for the deadly impenetrable forest around them. That, and the dino holding his hand with vigor. Her patience must have been nearing its end too. It made him wonder how the two of them could end up in this situation.\nIt all began a few days before. Could have been just the averagest of average days, but fate had other plans from them. If not fate, a certain pink marmelade menace definitely did. She approached the duo in the cafeteria before they could have retreated to the music room, cornering them with a tired Naser in tow.\n\"Camping! Doesn't it sound great? I know that it's going to be just great!\" Naomi exclaimed for all to hear \"It's a well maintanined national park, so we're sure to have a nice time! Plus half of the school will be there! Isn't that exciting?\"\nExciting wasn't really the word Anon would have used, though in this situation he rather opted to remain silent. He was sure that Fang will make her discontent known in just a second. To his surprise, she stayed more or less calm. Intrigued, in fact.\n\"Which park?\" Fang asked.\n\"Volcaderan Valleys! Ooooh, I can't wait to get going!\"\nNaomi was just as energetic as ever. This time even Naser seemed to be apprehensive of this.\n\"Calm down, would you? The trip isn't for another week. There's a lot of paperwork we have to do, and besides, I think that--\"\n\"Wait, the one by the volcano?\" Fang interrupted, her tone was that one of disbelief.\n\"Yep, isn't that great? The most memorable landmark for a thousand miles, and we live right next to it!\"\nThat actually piqued Anon's interest as well. He knew about the mountains nearby, but never really made the connection to the name `Volcadera Bluffs`. There was a legit volcano? Must be dormant.\n\"Like the dinorat's domain? Seriously?\"\nThis time it was a nearby standing Stella who interjected. Under normal circumstances, it would have been rude to just barge into a conversation like that, although it wasn't like Naomi and Fang were having a personal chat. About half the cafeteria must have heard them, whether they liked it or not.\n\"What's a dinorat?\" Anon asked, confused.\nHe imagined a furry bipedal raptor with a wormy tail, like that of a rat. Red eyes, mouth frothing with rabid desire to maim.\n\"Not what, who.\" Fang explained \"He's like, the most badass serial killer in town.\"\n\"Was.\" Naomi swiftly corrected \"And that's only if you believe in urban legends. There is no evidence that he, or anyone for that matter, lived there. And certainly nobody did any of those awful things!\"\n\"No way! There are witnesses to back it up too!\" The lime stego protested \"He kidnapped and tortured a ton of people, and then sacrificed them to the volcano! And it was a she, not a he!\"\n\"Really? I've always heard that it was a guy.\" Fang asked, totally entrenched in the conversation.\nBefore Stella could have answered, Naomi saw it fit to cut their exchange short. Apparently, she considered the nuances of serial killings less important than a promotion for a school-wide field trip.\n\"There wasn't, and isn't any kind of killer there or in town. The student council takes these things seriously, and we have done our due research. So please, Stella, keep these superstitions to yourself! There is no need to be afraid!\"\nShe deliberately raised her voice for the last sentence, addressing everyone in the room. Anon just now noticed how many students were listening in on their conversation. At the exact moment, the bell rang. The little congregation parted ways there.\nFrom there on, Fang was adamant on going. Truth be told, Anon was on edge too. Not that the idea of a schooltrip was to his taste, but seeing Fang this excited made him excited in turn. Stella's words kept creeping into his mind every now and again as well.\nA serial killer sacrificing peope. He never really believed in all that occult mumbo-jumbo, but he considered it metal nonetheless. With a reputation like that, Anon could imagine the park being a hotspot for youngsters playing dares on eachother.\nAnd thus, the two of them made sure Naser would file the paperwork with their names plastered onto it, application deadline be cursed. They've also spent the entire week getting supplies. Fang seemed dead set on finding the killer. A killer. Someone.\nAnon was more concerned about actual wildlife and outdoors survival, finally making use of all the knowledge he gathered up from browsing endless nope threads. Sharp knife? Check. Lighter? Check. Compass? Check. Big ass backpack? Rope? MAP? Check, check, double check. Fang even managed to get her hands on a couple of old timey walkie-talkies from his dad. In the end, the only thing they were missing was a gun. It couldn't have hurt, but then again there deemed to be a lot of drunk teens. Maybe bringing a weapon wouldn't have been the best idea.\nIt was also a pleasant surprise to learn that only a handful of teachers would supervise them, and even then the chill ones. Certainly not Spears. In his words at the official announcement, he had complete faith in the capabilities of the student council. To Anon that pretty much translated to Spears not wanting to be around Naomi for an entire week.\nAnd thus, the small group of friends embarked on their journey. Anon and Fang, Trish who just couldn't stay put once she learned about Fang going, Reed who just kind of tagged along, Naser and Naomi as official staff, and finally Stella and a last-minute-invited Rosa.\n\n* * *\n\nAs such, the Arin's car was packed to the brim. Luckily the girls from the gardening club had their own method of transportation, but Trish and Reed didn't. At first it seemed they won't fit at all unless someone sits in somebody else's lap. Fang and Anon should have been to be the logical choice, but Fang wouldn't have that. No surprises there.\nThen it was Reed and Anon. In some unfathomable way Reed was cool with that. In the end though Trish volunteered to sit in Reed's lap. He was down with that also, making it obvious for everyone that he's actually somewhere far, far away from the physical realm. Naomi was displeased, but got overruled in a matter of seconds. They were late already, something that didn't really bode well for the actual organizers.\nThe day turned to afternoon, and then to evening by the time they got to the forest, still quite a ways from the actual park. The vegetation started getting increasingly dense, and the road more and more rough, which wasn't helping the case. Halfways there Naomi got a text from the teachers that they would head inside with the students, and that they'll set up the first campsite.\nNaomi's chipper mood deflated afterwards. More than that, everyone slumped into their seats in silence. Anon couldn't have been more glad for that. Trish's inane ramblings about how they should have been allowed to play a show each night just about drove him insane.\nThe only noteworthy thing to happen during the rest of the ride was their coming across a couple of police cars. They didn't have sirens on, just parked by the side of the road. One of them was empty, the other had a very bored officer reading a book by the wheel.\nIn absence of better entertainment, Anon started theorizing about a manhunt for the Dinorat. It would have been the biggest clich\u00e9, having a serial killer on the loose during a schooltrip. Still, he couldn't really explain what two cop cars would be doing out here this late. The reading guy looked to be bored out of his mind, so he must have been sitting there for a while.\nMaybe Fang or Naser would have some ideas, he thought. Afterall their father was the head of the police. Or a chief inspector. Someone high ranking. They've explained it to Anon once, but he forgot almost immediately and has been too scared to ask again.\n\"What do you think they were doing?\" He whispered to Fang.\n\"Huh, who?\"\n\"The cops.\"\n\"How should I know, dweeb?\"\nTo everyone's surprise, Naser spoke up - for the first time since they got going. Props to him, driving for this many hours without pause, save for toilet breaks of course.\n\"Dad's probably told them about the trip, so they're doing a sweep. Just to make sure, you know. Nobody wants to lose their kids in a landslide.\"\nHis tone was flat and serious, must have given it some thought. It didn't really sit well with Anon though.\n\"But like, this late? And wouldn't that be the park rangers' job?\"\n\"If you want something done well, you know?\"\nThat didn't really make any more sense. Maybe Naser just didn't want the girls to spook and he thought that something might be going on? A quick check on Naomi told Anon that might very well be the case. She looked just as concerned, but trying to hide it. Trish didn't seem to be picking up on it, and Reed was just blankly staring out of the window.\nSuddenly, Fang's hold tightened on Anon's hand. She, too, looked more serious now. She gave Anon a glance, implying that he should shut his face right about now.\nThat really fucking worried him. Both Naser and Fang seemed to have some idea about what was really going on, trying to be hush-hush in their own ways. It was weird to see them cooperate like that. As if the rest of the group were civilians of some sort. Civilians, that needed protection, apparently...\n\n* * *\n\nJust as the sun has begun nearing the horizon, the six of them finally made it to the visitor center. It was a long and flat wooden building, its side lined by parking spaces and picnic tables. A dozen or so students lingered around. They were probably late too, and have been waiting for Naser and Naomi to arrive and take them inside. What was weird, the students were huddled around one of the tables, the one closest to the floodlight. Normally they would have been spread out one by one or in groups of three at most, fiddling with their phones and whatnot. Then and there, they looked like a gaggle of scared geese. It was only then that Anon realized how much the huge pines towered over them.\nNaser mutely parked by the gates, then announced their arrival. Trish had since fallen asleep in Reed's lap, who seemed to be equally out of his mind despite his eyes being open. It occurred to Anon that their friend might have literally overdosed this time.\nThey got out of the car, Naser and Naomi immediately making their way to the group of other students. Both of them were trying to hide their worries and tiredness, probably for the best. A heated argument soon broke out. The only things Anon could make out while grabbing his stuff from the trunk were something about noises coming from the treeline, and that a couple of cops came by not long ago, and that these supposed cops were scared too.\nA few minutes later Naser gathered everyone up, climbing on a bench to give a short speech.\n\"All right people, calm down! The main group has already set up camp at the first checkpoint. I want to reach them before nightfall, so we're gonna sport a pretty good tempo. I want everyone to get a pair. You will be responsible for the other person. Take care that they don't fall or injure themselves, and that they do not lag behind! Nobody is to go off the path, not even to take a piss. Is that all clear?\"\nAs Naser went on about the rest of the rules and safety tips, Anon had to admire his spirit. Naser must have been half dead from such a long ride, and yet he was being an inspiring presence. A spectacle for the troops. Being an athlete can do that, probably. Still, there was something in his voice telling of his anxiety.\nIt was then that Anon decided enough was enough, pulling Fang aside.\n\"What's going on, for real? What's up with the police?\" He asked, muffling his voice best he could.\n\"Don't freak, okay?\" She took a look around, making sure that nobody was listening \"There are a couple of pedos on the loose, and they were last seen in the area.\"\nWell, that's a load off the mind, Anon thought. The premise of being sacrificed has just turned into the premise of being raped.\n\"Look,\" Fang continued \"it makes no sense for them to stay here cause there's no food and shit, right? And there is no way they would attack a group this large. The teachers have been told too.\"\nThere was undeniable logic in what she was saying, but Anon still wasn't convinced. It all sounded like some smoke and mirrors bullshit one would say to the press when interviewed about a case. Something wasn't right. Too many little details didn't add up.\n\"How come you know about it? You and Naser?\"\nShe took another look around. The others have already paired up in front of Naomi, who was reciting the rules over. Naser on the other hand was going straight for Anon and Fang.\n\"I'll tell you later, okay?\" She quickly added before addressing her brother \"Whatup retard, we goin' or what?\"\n\"Momentarily. Can I trust you as a rearguard?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nOnce again, their exchange weirded Anon out. The two siblings were normally at eachother's throats, so seeing them super serious and working together was, well, weird. Somehow Fang was okay with Naser taking charge of the situation too, which was so out of character for her that Anon started considering if all of this was just a dream.\nThey took their place at the end of the convoy, and the column headed into the park. Even though Naser wanted to get to the camp before it went dark, that was definitely not going to happen. Fortunately most of the students had flashlights, and Naomi could hand out a few to those who didn't. Still, being in a dark forest at night made the already stressful atmosphere much worse. Almost unbearable, in fact.\nPeople kept jumping at every noise coming from the trees, and looking behind their backs instead of paying attention to where they were going. Someone almost fell over a root because of that, and has been limping along since. Naser wasn't kidding about the speed either. It was nothing short of a forced march. Although thanks to that, only after an hour or so he announced that they should be getting there soon.\nAmazingly, being at the back didn't get to Anon as bad as he thought it would. Not until a shrill cry came from deep within the forest, echoing through the trees, stopping the group in their tracks. The teens looked between eachother, not yet sure if they were hallucinating.\n\"Did you hear that?\"\n\"Dude, I think I just heard the dinorat!\"\n\"What was that?\"\n\"Anyone heard that?\"\nAnd then came another. The scream lasted for a good ten seconds, eerily sounding like a woman being tortured to death. Just about everyone lost their shit at that point. The mighty Naser tried to salvage the situation, to little effect.\n\"It's probably just a mountain lion guys, they can sound like that. Let's continue!\"\nHe tried to feign calmness, but his cracking voice betrayed him. He must have known that he didn't convince a single soul cause he tried again, only to be interrupted by more screams. That exact moment, hell broke loose.\nPeople started running both towards the camp and back up the trail. Some of them dropped their backpacks in the process, freeing themselves of the burden. In all honesty, it took Anon all of his willpower not to join them. Caught up in the moment he could do little to help Fang, who was trying to stop the runners. At least Naser and Naomi managed to catch a teary-eyed shaking Trish, but that was all. Their group of twenty swiftly dwindled down to half.\nThose who remained showed varying degrees of pants-pissing fear and hopelessness. With the exclusion of Reed of course, who only then started to register that something weird happened. Naomi - still holding onto Trish - started calling someone on her phone, probably the teachers. Maybe the police. Fang was too busy yelling obscenities at the scenery.\nNaser seemed helpless, mirroring how Anon felt himself. His hands were shaking uncontrollably, more so than Trish. His heart was beating so hard and loud that he was sure it was going to lure in whoever or whatever was hunting them. He was honestly scared for his life.\nThe seconds passed by painfully slow. Everyone seemed to be anticipating something horrible happening, their flight or fight response completely shat down. The only two things to be heard were Fang's continuous swearing and Naomi's phone beeping. A few moments later someone picked up, and a panicked Naomi started shouting into the machine.\n\"COME AND GET US! THIS IS SO SHITTED UP!\"\nIt was the first instance of Anon hearing her curse. Not that it was a good one, but still.\n\"The trail! We're at... Naser! Naser where are we? Naseeerrr!\"\nNaomi was bordering on hysterical. Thankfully Naser had some semblance of self-composure, taking the phone from her hands.\n\"W-we're at, we're just before the last f-fork to the checkpoint. There's a mountain lion nearby, please hurry. We'll stay here.\"\n\"Stay here?!\" Fang shouted at him \"Like hell! If you think that I'll--\"\n\"Shut the fuck up Fang!\" Naser shouted right back before returning to the phone, explaining what happened.\nHis comeback came out so harsh that it really did shut Fang up. She was huffing and puffing, eyeing daggers at Naser. Ultimately though, she's accepted the situation. It was then that Anon found himself capable of moving again. The rest of the group too, as if some spell was lifted, started moving about. Some flat out fell on their asses, others started looking around nervously, hugging eachother and crying. Thankfully the screams never came back.\nThe teachers and some other staff members arrived relatively fast. From there on they've split into two groups. Naomi and a few others going to the campsite, while Naser and the rest of the teachers went to find the runners. As he mentioned, the path forked about half a mile before the camp, so they were looking towards a long night of searching. There was no debate about letting Fang join the rescue party, however much she wanted to. Anon was seriously relieved at that, feeling way out of his element.\n\n* * *\n\nThe campsite was a spacious clearing with about a hundred small tents and a gazebo in the middle, surrounded by a well-lit chainlink fence. It felt much, much safer than the path, enticing a relieved sigh from the arrivals. There was a huge fire roaring next to the gazebo, students gathered up around it. The recent antics probably woke them, and now they were waiting for their friends. A lot of them came running once they heard Naomi's voice. She was more or less back to her normal self, writing down the incident as them being idiots who got scared by the wildlife. Or so she tried to explain away, no doubt to keep the charade going.","Title":"A Thrilling Camping Trip","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Fang, Naser, Trish, Reed, Naomi, Stella, Rosa and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Examanon"},"A Valiant Sacrifice.txt":{"path":["Multiple","A Valiant Sacrifice.txt"],"text":"Title: A Valiant Sacrifice \nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Trish, Reed and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n>Another school-morning meeting up with Lucy and reed\n>Trish approaches\n>aw shit, here we go again\n>starts her usual spiel\n>hear some cracks and screams behind me\n>turn around to see what's wrong\n>see Principal Spear wrestle a student\n>oh shit, is that a gun?!\n>try to push the others behind you\n>gun goes off\n\n>Fang tries to comfort you while Reed is frantically hold your wound shut\n>Trish is in shock, can't move at all\n>You hear Spear bellow in the distance\n>Her face is getting blurrier, her voice quieter\n>please don't cry\n>\"Anon, please stay with me!

I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so upset, Anon.\u201d\n\nAnon and Naser push through the lunch line, several people shooting uncomfortable glances towards the track captain. Anon tries his best to grit his teeth, once again having to explain things to Naser.\n\n\u201cLook, Naser, just because a stereotype exists for a reason doesn\u2019t make it okay to say! You calling me a \u2018cave-dweller\u2019 just because my ancestors lived in a cave doesn\u2019t make it right, bro.\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh, I\u2019ll never understand you people.\u201d The one-winged racist grabs a tray for himself and Anon, slowly shuffling through the line of assembled student. \u201cFirst, we\u2019ve all got to sit through \u2018Skinne history month\u2019, then-\u201c\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s HUMAN history month, Naser.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever. Then, after you\u2019ve got a whole month for yourselves, you decide that we can\u2019t bring up the past anymore. I mean, what\u2019s up with that?\u201d Naser grabbed Anon a slice of pizza; actually, the last slice of pizza. He may be racist, but he looks out for his friends, at least.\n\n\u201cNaser, try to see it from my perspective. Would you want everyone going around spreading harmful stereotypes about you, no matter how innocent? Ignorance isn\u2019t an excuse for that kind of stuff, man.\u201d The two of them had reached the end of the lunch line, the unobservant staffer behind the register barely looking up from their magazine. \n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m not like, calling you a \u2018spear-chucker\u2019 or anything, it\u2019s just some banter man, lighten\u2019 up. Nah, I got this man.\u201d Naser handed the cashier a stack of bills, waving away Anon\u2019s attempt to pay for himself. Anon gripped the sides of his plastic lunch tray harder. Somehow, Naser\u2019s combination of seemingly casual racism was made all the worse by his insistent good deeds. Sure, Anon was thankful, but did Naser have to act like he did? \u201cBesides, it\u2019s a good thing! You people invented tools, brought us fire, loads of cool stuff!\u201d \n\nThe unlikely pair took a seat in the crowded lunchroom. Anon could only glare at Naser as he continued his diatribe around mouthfuls of his chicken parm. \u201cSo what if I bring up some of that stuff every once and a while? I don\u2019t mean anything of it!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it Naser, you not meaning anything doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t mean something to me!\u201d Anon gestured angrily at his companion with his pizza, flicking specks of grease across the table.\n\nSwallowing, Naser looked Anon straight in the eye. \u201cOkay, I didn\u2019t understand any of that stuff,\u201d he intoned, causing Anon to crash his head into the table in exasperation. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry if I offended you man, I\u2019ll like, buy you a Christmas present to make up for it, I promise.\u201d Naser reached over to give Anon what was probably meant to be a consoling pat on the shoulder. To Anon, it was just condescending. \n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t Naomi get on you for this, Naser? You\u2019d think she would want you to watch what you say.\u201d Anon settled back to his meal, attempting to discover the root of Naser\u2019s offensive sentiments.\n\n\u201cNah, she doesn\u2019t care. Fuck, she says wayyyy worse things when we\u2019re alone. Man, you should\u2019ve heard her this one time, Naser continued between bouts of laughter. \u201cShe said, \u2018if they\u2019re so smart, why didn\u2019t they evolve some thicker skin!\u201d Naser slapped the table, nearly doubling-over with laughter. \u201cEvolve! Skin! Classic\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, Naser, it doesn\u2019t make me feel good when you say those things! It really doesn\u2019t make me want to be your friend, either. Naser, Jesus man I\u2019m serious! I\u2019m being serious over here, and you\u2019re laughing!\u201d Naser\u2019s shoulders still quaked at his evolution joke, and no matter how hard he tried to somber up under Anon\u2019s angry glare, he couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. \n\n\u201cPfft hahahaha! Okay, okay, I\u2019m good, sorry Anon. Whew, just hits you sometimes, ya\u2019know?\u201d Naser finally calmed down, wiping a tear from his eye as he returned to his food. For a moment, the two of them ate in silence, each man intent on the food in front of them.\n\n\u201cDamn, this chicken is already cold.\u201d Naser gave his chicken parm another questing poke with his spork.\n\n\u201cServes you right, for what you said.\u201d Anon replied, tearing another bite of his pizza off.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Anon, you mind building me a fire to warm this up? I\u2019m kidding, I\u2019m kidding!\u201d Naser had to reach out to grab Anon\u2019s sleeve to prevent him from storming off, laughing all the while as he pulled his human friend back to the table. \u201cLook, no more human jokes, I promise, okay?\u201d Anon stood there, glowering back at Naser\u2019s innocent face for a moment before huffily sitting back down.\n\n\u201cFine. But no more human jokes, or cracks about fire, or tools, or any of that shit!\u201d Naser held up his hands, palms outward in the universal sign of surrender. Their truce was temporary, however, as Naser just couldn\u2019t help himself. \n\n\u201cSo, monkey jokes are still on?\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Anon slammed his hands on the table, sending their lunch trays bouncing as Naser erupted into laughter. \u201cGo ahead, make your funny little racist jokes. That\u2019s cool. You wanna know why, Naser?\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ve evolved past them?\u201d More laughter from the dino, more scowling from the human.\n\n\u201cBecause I have something you\u2019ll never have, something that your sister seems very interested in.\u201d Anon\u2019s emphasis on \u2018sister\u2019 made Naser shut up quickly. Leaning over the table, Anon got real close to his would-be-friend, letting the silence drag on for a moment. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. You wanna know what Fang likes about me?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy HOT. MONKEY. DICK! That\u2019s right, I\u2019ve been FUCKING your sister in a way you scalie SHITS could never do!\u201d Anon was shouting at this point, all eyes in the lunch room on him. \u201cYou wanna know what girls like, Naser? A nice smooth human cock! In fact, I\u2019m gonna go find Fang and FUCK her with it right now!\u201d With that, Anon stormed off from the table, kicking the lunchroom doors open with a clatter.\n\nNaser just sat there, silently matching the stares from the other students. One by one they turned back, eager to move on from the embarrassing scene. No one was close enough to hear Naser whisper, however.  \n\n\u201cAt last, the family bloodline is secured.\u201d","Title":"Anon And Naser - Casual Racism","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Naser and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Anon, Fang, Reed, Trish \u2013 Dinoland.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Anon, Fang, Reed, Trish \u2013 Dinoland.txt"],"text":"Title: Anon, Fang, Reed, Trish \u2013 Dinoland\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Trish, Reed and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nThe afternoon waned, the incessant ticking of the clock slowly driving me insane. I had brought them here for a reason, damnit! And now look at us: Anon and Reed are playing Xrox, totally absorbed in whatever shitty game they\u2019re playing now, Trish is too busy painting her nails to notice anything, and what am I doing? Sitting here on this shitty basement couch, subtly dropping hints that no one understands!\n\nHeaving another heavy sigh, I idly flip through the pages I have saved on my phone: Dinoland pricing, the best route to get there, cheap motels we could stay at. So much for my grand plan of inviting the gang over to hang out in my basement, just to make a dramatic announcement that this summer, we\u2019re finally taking that road trip we always wanted to take. At least, the road trip I always wanted to take\u2026\n\nGlancing over at Anon, I can\u2019t help but feel the familiar butterflies in my stomach once more. Somehow that stupid dweeb had captured my heart, and now every time I sneak a peak of him, it feels like\u2026 Well, like I\u2019m looking at the person I want to be with. God, why does he have to be so hot?!\n\n\u201cUghhh, you guys are so lame!\u201d My exaggerated groan and full-body flop onto the floor does little to distract Anon and Reed from the screen. Fuckin\u2019 boys. At least Trish glanced up from her nails, her face creasing in irritation. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we dooooooooo something? Instead of just sitting in the dark?\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u2019cool in here, Fang. Besides, man, this place is chill.\u201d Thank you Reed, for your input. We could leave you in the freezer at Dino-Moe\u2019s and you\u2019d be alright as long as you had your Xrox.\n\n\u201cYeah, Fang, it\u2019s too hot to do anything outside.\u201d Trish blew on her nails, now a brilliant share of golden yellow, complete with glitter. \u201cI guess we could go to the beach again, but, like, I JUST did my nails. See? Aren\u2019t they cute?!\u201d Trish holds her completed work out to me, smiling. I manage to bite off the growl rising in my throat and give her a non-committal noise instead. I know she didn\u2019t mean to on purpose, but sometimes the way Trish flaunted just how pretty she was made me fucking pissed.\n\n\u201cThanks a lot you fucks, real great help here. Anon, can you back me up, dweeb?\u201d He was my last desperate lifeline. If I could get him on board with the idea, the others would have no other choice but to tag along.\n\nAnon stayed silent for a moment, his lips moving slightly. We all waited, glancing at him, accustomed to the way that stupid dweeb always thought out his words before saying anything. Sometimes, when he mumbled, it was like a precursor to the real thing, a warm-up act of stupidity before the real dipshit band took the stage.\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose it wouldn\u2019t be too bad to get out there.\u201d The uncomfortable edge in his voice made me smile. Anon never took off his jacket, despite the fact that it was like, a million degrees outside right now. Summer was not kind to dweebs like him. \u201cSure, Fang, let\u2019s do something!\u201d\n\n\u201cYesssssssssss!\u201d I couldn\u2019t help myself from double-fist punching the sky, laughing as I nearly took out the stand lamp that sat next to the couch.\n\n\u201cDid you have something in mind, Fang?\u201d Reed manage to pull himself away from the screen at last, immediately searching for what he called his \u2018signature dish\u2019. We all know it\u2019s carfe, Reed.\n\n\u201cNo beach! And I ain\u2019t climbing the bluff again, not with these nails, nuh-uh.\u201d We get it Trish, your nails look great. Bitch.\n\nAnon crossed the room, sitting next to me on the floor. I quickly pulled my phone to my chest, hiding the screen from him. \u201cYeah Fang, what have you been planning?\u201d I could tell he suspected something, the way he was grinning. The butterflies in my stomach started to beat faster.\n\nDamnit Anon, you and your stupid grin!\n\n\u201cUmmm, well\u2026\u201d I could feel my face blushing under their stares. Suddenly, the idea of a day in Dinoland sounded kinda\u2019 lame, even to me. I mean, we just graduated high school! We should be out getting shit-faced on beer and shit, not going to an amusement park for little kids. I could feel myself start to spiral, palms sweaty as I hide my face. Would they even like the idea?  \n\n\u201cHey, babe, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Anon placed a comforting hand on my knee. \u201cWhatever you wanna do, I\u2019m down for it.\u201d This time, his smile was warm and reassuring, the same one that had comforted me through so much these past few months.\n\nDamnit Anon!\n\nTaking a deep breath, I pull my phone away from my chest, thumbing the password in. \u201cOkay, this is gonna sound totally lame, but, I was think we could, maybe, go to\u2026 Dinoland?\u201d The shocked expression on their faces made me stammer out my next bit like a frazzled little kid. \u201cI mean, ironically, right? Like, who would wanna go to such a lame place? Hahaha!\u201d \n\nReed stroked his chin, his eyes already matching the color of his skin. \u201cIt could be kinda\u2019 fun to sneak into one of those mascot costumes.\u201d \n\nTrish blew an errant strand of curls out of her face, clearly nonplussed at my idea. \u201cYeah, maybe if we go just to see how lame it is.\u201d \n\nAnon just smiled, reaching out for my hand. For a second we just sat there, holding each other, before he chimed in. \u201cI think that\u2019s a great idea, Fang. An ironic Dinoland road trip!\u201d \n\nI gave Anon a smile, feeling my face begin to redden again. I knew he knew that I didn\u2019t want to go there ironically at all, but I didn\u2019t care. All that mattered to me is that we were going together.

And he needed to find something to him calm down. Now this had not been his first choice, but as he pulled the Nascar up to Reed\u2019s van Naser knew he would need this for the coming days. Getting out of his car, Naser strolled up and knocked on the van\u2019s side shakily. The large door slid open and a pink raptor peeked his head out. \u201cYo Naser! You accepted my invite. Nice.\u201d Reed said waving Naser inside. Naser climbed on in and crouched to the side of Reed who closed the door and turned to him. \n\n     \u201cLook bro I know how hard it\u2019s been for ya, so I\u2019m glad you came to have a nice few puffs with me. It\u2019ll calm ya right down bro, no long-term addiction guaranteed. And if you need to offload some shit on a bro I\u2019ll be right here. Taking a trip with ya.\u201d \n\n      Naser was still hesitant. He told himself this was a one-time thing and he would never sink this low again. If anything, the thought of his father\u2019s retribution held him to that. They both took a seat at the back of the van. Reed wasted no time in taking out a bong, bringing his lighter up under it, and inhaling the first vapes. Then he lazily passed it to Naser who hesitated a few seconds before remembering all he had been through with handling Naomi and his sister the last few years and he finally took the boof. Inhaling it like the newbie he was and coughing hard until he learned to pace himself.\n\n      The world became blurry and Naser gave a droopy smile. He now understood that Reed was living the good life. No nagging control freak of a girlfriend, never letting him do anything she didn\u2019t expressively approve of. Even after high school she controlled everything down to their sex life, not letting him have release until she felt it was right! What a bitch! In Naser\u2019s now drug addled state his mind was free from his usual inhibitions and a need to release all his stress would no longer be stopped by a now nonexistent self-control.     \n \n     Naser slowly unbuckled his pants and dragged them and his undergarments down to his knees with his thumbs. Letting his gene inherited thick, spear like, black shaft, grow to full erection. Reed, who was on cloud nine, registered the phallic sight in blurry detail. Quickly snapping him back to earth as Naser began working his hands up and down his dino pecker, drool running down from the bottom of the man\u2019s beak. Reed now understood that this was a far more serious bro problem than he had first suspected. A full five alarm emergency of a bro in need! \n\n       Sliding around to Naser\u2019s front view, Reed looked him dead in the eyes and asked \u201cDude. Mind if a bro helped you out?\u201d Naser\u2019s face seemed to return to lucidity for a quick moment and his face reddened. Though after moment\u2019s contemplation, he sheepishly nodded. Reed\u2019s caring eyes drifted down to Naser\u2019s throbbing member. \u201cYea don\u2019t you worry bro I\u2019ll take that pent up stress for ya.\u201d After uttering those final words Reed kneeled down and gently slid his body back to the point that his snout was at Naser\u2019s groin and his upper body in-between his legs. \n\n       Reed took things calmly, wrapping his arms around Naser\u2019s thighs and planting his hands on each of his buttocks. Finally, Reed opened his mouth and lowered it around Naser\u2019s impressive member. His tongue started off pressing down on the top of the now sweaty saft and then easing down the side before circling the entire dick. Swiftly Slickening the dick in its repetitive course while Reed\u2019s jaws closed slowly and he began to bob his head up and down. Getting closer to the base of Naser\u2019s dick each time. A passionate sound erupted from Naser\u2019s mouth, A low deep moaning that ended in a sigh. Tears building from the edges of his eyes. \n\n       Reed dutifully went on for a few more minutes like this. And though some precum was tasted, Reed could not bring Naser to his climax. The man must have been hard trained by Naomi; Reed concluded. Something more had to be done. Lifting up his head, Reed stood up and turned. Naser looked at Reed pleadingly, worried that he had stopped. Though his eyes went wide when he saw Reed bend over and slip his pants down over his tail and then dropped them to the floor entirely. The pink raptor twink then sensually raised his tail high. Showing his shapely, soft, though still form keeping ass. Reed\u2019s head looked back over his shoulder and his jaws parted to let out a ring of smoke. Which Naser saw as a heart in his inebriated state. \n\n         Naser was now sweating bullets and tore off his jacket in a vain attempt to cool down. As he did this, Reed lowered himself quite carefully down onto Naser\u2019s rock hard shaft. Reed\u2019s ass cheeks hugged his pole comfortably on its trip to Reed\u2019s exit. Given how wet the shaft now was it was a tight but quick pop of an insertion. Not wanting to treat Naser the same as Naomi had. Reed began to quickly pump up and down on Naser\u2019s bone. Soft ass slapped against Naser\u2019s groin as Reed\u2019s long, fluffy tail swayed up and down in sync with the bouncing.\n\n       \u201cReed\u2026. I\u201d Naser said in-between huffs and puffs. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2019 sweat it bro, just giving you what you need\u201d Reed said through strained grunts. Reed felt a powerful tensing in the shaft that was now deep inside him and brought his ass down fully one final time. Naser let out a strong gasp as a wave of pure bliss and heat smothered him and he at last came hard. Load after load shot deep into Reed quivering ass, seemingly never ending. Causing his tail to curl up around Naser\u2019s body. The cum entering Reed felt thick and hot, but cooling fast. The two bros sat connected like so for a time. Riding both the afterglow of the intercourse and the drugs. \n\n        At last Reed found the strength to dislodge himself from Naser and stood up. And Naser pulled his pants back up after cleaning off any residual cum that hadn\u2019t stayed inside his bro. He then stood up, collected his jacket and opened up the Van door. Giving one look back at Reed, Naser tried to get out a sentence. \u201cReed\u2026. look about this\u2026\u201d \n\n       \u201cDon\u2019t harp on it dude, A bro\u2019s gotta do what a bro\u2019s gotta do.\u201d Interrupted Reed, doing his classic Finger bang towards Naser. The shaken Naser gave a curt nod and let a little smile show as he walked back to his Nascar. Now knowing that drugs might not be his only new addiction to worry about.

He had mixed signals about that house. It contained the love of his life and potentially the end of his life, at the end of a golf club. At least he wouldn\u2019t be alone, because this was a sleepover! Childish sounding as it may be. It was also necessary. Recently a human gang war had broken out on skin row and Anon doubted the safety of his crappy apartment.\n\n    With him walked the pink smokestack known commonly as Reed. Apparently, his place had burned down due to no fault of his own, which Anon had serious doubts on. Both refuges carried only the essentials. Sleeping bags, PJs, and dental care. Though Anon suspected Reed had something extra in his backpack. A bold move considering Naser\u2019s dad resided at their destination. Hopefully they would not all die from Reed\u2019s mistakes.\n \n    Ten minutes later and the two were walking up to the front porch. Anon was going to let Reed knock but realized he had made an error as Reed just swayed in one spot, seemingly in another world. So, he stepped up and took the risk, tapping away on the door. A low groan emanated from a dazed Reed, causing Anon to look back as he continued to absent mindlessly knock. Right after he did the door opened and Anon failed to stop himself in time as his hand knocked onto a snoot. The one that belonged to Fang\u2019s dad. \n\n      Looking back with a face of pants shitting fear. Anon quickly retreated from the Angry Father. Fang\u2019s old man raised an accusatory finger at the boys. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my boy\u2019s generosity I\u2026.\u201d He was interrupted by his less murderous wife slipping in front of him. \u201cOh my! What fine young gentlemen, so kind of my Naser to invite you over this evening! Come in come in, I\u2019ve made snacks.\u201d With that she turned and dragged her husband inside with her. \n\n     Reed shrugged at the momentarily petrified Anon and went inside. Anon hesitantly following. There Anon saw Naser, Fang\u2019s mom, and Dad sitting in the living room. With Reed already moving to take a load off. Still feeling the need for self-preservation Anon sat in the chair with the most distance from Naser\u2019s Dad. Surprisingly Fang was not present. Anon made to quietly ask Naser, who was sitting nearby, but Naser knew that question was coming and whispered \u201cGirl problems\u201d And that was the end of that inquiry.\n\n       \u201cOkay boys it\u2019s already late so have your snacks, head up to Naser\u2019s room, and set up your shit there. And I\u2019m a light sleeper so no funny business!\u201d Said Naser\u2019s Dad, scanning the three for any signs of weakness. He seemed satisfied enough with the fearful looks he got. At least he thought that Reed was giving off that look, hard to tell. That boy wasn\u2019t right. He then got up and left the group to go polish his golf club collection. While Fang\u2019s mom said her good nights and went off to find a quit place to read.\n\n        This left the boys on their own as they finished the cookies Fang\u2019s mom had left out. \u201cSo, bro\u2019s I got this sweat new shit I\u2019ve been meaning to\u2026\u201d Reed started, reaching towards his bag. \u201cReed for the love of Raptor Jesus please.\u201d Naser implored. Anon went pale and started muttering things. Reed pulled his hands up and smiled. \u201cJust messing with ya bros. It\u2019s my Xrox in there.\u201d \n\n       \u201cReed I don\u2019t have a TV in my room.\u201d Naser replied. Reed looked disappointed but took a quick puff of something he took from his pocket and went back to a dazed state. Naser sighed and lead the two up to his room. His bedroom was just big enough for Reed and anon to roll out their sleeping bags a reasonable distance away from each other. Reed took the side closest to Naser\u2019s bed and Anon the side of the wall. After that they took turns heading off to the bathroom to get changed. Anon\u2019s PJs were plain green while Naser\u2019s was somehow the same pattern he had on his jacket. And Reeds was pink with a pattern of small joint smoking T-rex\u2019s covering the entirety of it. \n\n         Naser took a glance at Reed and seemed nervous, well a different kind of nervous. Though Anon was to socially inept to pick up on anything. \u201cYo bro you\u2019re looking stressed, if you need any help\u2026\u201d Reed began.\n       \u201cNo Reed I\u2019m fine, now we need to get some sleep. It\u2019s gonna be hard enough to achieve as soon as Fang starts going off on her guitar.\u201d Naser interrupted. Anon didn\u2019t feel the need to get involved. He had to get up early to run some errands anyway. Naser clicked the lights off and everyone got under their covers. Reed almost instantly started snoring so it took a bit for Anon to achieve slumber but the muffled sound of fangs guitar a few rooms down finally helped him sleep. \n\n       Only for him to wake up a few hours later into the night to see Naser tossing and turning in his bed. Clearly having a rough time of things. Reed was up to, and slowly crawling up the side of the bed! Anon\u2019s eyes went wide, followed by him quietly muttering to himself and seemingly coming to a decision to remain silent, closing his eyes only halfway. Reed continued his climb until his body was held up by his arms directly over Naser\u2019s own. Naser stopped turning and laid straight, his eyes snapping open. Amazingly, he didn\u2019t immediately scream in horror and thrash around. Instead, he sighed and looked into Reeds now gentle eyes and spoke. \u201cReed\u2026 we can\u2019t do this again and not with Anon right over there.\u201d\n\n       \u201cBro you need this tonight. A bro can tell.\u201d Reed said, looking down at Naser\u2019s groin where a stiff tent had been pitched. \u201cDammit fine\u2026bro but you got to start helping me with my stress in more discreet places then my house.\u201d Naser relented. Reed nodded apologetically and backed on down to his bro\u2019s crotch. Where he slowly pulled down Naser\u2019s pants, letting his long rod spring out. He then reached into his bag beside the bed and brought out a bottle of lube. Covering his hands in the stuff before setting to work methodically pumping Naser\u2019s member. Naser let out a few sporadic gasps and groans. Bringing a wry smile to Reed\u2019s face. \n\n     \u201cTime to be a real bro.\u201d Reed said sensually. Now that Naser\u2019s dick was lubed as can be, Reed took things further. Pulling his owns jams down and swaying his tail hypnotically. He put his arms around behind Naser\u2019s shoulders and used them as grips as he positioned his smooth, light pink, rear over Naser\u2019s crotch before lowering himself down. Naser\u2019s face was a mix of embarrassed and aroused as he looked into Reed\u2019s face. Reed returned the look with a droozy smile and rapidly bouncing eyebrows. The rut started out with Reed doing most of the work, coming up and down on his bro\u2019s dick as pre started to dribble from the tip of his own.\n\n      Then something awakened in Naser, an expression conveying intense lust overcame his face and his hips started bucking. Thrusting hard like a jack hammer into Reed. It was now Reed\u2019s turned to gasp and let out a shaky moan. Intense muttering was faintly heard from the corner of the room before a new weight was felt on the bed and hands reached around either side of Reed and grabbed his dick. \u201cYou need a bro for yourself Reed.\u201d He heard Anon say while the human\u2019s hands started jerking him off. \n\n      It did not take long at this pace for Reed and Naser to reach their climaxes. Reed came first. He groaned deeply as his load shot forwards into Naser\u2019s face. Naser tried to close his mouth but a little of Reed\u2019s seed got in first before he swallowed and came. Pumping Reed full of pent up spooge. Reed\u2019s ass cheeks clenched and he happily took all of his bro\u2019s burden. Everyone clenched their respective cheeks harder when the light to Naser\u2019s room turned on. The trio\u2019s heads swiveled around to see Fang\u2019s Dad standing in the doorway. The big man had a thousand-yard stare in his eyes and he took one long chug of his beer can, staring Naser in the eyes for a moment before flicking the light off and slamming the door shut in front of him. \n\n        Everyone\u2019s face was beet red and they slowly dislodged from each other. Doing a quick clean up in silence and going back to bed. There was no more movement from Naser. The next morning Reed was already gone before Anon woke up. Naser only gave him a look as if to convey the importance of never saying what had happened here. Anon concluded that he and Reed would no longer be sleeping in Naser\u2019s room and made quick work of gathering his things. On his way out he had one more encounter with Fang\u2019s father. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t have to worry about you and Fang after all. But stay away from Naser or this Club will be going up your ass no lube!\u201d He yelled as Anon bolted out the door. A confused Fang looking out the window of her room at her escaping boyfriend.

I'm starting to think Fang wasn't joking when she said I needed to butter him up with a couple of cheap romance novels if I wanted to get anywhere. My fruitless attempts of bargaining with Carl already eating up several precious minutes that could be spent hanging with my ptero girlfriend. I pick up the pace and head straight for the cafeteria. As I open the cafeteria doors I'm greeted by a veritable cacophony of sounds and smells. Luckily finding where Fang and company are sitting isn't hard. The monochromatic ptero acts like a beacon in a sea of clown vomit. The Fang gang are busy eating their lunch as I approach their table. I put my backpack on the table and take a seat next to Fang. As I rummage between school supplies for the food I packed away at home, the others notice my presence. Fang is the first to speak up.\n\"So, how did it go?\"\n\"I got nowhere, it was like talking to a brick wall.\"\n\"You went empty-handed, didn't you?\"\n\"I still think you're fucking with me.\"\nReed finishes sipping with carfe concoction and chimes in.\n\"Nah bro, the Carlmeister doesn't do anything for nothing. Everyone knows that\"\nThe pink raptor pulls out his phone and begins entering his comically long password.\n\"Don't worry, I'll hook you up with a link to the spreadsheet of what students have already gotten him. It's what friends are for.\"\nTrish looks up from her meal, the purple triggers face is unusually pale.\n\"The last thing you want to do is waste money on something Carldelewski already has. Believe me, it doesn't end well.\"\n\nI honestly couldn't believe what I was hearing. But if spending a couple of bucks on some trashy romance novels will help me bump up my grades, I might as well try. Finally finding my meager lunch, I place a couple of small sandwiches and a can on the table. Before I can even begin with final assembly, Fang has already snatched the can out from under my nose. \n\"What the hell is this Anon, are you honestly gonna put whipped cream on your sandwich? Is this some weird human thing I should know about?\"\nI try to respond, but with Fang giving me a particularly sultry look while shaking the can, my mouth refuses to cooperate. Instead, I'm struggling to not think about licking whipped cream off of Fangs' tummy. I manage to resist the urge, but just barely. I mentally become present just in time to see Fang press down on the plastic, spraying the contents of the can into her mouth. It takes less than a second, but her smug expression is replaced with that of shock. Unfortunately, Fang was so convinced there was whipped cream in the can, that her mind had already queued up swallowing. Shock gives way to regret, Fangs' amber eyes mist over with tears as her brain begins processing the foulness her taste buds are experiencing. She slams down the can and begins coughing and choking. \n\"What the fuck was that Anon!? I thought we said no more pranks!\"\nDesperate to get the taste out of her mouth she starts drinking anything she can get her hands on. Reed is still spaced out, unperturbed by Fangs' extreme reaction. Trish on the other hand is furious. \n\"What the fuck is wrong with you, you dumb ape? What's in that can?\"\nI know canned cheese is an acquired taste reserved for poor schmucks like me, but still, it can't be that bad. \n\"It's just cheez whiz, I don't know what the big deal is.\"\nThe purple triceratops suspiciously eyes the can before picking it up\n\"Let me give it a try. Maybe it's just horrible for omnivores\"\nTrish sprays a tiny amount of the canned cheese onto her finger and puts it into her mouth. Reacting even faster than Fang, Trish instantly has both hands over her mouth and starts running towards the nearest restroom. \n\nFang has somewhat recovered from what is apparently dino repellent and starts staring angrily at the overturned can on the table.\n\"That shit is evil. Whoever made it should be executed for crimes against all life.\"\nReed snaps out from whatever daydream he was having and picks up the can.\n\"Can I try bro?\"\n\"Sure, just don't blame me if it makes you sick.\"\nThe stoner sticks out his tongue and sprays a little bit of the contents of the can onto it. This time there is no retching, coughing, or barely restrained puking. Instead, Reed opens his mouth and empties the entire can into it. He chomps down, a look of pure delight on his face. Fang looks at the bands' drummer in horror, unable to understand why anyone would willingly eat so much of that horrible goop. \n\"Heh, sorry man, guess I got a bit carried away. That's some good shit though. Got any more?\"\n\"No,\" I sigh, \"Glad at least someone liked it though.\"\nWe finish lunch period in relative silence. Fang is still traumatized, small whimpers escaping her snoot every so often as she relives the ordeal. Reed went back to daydreaming, although with a slight smile this time. I do my best to cope with my dry lunch, sipping water between every bite to help it go down. Trish never returned, so Fang picks up her bag as we go to our separate classes.\n\nThe last period ends and students begin pouring out of the building. As I go down the long stairs of the main entrance, I spot all three members of Vvurm Drama chatting near the sidewalk. The girls are busy talking about some girly stuff, but Fang does brush me with one of her wings to acknowledge my presence. Reed on the other hand can't wait to talk to me. \n\"Anon, I've been thinking about that canned cheese all day. Think you can hook a brother up?\"\n\"Can't you just go and buy it yourself? It's just sprayed cheese.\"\n\"Come on man, don't be like that. I'll make it worth your while.\"\nReed opens up his wallet and pulls out a 50 dollar bill. He quickly shoves it into my hands like we're doing something illegal. \n\"I'll be expecting you to deliver tomorrow.\"\nWithout waiting for my reply Reed just gives the rest of the gang a wave and heads to his car. I do the same and head for the bus stop. Reed's a weird dude, but if getting him a couple of cans of cheez whiz will make him happy, then I don't see why not. \n\nThe next day I don't even bother talking to Mr. Carldelewski. I'm still waiting for the books I ordered online to arrive before I try my luck again. Fang texted me to not bother looking for the band in the cafeteria and instead come to the auditorium. Thank god, I'm already getting some weird looks. My backpack is about to burst and the clinking of metal is not helping at all. The loud creak of the auditorium door signals my arrival and Fang waves me over the moment she sees me. I barely take my seat next to her when Reed rushes over.\n\"Did you get the goods?\"\nI open my backpack and start handing him several cans at a time. In the end, Reed is holding 13 cans of cheez whiz and looks like he just won the lottery.\n\"That's all they had in the store.\" I start taking out my wallet to give him back the change.\n\"Nah bro, the rest is for your troubles.\" He quickly stashes the cans in his backpack. All except for one, which he sprays on top of a cup filled with carfe. Fangs' shudders entire body shudders and she becomes somehow even paler. Trish on the other hand has to look away before her stomach can refund her lunch.\n \nI nudge Fang in the arm to get her attention. \n\"I got something for you too, a peace offering so we don't restart the prank war.\"\nI give her a small box, still warm to the touch. Fang is cautious at first until she picks up the smell of the contents inside the box. She then immediately tears apart the box and starts devouring the dino nuggets inside. \n\"Fine, peace,\" she gulps down another nugget, \"But only because your offering pleases me.\"\n\"But wait, there's more!\"\nI pull out another can, this one clearly labeled as whipped cream. Fang puts down her almost empty nugget box and takes the can. Not entirely convinced I'm not just pranking her again, she gives the can a quick shake before spraying it onto my nose. Satisfied that I'm not tricking her, she licks it off of my nose with her long tongue. I'm completely frozen in place, which only amuses the ptero even more. Trish can't take the lovey-dovey shit anymore and decides to make her annoyance known. \n\"Get a room you two!\"\nHer words snap me out of my mindlock.\n\"Quit whining, I got something for you too!\"\nI pull out the last foodstuff from my backpack which is now practically empty. I toss the head of lettuce towards Trish who just barely manages to catch it. \n\"You might want to wash it first.\" My advice goes unheeded and Trish begins munching on the salad leaves. At least it's organic. With both the bandmates busy eating, Fang leans towards me.\n\"You know Anon, it's not such a bad idea. My parents won't be home for a few hours after school.\" Her voice takes on a husky tone. \"Maybe I could give you another guitar lesson.\" Fang giggles when she sees my face turn bright red. She pulls me close to make sure only I can hear her next words.\n\"You might want to buy more whipped cream on the way though.\"","Title":"Culinary Enrichment","Status":"Completed","Characters":"Fang, Reed, Trish and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Author":"Anonymous","Summary":"Anon brings lunch to school, to the horror of most of his friends"},"Date Night Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Date Night Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: Date Night\nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Fang, Samantha, Ripley and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: Capri\n\n\nDate Night part 1\n\n\"I'm almost ready, so be here in about uh... half an hour.\"\n\"Alright, see ya then Sweet Tooth.\"\n\"Oh shut up you c-\" she trails off for a bit before the call ends.

If you need anything I'll be in the kitchen.\"\n\"Alright, thank you.\" I respond trying to hide my dejection.\nOh boy, here we go. You're a train operator now, on the flimsiest rails in the world. Time to do your best to avoid a train-wreck. You nervously make your way to the living room, where you find Ripley, sitting in his armchair, absent-mindedly flipping through channels, still in his police uniform. He turns his gaze to you, then gestures towards the couch. You follow his lead and sit down, desperately trying to appear as relaxed as possible.\n\"Hey, Anon\" he says in the same indecipherable tone he always uses. At this point you can't help but think he's using it only to fuck with you.\n\"Hello sir, how are you.\" you're sweating bullets already, and your voice almost cracked. This is terrible. You need to get out of here as fast as possible. Where's Fang? How much longer 'til she's done?\n\"How many times have I told you boy, you can call me Ripley\" he laughs as he shifts in his seat. \"I'm doing just fine, came from work about a half hour ago.\"\n\"Anything exciting?\" grasping at straws to keep that dreadful silence I know all too well from creeping in.\n\"Nothing much, just paperwork, although I suppose that's a good thing, eh\" he chuckles. \"Say, you're pretty well dressed, you guys going anywhere fancy?\" You're taken aback by the sudden compliment, although it's true that shirts aren't in your usual repertoire, and this IS the nicest pair of jeans you have.\n\"I don't know where we're going actually\" you answer after composing yourself. \"She usually tells me where we're supposed to be going beforehand, but this time she was very cryptic about it.\"\n\"Sounds like she's got a surprise cooking\" he states, very matter-of-factly, before turning his attention back to the TV.\nA few minutes pass in silence, as he goes from channel to channel, trying to find anything even half-interesting. Suddenly, his face contorts with an unreadable cocktail of emotions. Looking to see what's got him so agitated, you see a replay of yesterday's PDGA golf tournament final. \"Oh.\" the sound of realization escapes from your mouth before you can catch it, and Ripley looks at you quizzically. \" 'ave you watched the match yesterday?\". You have, along with the rest of the tournament. Being informed on your girlfriend's dad's favorite sport is important for your well-being; everybody knows that. More urgently, he seems to be expecting you to comment on the outcome of the game. Your next sentence could make or break you.\n\"Yeah I've seen it. Cynodont Woods really fucked up those last few shots huh.\"\n\"Right? Even you could've putted some of those! And he still won. Bah!\" he scoffs.\n\nauthor note: look up golf shitposting on \/sp\/\n\nA few more minutes pass, as Ripley comments on various plays in the match, as well as ranting about different aspects of golf in general. You struggle to catch all of it, but he seems to be enjoying himself, so the occasional nod and 'I see' is all you need to satisfy him. Soon enough you hear someone coming down the stairs, and into the living-room struts Fang. You look at her and your jaw immediately drops. All of this waiting was worth it, you think. She's wearing white shirt with a black vest on top, tucked into a mesmerizing pleated dress, which, combined with the distinctly elegant leather boots she's wearing, accentuate the curves of her legs. To top it all off she's wearing the pendant you gave her way back, which gives you a heart boner like you've never had before. You stare in disbelief, having been reminded just how lucky of a guy you really are.\n\"You gonna gawk all night or can we go?\" Fang chuckles as she drags you up from the couch and towards the door. As you get your bearings you see the patriarch adopt a stern look as he furrows his brow.\n\"I trust you know the drill already.\"\nYou don't hesitate to respond. \"Yessir. Home by 10pm, either she gets here safe and happy or I go home in a body bag.\". You quickly stand at attention and do a soldier's salute, which prompts Fang to roll her eyes, and her dad to smile.\n\"Hah! Atta boy! Have fun you two!\" he howls before turning back to the TV.\n\"Come on Sweet Tooth, let's go\". A flash of annoyance and embarrassment on Fangs face signal that I've hit my target yet again. It really never gets old.\n\"Pftt. Shut up.\" she exits the house through the door you've opened like the true gentleman you are, and you follow suit.

I'm slowly dragged into consciousness, grumbling in annoyance as I squirm away from the light, burying myself deeper into the covers. Alas, it seems there's no escape, every spot I find harshly illuminated within moments. I roll away from that accursed window, shuffling closer to that familiar weight on the other side of the bed. I can feel the gentle rise of her chest as I drape my arm around her, burying my face in the soft downy feathers of her wings. The soothing sound of her breathing and the chirping of the birds outside are all I need to doze off again, content to sleep the morning away. \nEventually Fang stirs slightly in my arms, the rhythm of her breaths hitching for a moment. Her legs stretch under the covers as she yawns, her snout snapping shut as she wiggles against me. With a deep contented sigh she leans back into my chest, taking my hand in hers and gently stroking my fingers.\n\n\"Mornin' dweeb...\" She sleepily yawns again, using her favorite little private pet-name.\n\n\"Mhrrgh...\" I grumble into her wings, her shoulders shaking as Fang chuckles. She continues stroking my hand, her tail squirming as it tries to happily wag beneath the covers. The two of us lay there, gently dozing on and off as the morning sun rises, filling the bedroom with golden light. Warm air blows in from the window, carrying the sound of the neighborhood slowly beginning to wake up. Somewhere in the distance a windchime blows in the breeze, a gentle melody of metallic tones just barely audible on the wind.\n\nThe cool evening air we enjoyed the night before is slowly pushed out by the bright morning sun, the room gradually growing warmer. Reluctantly, Fang and I separate, shrugging off the thickest of the covers as we gradually wake up. Fang takes the opportunity to roll over and face me, her sleepy amber eyes shining under her tangled bangs. She just smiles at me, no words necessary to convey the feeling of completeness she knows we both share right now. Unable to help myself, I lean over and plant a kiss on the top of her snout. Fang laughs and tries to squirm away from my affections, playfully planting a hand on my chest. \"Hey, c'mon. Let me shower first, I'm a mess.\"\n\n\"You're beautiful.\" I retort, tickling her sides as I pepper her face with kisses. Fang eventually pushes herself free, planting a retaliatory kiss on my forehead as we settle down. Our fingers interlock under the sheets as we stare into each other's eyes, unwilling to get up just quite yet. Fang snuggles back into her pillow, her eyelids drooping as she decides to catch just a bit more sleep. I stay with her, content to watch the slow rise and fall of her shoulders, memorizing the peaceful look on her face as she nods off. I pretend not to notice the soft footsteps on the carpet coming from the hallway, until a little weight jump onto the mattress behind me. Fang jolts awake as tiny hands are planted on my shoulder, rocking me back and worth from behind.\n\n\"Daaaaaaad, get up!\" A lovely little voice whines from behind me, my chest swelling every time I hear it.  A second pair of amber eyes looks down at me from above, her face silhouetted in a halo of shortly cropped silver hair. She pouts adorably, her indignant expression undercut somewhat by the fluffy pink pajamas she's wearing. She shakes my shoulder again, apparently not convinced I'm quite awake yet.\n\n\"C'mon Dad, it's ten in the morning! You promised to make pancakes today!\" She pleads, her argument infallible. With an exaggerated groan I roll over, planting my face down into the pillow as Fang laughs at me. Our daughter is undeterred, getting down on all fours to get close to my face. Little does she know, she's fallen right into my trap. My arm springs out like a snake, wrapping around her waist and pulling her close as she squeals in surprise. There's no escape for her as I mercilessly blow raspberries against her neck, her legs kicking against the covers as she laughs in delight. Just when she thinks I've relented, my fingers snake their way into her armpit, her laughter redoubling as I exploit her weakness. I easily hold her tight as she struggles, letting her almost worm free just to pull her back into my grasp. Eventually I let her squirm free, her giggling like music to my ears as she calms down.\n\n\"Dad, c'mon! It's pancake time!\" She repeats, trying to pull the pillow out from under my head. I playfully stay rooted, another pair of hands pushing against my back as Fang betrays me. \n\n\"C'mon 'Dad', get going. I'm hungry too.\" Fang snickers, our daughter pulling against my arm with all her might. With a great exaggerated groan I rise up, wiping the crust from my eyes as the light of my life excitedly scrambles off the mattress. I grab my sweatpants from the floor and pull them on as she waits impatiently by the door, clutching her favorite stuffed orca as she bounces from foot to foot.\n\n\"Alright sweet-pea, I'm coming.\" I yawn, following her as she rushes toward the kitchen. We pass several framed photos in the hall, all showing treasured memories of the past few years. The reunion at Volcano High, the wedding, Fang smiling against the sunset, and finally the daughter we made together, swaddled in her mother's arms. \"Do you want to help me make them?\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" She beams, giving me the same enthusiastic answer as ever, \"With chocolate chips!\" Looking down at her, I know that everything was worth it, that everything is going to be alright. No matter what happens, I will never regret the path I took to get here.\n\n\"Well of course.\" I smile, all my worries long since forgotten as I watch her run, \"You can't have pancakes without chocolate chips.\"","Title":"Early Morning Shenanigans","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Amber and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Ending 3 - Ghosts of the Past.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Ending 3 - Ghosts of the Past.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending 3 - Ghosts of the Past\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Ripley, Samantha and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Grenadieranon\nSummary: After learning valuable lessons of support, and marrying a woman that relies on it, what happens when these lessons aren't obeyed as you fall into the same hole you try to dig someone else out of?\n\n\n============================================================\n\nI woke up, the room still dark with the sun barely creeping over the horizon. The alarm clock read 4:55 am, about 2 hours before it would ring its piercing reminder to get up and start the day. I look to the side to see my wife still peacefully asleep and use that image to ground myself in the reality. The weird images that broke my sleep already having faded from my conscious mind, pushed back into the void of the subconscious.\n\nI get up, trying not to disturb Lucy's sleep as best as I can. No movement from her, even as the mattress shifts from my weight. Satisfied with my success, I get ready for my morning routine, changing out of my pajamas for sweatpants and a simple olive T-shirt and running shoes.\n\nI'm trying to keep the noise down as best as possible, grabbing my keys gently and stepping outside. The air outside is cool and soothing, a reason I enjoy morning jogs. I do a couple of stretches to prepare my body for the inevitable strain it is about to receive. 'Well, here goes.' as I break into a jog.\n\nThe buildings pass by one by one as I follow my usual route. No music to accompany me, just my thoughts, but the physical exercise usually distracted me from them, after a while at least. I needed to do something to pass the time or the thoughts would swell up and consume my entire attention.\n\nFor the past couple of weeks, I had been waking up early, sometimes in a sweat. I had my thoughts trailing off to questions that didn't make sense. Would she be alright? Would I be alright? What if something went wrong. What if I died, right now? Sometimes it was merely a tingling in the back of the mind, sometimes it was a drowning cacophony of noise that made me lose focus. And I don't know why as it made me feel anxious. I thought coming home from the war, reconnecting with my high school sweetheart and marrying her would be more straightforward. That it would simply be a net positive. And it was, for a time.\n\nAnd then the doubts started setting in.\n\nAt first, I didn't know what to do. I just laid there, trying desperately to go back to sleep, but I couldn't shake the weird feelings. It was a couple of days in when I decided to simply distract myself with either chores or exercise, but they only seem to delay them for a time. Sometimes it goes for days without bothering me, sometimes it's every day for a couple of days and then it's gone again.\n\nWhen I reconnected with Lucy, she told me she was still broken, how she had the urge to preen herself again and only didn't because of how much it would disappoint me and her brother. It was clear she was leaning on me for emotional support and no matter how many times I told her how impressed I was with her, holding out by herself, finding a job and all that, it never seemed enough. She was carrying her damage and her experiences in life led her to have a hole where her personhood should be. She never figured out who she was and was desperately trying to be something, someone, by trying new things or attaching herself to labels that come with expectations she could just slot in. Rocker, non-binary, wife... I remember how shocked I was she even gave up music to distance herself from all the pain her senior year caused her.\n\n'Pain that you started facilitating because you made her question herself.'\n\nOh, there it is again. The self-doubt I somehow caused this. No, Lucy was damaged before I met her and I only tried to make her realize she was putting up facades and attached herself to stereotypes to replace a lack of personhood. I engaged her as a person and acknowledged her skill and experience when everyone around her seemed to just take her for granted. She reconnected with her family after realizing her brother never resented her for what she did to his wing. It was a dumb accident by a dumb kid, and it didn't impair him, to the point Naser never even realized it may have been an issue. On top of that, she tried to be this edgy rocker with a troubled past, and actively antagonized her family for basically no reason, just to fit the stereotype. I made her realize this and reconcile with her past trauma, and her relationship with her family improved drastically.\n\n'But look at where it led her to be.'\n\nShut up, that's not my fault. It's not my fault she had a falling out with her best friend, who resented me for 'driving a wedge' between them or whatever that triceratops thought I was doing. I regret losing contact with her, to talk it out with Trish and maybe have her realize what she did was not helpful. Maybe she would have come around, she seemed to genuinely care but was simply misguided.\n\n'What if you had died in the war? Many times you came close, a cruel twist of fate, what would happen to her then?'\n\nMy pace slowed and I came to a stop. I looked to the sky and saw the last of the stars being washed out slowly by the advancing purple of the rising sun. The burning of the lungs and mild sting in my legs remind me I had been lost in thought again. It was a good pain, grounding me in the here and now. I run the same route every time and could probably do it blindfolded.\n\n'What if you ran in front of traffic one day?'\n\nIt helped to drown out the noise. I find myself in the park, a bench nearby serving as a welcome respite. Just a short break. No, need to keep going, not dwell on these thoughts, distract myself with the pain...\n\n'This is why she preens herself. Without you, she would...'\n\nOkay, stop! What the hell is going on with me? I have a loving wife, her parents are accepting of me, even her father. I remember how Ripley used to antagonize and scare me every time I met him. And now he treats me like a son. I remember how scared I was when I asked Lucy for her hand in marriage at how he would react. But it turned out to be no big deal! Everything is going great, everything will work out and I will help Lucy get over her issues, together, you'll see.\n\n'Can you?'\n\nFuck you!\nI grit my teeth and pick up the pace.\n\n=========================================================\n\nI step out of the shower and put on the bathrobe, faintly hearing the buzz of the alarm clock and a groan as it clicks off. The bathroom door opens and Lucy enters, rubbing one of her eyes.\n\"Morning, love. Sleep well?\" I say. She hums and plants a kiss on my cheek. \n\n\"Good morning, pleasant jog?\" she said, still half asleep.\n\n\"You could say that. As pleasant as physical exercise can be.\"\n\nI exit the bathroom, make my way into the kitchen and pour myself the coffee I had put on earlier. Lazy Saturday, so I just start preparing breakfast, some simple PBJ sandwiches. I set the table and wait for Lucy to join me, it doesn't take very long. She grabs her sandwiches with a word of thanks and starts devouring them, occasionally sipping from her coffee. I smile, the image still looks ridiculous, even after all this time.\n\n\"What are you smiling at, dweeb?\" she says, playfully annoyed.\n\"Can a man not smile at his beautiful wife?\" I contort my smile into a grin. \"Eating like a...\"\n\"You best not finish that sentence, if you know what's good for you.\" she playfully jabs me in the shoulder.\n\"Alright, alright.\" I say, rubbing my shoulder, \"Say, do you need me to pick something up before the family dinner?\"\n\nWe had a small family gathering planned later this afternoon, and Ripley made good on his threat to take me golfing in the meantime. The women would likely busy themselves making the actual food, Lucy and her mother were great cooks and allowed little to no input or disturbance when they practiced their craft. At first, I argued that Lucy didn't have to cook every meal for me, but always relented when she said it was something she enjoyed doing. I could hardly bring myself to take something she enjoyed away from her, she always looked so happy and content while working in the kitchen, better than the melancholic look she sometimes wore when she thought I wasn't looking.\n\nShe gulps down the last of her sandwiches, I repress the urge to grin again at the sight. \"No, I planned to do that myself.\" She plants a finger to her snout and puts her thumb underneath her chin. \"Enjoy yourself with dad.\"\n\nOur breakfast concluded, we make our way to the sofa and I turn on the TV. I ask if there is anything in particular she wants to watch but just shakes her head a little as we sit down and leans against me. I just turn to a channel that was running a nature documentary and put my arm around her shoulders.\n\nWe sit there in comfortable companionship, having small conversations about the events and information being shown by the program. Not even the doubts in my head could pierce this peaceful moment, and I try to pay little mind to them even when they happen. I haven't told Lucy that I was having these thoughts, so far they didn't seem very problematic, but I couldn't burden her with my problems. I was supposed to be the rock she leans against, heaping a load of nothing onto her would do no good. I remember one night I had a nightmare and told her about it. She was worried sick and couldn't go back to sleep after I told her the story of what probably led to it, choosing instead to comfort me. She is so fragile sometimes, I can't unload this heap of garbage onto her if it will only needlessly worry her. It's so insignificant in the face of her own struggles, anyway. But she seems to be having a good day today. \n\nAt least I tell myself that.\n\nPart of me knows that I shouldn't keep this from her, but 'Hey, there is this nagging voice in my head that tells me everything with us will go to shit.' doesn't exactly sound very confidence inspiring when the one you are telling this to almost relies on you being stable and there for her. It's probably just stress of the unfamiliar, I mean, I am barely in my 20-ies, already married and still in the military on a temporary enlistment. That's a lot of change and unfamiliar territory, probably normal to have some doubts about the future, yeah?\nYeah, perfectly normal. I can just deal with it in the meantime until it goes away and then everything will be alright.\n\nWe continue watching various programs for a while until it is finally time to get ready and leave. I take the time while Lucy takes a shower to wash the dishes, get dressed and wait for her to be done so I can say my goodbyes and leave. She embraces me in a hug, and I can feel her hands clasp to the back of my shirt like I would vanish if she let go.\n\"Stay safe out there...\" she whispers. I can feel the unease in her voice.\n\"Don't worry, I will.\" and she tightens the hug even more. I plant a kiss on her forehead and she reluctantly lets go of me. Part of me wants to stay just for her sake, but the other part tells me it will just make things worse. Her facade of happiness and confidence drops in moments like these, where she shows her vulnerability. The fire and independence she had when I met her all those years ago seem but a distant memory. But no matter how much I try to reinforce her accomplishments, she can't seem to see what I see in her.\n\nI go on foot, years of walking everywhere and marching drills preparing my caveman body with plenty of stamina. Besides, Lucy was going shopping, she needs the car. It takes a couple of hours to just walk to her parents' house anyway, but I still got plenty of time. I just soak in the scenery as I walk, the nice, sunny day and the salty breeze from the ocean. This is a very beautiful place if it wants to be. Much different from Rock Bottom, altho it does have its dark places. You don't want to be walking around Skin Row or little Troodon at night alone, that's for sure. At best you get scammed, at worst, stabbed.\n\nI make it to the Aaran residence in good time, 10 minutes to 12 o'clock, when I was supposed to be there. I knock, even if they gave me a spare key after I married their daughter, it's quite weird to just walk into someone else's home like that. To my surprise, Samantha opens the door.\n\"Oh hello, my dear. Come in.\" She steps aside and I close the door as I step in the very familiar living room. She offers me a seat and I gladly take it. \"I didn't see your car, did you come here on foot? Do you want anything to drink? Ripley should be done in the garage in a few minutes.\"\n\"Just a water, ma'am. Thank you.\"\n\"It's 'mom', Anon...\" she chuckles lightly as she disappears into the kitchen, reemerging soon after with a glass, bottle and coaster. \"I am not one of your army officers, but I do carry the same authority here.\" I try my best fake smile at this 'joke', but it quickly falters as she sits down across from me, the inevitable was about to happen.\n\n\"So, how's my baby girl doing? I thought you were going to come here together.\"\n\nOf course, she had every right to ask me about her daughter, but I don't feel like I should be the one talking about her like that. She's going to see her later anyway, surely she can ask her then.\n\n\"She's doing alright. We just need to do some groceries shopping and she wanted to handle that. She is likely going to come by afterward, while I'm out with Ripley.\" I pensively look at the glass in my hands. Yeah, she's fine, she's just groceries shopping, no big deal.\n\"She's doing so much better since you came back. Thank you.\"\n\"I hardly did anything ma...I mean 'mom'. In fact, sometimes I feel like I could be doing more.\"\n\"You are doing fine, Anon. You grew up into a fine young man. I'm sure you will be a great husband and father, you'll see.\" She has the same, sleepy, happy expression on her face she always wears. \"You DO plan on giving me grandkids, don't you?\"\n\n\"That's...I mean...Uhm...\" she stumped me. Anon.exe crashed. She never brought that up before, and Lucy and I hadn't talked about kids yet, really. Did she know something I didn't? No, she wouldn't have phrased it as a question if she did. Seeing me probably run a million miles per hour in my head to come up with a suitable response, Samantha interjects: \"Oh, don't worry. You are still young. But don't keep me waiting too long, you hear?\"\n\"Yes!\" came the almost robotic response. I sip my water anxiously waiting for the moment to end, as Samantha just smiles at me.\n\n\"Well, good thing that topic died.\" the deep, gruff voice rips the awkwardness apart. The imposing ptero-patriarch steps into the living room. I rise from my seat to shake his hand. He used to be taller than me, but I grew a couple of inches after Highschool, and the bulk I gained from PT in the Army helped as well. I always felt it was part of the reason he grew a bit warmer towards me, no longer the nerdy, weird lanklet, but a man who stared death in the face every day and came out the other end.\n\nHe grabs my hand firmly and shakes it. \"Anon. Good to see you. Ready to go?\"\n\"Of course, Sir.\"\nHe gives a deep, hearty laugh. \"No need to be so formal, boy. We are just going golfing here.\"\n\nI finish my water and Samantha gives me a hug. \"Have fun, boys. I'll make sure dinner is ready by the time you come back.\"\n\nRipley leads me to the car, already packed with golfing supplies. I get into the passenger seat and we set off. The short drive was fairly uneventful. Awkward silence, even. We arrive at the golf course and Ripley pops the trunk. Hefting a well-maintained, expensive-looking golf bag onto the parking lot. We sign in, and he gives me the tour of the place. Bathrooms, exits, some rules, where the golf-carts are, the whole deal.\n\nThe lessons go well. After getting the swing down somewhat I was actually able to hit the ball a few times, sending it careening into various pools of water, the occasional tree, and whatever else they had for obstacles on the course. Luckily, the course was somewhat empty, or I would have felt like a hazard to other golfers. \"Doing good, boy. Don't be discouraged, no master ever fell from the sky, you know. This takes practice and dedication.\" He swings his club and the ball flies true towards the hole. \"Just like marriage.\"\n\nThat reminds me of something. \"Actually, Ripley, I was meaning to ask you something.\"\n\"'this about my daughter?\" he turns to me with a slight scowl.\n\"No, not specifically...I was wondering. When you and Samantha got married, did you have...like...doubts?\"\n\"Doubts?\" I notice the grip on his golf club tightening. I fear I may have overstepped a boundary or pissed him off or something, but before I can back out and apologize, he continues: \"All the time boy. In the beginning, you don't know if everything will work out or if your job will hold. I was only a lowly street cop at the time I married Sam, although a damn good one, mind you. But did you have anything specific in mind?\"\n\"Well...\" I struggle with whether or not I should straight up tell him that I worry because of Lucy's mental problems. If I can help her with them or not. What I should do. But kicking down the door like that would probably not go over well. \"...just the future in general. I'm sure you heard Samantha mention 'kids' and all that. I'm also still on a temporary contract with the Army, and don't know what to do afterward.\"\n\"Well, I could see if I can pull some strings at the precinct, get you into the force. You want to do police work?\"\n\"That...thanks for the offer. I'll think about it.\"\n\"As for the kids. Boy, I'd be as happy as anybody to be graced with grandkids, but do not think you have any obligation.\" He looks me up and down. \"I'll be honest, I'm not even entirely sure that it works, what with you being Human and all. No offense.\"\n\"No, yeah, I don't really know either. Not really something they covered in biology class.\"\n\n'It's gonna be some freak of nature.'\n\nOh great, here we go again.\n\n'Maybe you're lucky and it's stillborn, saves you the trouble of having to raise a sick abomination.'\n\nI try to suppress the thoughts as we drive over to my golf ball, stranded in a sandy pit. Ripley gives me some advice on how best to get the ball unstuck. I take the club he recommends and step up to the ball, half-buried in the sand. The feeling of soft sand reminds me of the beach walks I take Lucy on sometimes, and I take my position to strike the ball.\n\n'Reminds you of the hellhole you got stuck in for years.'\n\nYou miss your strike, sending the ball and a large wave of sand flying up in front of you. The crack of the club hitting the ball and a gust of dust send you right back into a firefight in the desert, the heat hits you like opening an oven. Someone yells at you, but you can't make out the face. You are taking cover behind your vehicle's wheel, the rifle in your hand feels wrong. Everything feels wrong. This is a bad memory, but instincts drive you. You hear the snap of a bullet and another gust of sand shoots up a yard away from your feet. You peek around the side of your vehicle and press the rifle into your shoulder, click.\n\"Anon, look at me.\"\nA large hand grips your shoulder, turning you around. It is a large brown pterodactyl. Weird, you don't remember having one in your platoon. Maybe he's from some other unit?\n\"Anon, what's wrong?\"\n\nI snap back, Ripley standing in front of me, his large hand on my shoulder. \"I...what?\"\n\"You got all glassy-eyed after you hit the ball and just stood there, mumbling. Are you okay?\" the concern in his voice felt genuine. I look at my hands, then back to him.\n\"I think so. I don't know what just happened.\" Ripley hands me a bottle of water, my hands are shaking. I take a deep breath, calming myself, and open the cap.\n\"Does that happen often?\" he removes his hand from my shoulder and steps back, giving me some room.\n\"No. I don't think so...It's nothing, really. Just remembered something and got lost in my thoughts I guess.\" I empty the bottle halfway and dump the rest over my head. Still trying to get to grips with what just happened. This was definitely a first. Yes, I had some weird nightmares here and there but never during the day. It's been months since I've been here, been home, and never really thought about it. Ripley has an uncharacteristically soft expression on his face.\n\"Maybe you need to see someone about that.\" he cradles his chin. \"Or maybe a stiff drink?\"\n\"I think that would be nice.\" I actually welcome the change, drinking with Ripley, just hanging out. \"But I am not the sort to drown his problems in alcohol, it's also barely past 2 pm. But really, it's nothing to worry about.\"\n\"Hah. Maybe later then.\" his smile swiftly turns into his trademark scowl. \"I've seen that sort of stuff before, Boy. Don't take this lightly. If you want to talk about it, we can drop the golf and do it...and I'm serious here.\"\nHis sudden accusatory tone has me back down defensively, something about being confronted like that just doesn't feel comfortable. \"What, do you think I'm gonna snap from a bad memory? It's nothing I couldn't handle in person, my brain has no power over me.\" I wave him off dismissively. \"Let's get back to this golfing thing, as you said, it takes practice.\"\n\nThe rest of the course goes about as horrible for me as before. But I do admit, hitting something really hard with a club felt cathartic. Ripley kept an eye on me for a while, I could notice, but he relaxed, concentrating more on correcting my pose and swing. Inevitably, it was time to pack up and return home.\nThe drive back to the Aaran residence felt a bit more awkward, my weird episode having clearly caused some anxiety, both in me and Ripley. I am still trying to find out what the fuck that was. I used to meme about that shit in my youth, you know, the shell-shocked veteran having a flashback during new years. Raptor Jesus, I hope I am not losing my mind.\n\nWe arrive back at the house, noticing my car parked in front of the entrance. The smell of a freshly cooked meal is already noticeable even in the garage. \"I'll unpack later, let's not keep the ladies waiting.\" Ripley said. I grab his shoulder before he steps away, he looks back at me with a sideglance.\n\"Let's not mention 'that' to Lucy, okay? I don't want her to worry about it.\"\nRipley scoffs, \"Keeping secrets already?\"\n\"No, it's just...I'd rather not sour the mood during the dinner.\" I lie \"I know she will just worry about it. I'd rather tell her later.\"\n\"Fine, not my place anyway.\" I get the sense he's a little bit disappointed, but I really can't tell Lucy about any of this, at least for now.\n\nThe table is already set, and to my utter delight, I see Lucy next to Samantha plating some of the sides. Why do I even worry, she spend 3 years without me, she can take a couple of hours. However, the sight of her fills me with peace and contentedness. As does the smile she beams my way when she spots me out of the corner of her eye.\n\"We will be done in a minute, boys. Sit down.\"\nWe shuffle into our seats and shortly thereafter, the Ladies start plating the meal they prepared. A basted meatloaf, with carrots and peas in gravy. Fried potato slices round out the meal. It smells delicious as always, and soon plates are filled with a generous helping of food. Idle conversation is being had, and Ripley remarks that I've done fairly well on the green, for a rookie. He keeps shut about my little episode, but he does shoot me a glance every now and then, as I try to keep the conversation pleasant.\n\nThe dinner ends and we say our goodbyes. I shuffle into the driver's seat. An idea strikes my head, and as Lucy buckles into the seat next to me, I ask: \"Do you want to go on a walk?\", but for a brief moment her expression looks empty. Just looking ahead at nothing. She quickly puts on a smile and puts her hand on my thigh. \"No, I think I just want to stay home today, we got church tomorrow and I'm pretty beat from the groceries and cooking. But thanks for offering.\"\nI grab her hand in mine, lean in and we kiss. \"Fine then, just a lazy evening.\"\nTo my surprise, she shoots me a coy smile. \"Maybe not so lazy...after all.\", in the most sultry voice she can, half-opened eyes and grin forming indicating exactly what she means.\n\n==================================================================================\n\nThe next weekend came and went, and I've been covertly trying to find out what could be wrong with me. I called the army office to maybe talk to a psychiatrist, but they haven't come back to me with an appointment or really anything helpful. Doogle was no great help either, and I briefly contemplated posting about it on a magyarian basketweaving board to maybe get some advice, between the memes, shitposts and ridicule it will most likely attract. For as much shit as they get from the internet, there are some genuinely good people from all walks of life on that board. Maybe some of them have or are going through something similar to me.\nI, of course, have a sneaking suspicion it's Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, something that afflicts more veterans, but can also occur after accidents, or witnessing something horrific or traumatic. But I refuse to admit I have some schizo mental disorder before I got more proof. They would probably hook me up on some pills or lock me in an asylum, and I'd rather not do any of that. Being branded as a ticking time bomb is also something I'd rather avoid.\nBesides, nothing I saw in the war really phased me, just shoved away and forgotten about. If I was going to get a mental breakdown from it, I would have gotten it there, in the moment. Right?\n\nAs the days go by, I am hit by a particular bout of insomnia one night after Lucy broke down crying saying her feathers itched and how much it hurt to put on a brave face and ignore it. We cradled each other until she fell asleep, I hoped my words of comfort helped in any sort of way. But afterward, I just can't seem to fall asleep. After hours of trying fruitlessly, I decide to go tire myself out completely and go for a run. I heard insomnia can be caused by something unprocessed in the subconscious, but I'd rather not probe and stir the hornets' nest. As I am running, alone, the city bathed in the fluorescent LED light of the streetlamps, I am almost immediately assaulted by my brain.\n\n'We are just doing the same thing. Pain as a distraction'\n'Distract ourselves from the obvious trying to shove it away'\n'Our marriage will be childless and unfulfilled'\n'We can't fix her'\n'Can't even fix ourselves.'\n'Ripley was right, we are just lying to her'\n'Should really just talk with her but we are too much of a pussy to face the consequences!'\n'Think the army kooks are going to do anything useful?'\n\nI really should bring music with me next time. At least at this point, I had stopped bothering to argue with my thoughts like some crazy person.\n\nMy attention catches on a bar, some particularly grungy nu-metal blasting from it. Maybe I can drown some of the noise in there, wash up, get some water or something. Then I remember: I didn't bring my wallet. I almost resigned myself to keep running until I spot a sign outside. 'Special offer. Free drinks for Veterans, one per tour of duty!\" and a flag crudely drawn under it. \"Can just get a water or a beer, nothing to worry about.\"\n'How would they know we served, not like we carry your military ID'\n'They'd just kick us out for stolen valor or something'\nFuck it, doesn't hurt to ask.\n\nI enter the establishment simply called 'Jeff's foxhole', a gruff-looking raptor manning the bar. His many tattoos and some pictures around the bar make it abundantly clear he was in the Marines, the age of the man and the fade on the photos indicating it must have been decades ago. Not many patrons inside, middle of the week and all. I make my way over to the bar and the barkeeper glances over. \"What can I get ya?\" as I browse the selection of drinks on offer, I briefly consider a water, noticing it's free...\n'Ordering water at a bar, fucking pathetic'\n\"Whiskey. Straight, no ice.\"\nHe looks me up and down, I don't have service tats or anything, just scars on my arms and wearing an army shirt. \"How many?\" he asks, and I shoot him a puzzled look.\n\"How many tours did you have?\"\nDid he just assume I served because of how I look? \"Three, all back to back essentially.\"\n\"Ah, one of those. Don't worry about needing to show ID, ol' Jeff can tell a trooper from a fake a mile away.\" He puts the glass down in front of me, and I notice he didn't skimp on the contents.\n\"See that, those wear-lines on your shirt? Tells me you wore body armor over it for a long time. You are sweaty, probably running out in the middle of the night and left your wallet. The muscle and scars tell me you probably saw combat, or were particularly clumsy, and some of those look like shrapnel wounds. The ring on your finger tells me you are married. It's not my place to pry what brings you here, but I've been married three times, son.\" Great, being judged by some stranger already.\n'He's just being sympathetic because we deserve pity'\nI down half the glass in one go. \"It's not your place to pry. But thanks.\" There is however one question that lingers in my mind. \"What is the occasion for the free drinks anyway, it's not a holiday.\"\nThe raptor points to a purple heart in a casing on the wall. \"Had a bad day 26 years ago, got me out of the service on an injury. AP-Mine tore my shin clean off.\" pointing down at his leg with the other hand.\nI peek over the bar as he lifts his pant leg a little to show the crude prosthetic under it. \"Ever since I opened this bar, I run this as a little thank you to my boys.\"\nIt's been less than a year since I've been back, and I can't say I frequented this part of town or the bar scene very much before I left.\n\"Well, thanks anyway. I think I needed something to take the edge off tonight.\"\nI decided to engage with Jeff on our past, talk about the difference in branches and what time made of the service. He explains in detail the day he lost his leg, in between serving other patrons as they come. I relay a particularly nasty ambush we ran into one time. As I sip on the second glass and notice a slight buzz and some sleepiness kicking in. I check the time and notice I already spend almost an hour here. 'Fuck, I should get going' I think, as I finish my drink and excuse myself to the bathroom.\n\nMinutes later, I step out of the bar, raising a hand to the crowd, and the cool air embraces me. I probably shouldn't be running when I'm drunk, so I settle in for a cozy walk home. Great, more time for the bullshit to pester me, too.\n\nBut to my surprise, nothing. Not a single doubt came to my head. \nHuh, weird.\n\nEnjoying the peace and quiet for once, I eventually make my way home, trying to be as quiet as possible. I skip a full shower and just settle for rubbing myself down a bit with water and soap to keep the noise down, Lucy still being sound asleep. I creep into bed and lay my arm over her, careful not to squeeze her precious wings too much, and a peaceful sleep soon falls over me.\n\n==================================================================================\n\nSome weeks later, the Army finally got back to me, saying they have an appointment in 2 months. 'Good news, we have a spot to deal with your potential mental issues, please don't off yourself while you wait for it. Fucking typical. If they need something from you, they demand it in time, but if you want something from them...' \"True that!\", Jeff replies, and I curse my mumbling. I started frequenting the bar more often and took Ripley up on his drink offer one weekend too. He actually had some good news for me, that after I leave the army next year, I could be going into police training. Of course, I know that would probably need to be preempted by getting my problem under control, but I seem to have a handle on it now. It's not nearly as problematic as it used to be. There was the occasional flashback, some discarded trash by the side of a road. A sudden bang. But I learned to live with it. Telling whoever is around at the time that I'm just spacing out.\n\nI get up from the barstool and say it's time to head home, I almost lose my footing as the world refuses to stand still for me. Damn, probably had one too many. No matter, won't kill me. As expected, the walk home is blissfully quiet. No worries, no sorrows. Just get home and sleep. But my blissful daze is shattered the moment I step into my home. I hear sobbing from the bedroom. \"Lucy?\" I close the door and make my way towards it, I hear shuffling, and when I open the door, Lucy is in bed, just like I left her. \"Lucy, did you cry? What's wrong?\" I whisper, no reaction but when I step closer, I smell a distinct, irony smell. I pull the blanket up and sure enough, her wings are a mess, she's bleeding on the sheets. \"What the hell, Lucy! You promised me to not do that anymore!\". She clasps her hands over her face, trying to hide it, and immediately begins crying.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have. B-but I woke up, you weren't there. I...I...I don't know what I did wrong, Anon!\"\n\"What? What you did wrong? You did nothing wrong!\"\n\"Then w-why do you feel the need to leave and get drunk almost every other night?\" she's shooting a pleading look at me. \"You reek of booze, and...and...\"\n'I caused this'\n\n\"I...No. It's nothing you did.\" I sit down next to her and grasp her hands, somewhat awkwardly as my hand-eye coordination is still a bit off.\n'Congratulations, I made it fuckin worse.'\n\"But then why? I know I'm still broken, it's driving you away. And-and the thought of losing you again, it's...it's driving me nuts! I'm nothing but a burden...\"\n\"You are NOT a fucking burden!\" I grab her in a tight hug. \"Don't ever talk like that again!\"\n'I know she's right'\n'She's alot to deal with, sometimes'\n'Most of the time'\n'She's just putting on a front for the world'\n'She's absolutely...'\n\nI get up from the bed, hands grasping the sides of my head. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. Shutupshutupshutup, not now, not fucking now!\n\"Then what-\"\n'Can't even bear you a child.'\n'Can't leave her alone or she falls prone to self-harm'\n'She's dysfunctional without me'\n'She said it herself, she's fuckin broken'\n'And I can't fix her!'\nSHUT UP, SHUT UP, \"SHUT UP!\"\n\nThe look of sheer horror on Lucy's face tells me I've yelled that last part out loud. I'm also standing there with my hand raised, balled into a fist, like I'm about to fucking hit her. What am I doing? The realization makes me want to apologize, but the words aren't coming to me. She turns her gaze away and continues sobbing, blanketing herself in her feathers. I lower my arm towards her, taking a step forward.\n'Good job, I fucked it up'\n'Dumbass'\n'The fuck am I doing, apologize!'\n'Give her some room'\n\nI run out of the room, shocked and with a growing pit in my stomach. I've got to shut my brain off, or I have no chance in salvaging this situation. I grab a bottle from our liquor cabinet, uncap it, and down its contents. Maybe if I'm blasted enough I can form an apology. But as I'm drinking, I catch sight of a picture on the cabinet, our wedding picture. She looks so happy. So beautiful in that white dress. Her parents were so proud. But in the frame, I spot another image. Me, downing a bottle of booze after I just yelled at her for no reason. While she's in bed crying her heart out, thinking she did something wrong. After I kept slinking off to a bar without telling her where I went. The thought had me disgusted even more.\n\n'I've lost complete control of myself...'\n'She probably thinks I have an affair'\n'Well I do, with alcohol'\n'Trying to drink my problems away'\n'Numb the brain so the guilt doesn't consume you'\n'You survived the war, came back, gave her hope. She was doing fine without you, and now look at her.'\nI fall to my knees, crying. The sudden realization I am destroying her even more when I was supposed to be her support crushed me. Supposed to be her pillar. A pillar that is currently crumbling down. \n\n'I've made a complete mess of things.'\n'Go, get out, come back later when I am less of a fucking drunk'\n'Just sleep on the couch, fix this tomorrow'\nI grab my phone and keys. I don't even know what I'm doing. I just stumble away.\n'Pussy, can't even apologize to her.'\n'The fuck do I think of going?'\nMy phone buzzes several times. I ignore it.\nI just stumble around town, until I come upon a bridge. A bridge I am all too familiar with. I pass this every time on my runs since I came home, and irrational thoughts start filling my head even louder.\n\n'What, you thinking of jumping?'\n'Fucking loser'\n'Pussy wouldn't even have the balls'\n'Oh yeah, suicide will fix it, it always fixes everything, doesn't it'\nI run my hand along the railing until I arrive at the midpoint. Staring out into the skyline, I sit down on the curb. The sound of the traffic underneath was the only thing to break the silence.\n\n\"I should have asked for help, I can still turn this around. I can go back and apologize, I can tell her what my problem is. She'll understand. She always does.\"\n'and what if that is just part of her facade? Part of the scheme to keep her claws in you?'\n\"That's bullshit, she loves me. And I love her. She's just got problems. I know this, I know the Lucy she could be again.\"\n'But in all this time, did anything I did help?'\n\"Not....really...but I have to be her support...\"\n'And when I started having problems, did I go looking for support?'\n\"I don't need any, I can deal with this shit myself.\"\n'And what makes me so sure she can't deal with hers? She's done so while I was gone.'\n\"No...I...\"\n'She'd deal with the loss, she'd deal. She has her family.'\n\"I...\"\n'At this point, I'm just making shit worse. I have a decent life insurance policy. She can use the money and start over.'\n\"...\"\n'It's perfect, I am drunk, I fell over the railing. Perfect accident. Nobody would even question it.'\n\nI notice I am already standing on the railing, steadying myself on a lamppost. It does make sense. She'd get a huge payout, more than enough to pay off any debts, cover some expenses for a while. Find a nice, new husband who cares. Who isn't a useless drunk. Who doesn't have flashbacks and a need for numbing his fucking mind to deal with everyday problems. I watch the cars pass by underneath. Just one clumsy step, need to make this look like an accident. No. I can't do this to her too.\n\nI barely notice a car pulling up next to me. A familiar car. I don't even turn around when I address the large ptero, half slurring my words.\n\"How'd you find me here?\"\n\"Lucy called me. How else? She was crying...\" of course, my phone...probably located it or something. I have been here for a while, haven't I?\n\"Told me there was a fight, you were drunk and you stormed off. She was worried sick you might do something stupid.\"\n\"And you are here to stop me?\"\n\"Don't know. Were you about to do something stupid, boy?\"\n\nYes, yes I fucking was. She still cared. After everything I just did, she was still worried...about me...\n\n\"Step down from the rail, son, and let's talk. You need help.\"\n\nYes, I fucking do.\n\nI step down from the railing. My resolve shattered. I clumsily walk towards Ripley. He swings his arm back and plants one hell of a bitch-slap across my cheek. I'm too drunk to notice the pain, but the meaning connected. I disappointed him, almost widowed his daughter, threw away my life. I deserved it. But what came next surprised me. He pulled me into a hug. A fatherly hug. A hug I hadn't felt since I was little. \"Don't ever scare me like that, ever again, son.\"\n\"I'm sorry I'm such a fuck-up. At the golf course, I should have taken your help.\"\n\"It's okay. I've seen some shit in my life, I was trying to tell you how serious of a problem it is. I know what it's like, son.\"\n\"You sounded so disapproving, I thought I was coming off as a weakling.\" I break out in tears.\n\"Son, that stuff is no joke, and it doesn't make you weak. What makes you a weakling is trying to run from it.\"\n\"I should have told Lucy like I said I would...I kept hearing these doubts in my head, that we can't have kids, that I can't help her with her problems, that I can't make it better, only worse. Samantha mentioned she wanted grandkids. I...I...I'm a fucking loser...\"\nRipley just holds me there. \"Let's get you home...\" He eventually pushes me towards his car, but before I could take a step I heave and push myself away from him, vomiting all over the sidewalk. Ripley patiently waits for me to finish my pathetic display, and after he helps me crash on the back seat, we drive.\n\nI continue crying to myself. At all the shit that was going on. How could I become so fucking lost in everything? All this time I tried to be someone's support, yet too afraid to take my own advice? In hindsight, it all seemed too simple. In my drunken state, I could barely form coherent thoughts. The thoughts I did have felt more distant, more like back when it started. \n'She would understand'\n'After all, she suffers just like you'\n'You can rely on her, just like she can on you...'\n'And you have a family'\n\nAs I step into our living room, Lucy comes rushing in and flies into my arms. \"I'm so glad you are back. I was so scared!\" I just hug her back, her tears are seeping into my shoulder. As best I can, I just calmly rock her back and forth, saying \"Don't be. I'm sorry for worrying you. I shouldn't have flipped out at you preening, I-I should have been there for you. I know how it feels, now...\"\n\nAs we sit on the sofa, I lay it all out to her, my troubles, my doubts, the voice, even the flashback at the golf course. Everything. I'm not holding any details back. I explain how I would wake up early, run to clear my head.\nI explain how I came upon the bar.\nHow getting buzzed drowned out the thoughts.\nHow it kept getting worse and worse.\nAnd how scared I was of telling her because I thought she needed me to be strong.\nAnd how sure I was I could deal with it all...just ignore it and not worry her with my own problems.\nRipley just sits through it all, waiting patiently to finish. Just like all those years ago on the rooftop, Lucy just lets me vent it all out, without interrupting.\nAfter I'm done, she smiles somberly. \"You should have told me.\"\n\"I know...I'm so sorry.\"\n\nWe just sit there, her left arm draped around my shoulder, her right grasping mine. Eventually, my tears run out and I compose myself. Looking straight at Ripley, I manage but a few simple words: \"Thank you.\"\n\nAfter a short while, Lucy lifts her head. She suddenly seems very lively but also anxious. Her eyes darting around at me, Ripley, the ground like she's not sure of something. \"Well, there is one worry I can clear up right now,...\" she says: \"...and I wanted to tell you in the morning, but...\" She grabs both of my hands, sighing softly and inhaling like she has to prepare for something, and I prepare for the worst. \"Anon. Dad. I'm pregnant.\" \nThe words hit me like a sledgehammer, that's great news and I feel the sadness and worry slowly fade away. I feel ecstatic, even, but the words fail me. \"That's wonderful...\" I manage to stammer out. Ripley just smiles in approval. \n\nOnly one thought lingers in my mind as I try to internalize it: \"I'm gonna be a father...\"\n\n'You are going to be a great father'\n\n==================================================================================\n\nTherapy has been going great. Talking to a professional who doesn't want to just hook me on some drugs to collect an easy paycheck sure helps. The doubts and worries slowly cleared up over time. As for the flashbacks, I was told I should seek some Veterans groups and talk with them about it. There is a meeting every other weekend I can attend, where some vets just get together and talk about their experiences. That may help, but I'm also told that if it doesn't, I should monitor when and how they happen, what triggers them, and if the situation turns worse. Jeff and Ripley were a great help with that, they told me about their own experiences, and how they cope with them. Turns out the alcohol wasn't the thing that drowned the worries out, I recall that every time I went to that bar, I would talk with Jeff about something from my time overseas.\nAnd apparently, Jeff has some flashbacks too, sometimes. But he says you can live with it if you have to. They are just a minor inconvenience sometimes.\n\nI have been spending a lot more time with Ripley. I realized how absolutely stupid it was to just run away and try to deal with everything myself. I feel a lot better now than I have in months, and all it took was just overcoming my stupid selfishness, again. It's like I forgot everything I learned in Highschool. Everything Lucy helped me realize about myself back then.\n\nOverall, the future looks bright, as I sit on a bench in the park, rubbing the growing belly of my wife while she lays her head on my shoulder. Whatever challenges may come our way, I'm sure we can face them, together.\n\nThe end.","Title":"Ending 3 - Ghosts of the Past","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Ripley, Samantha and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Grenadieranon","Summary":"After learning valuable lessons of support, and marrying a woman that relies on it, what happens when these lessons aren't obeyed as you fall into the same hole you try to dig someone else out of?"},"Ending 4 - Estrus Season.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Ending 4 - Estrus Season.txt"],"text":"Title: Ending 4 - Estrus Season\nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Fang, Samantha, Ripley, Naser, Reed, Trish and Anon\nRating: Semi-NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: EstrusAnon\n\n\n\"Got you\" laughed the Dino patriarch\nI sighed as his last piece slid into place.\nGiving him the 4 in a row to win.\nAgain.\nHe had beaten me 5 times in 10 minutes.\nI'm not even sure this latest game lasted the 2 minutes average you\u2019d think.\nWhy in the world was he so good at this game?\nWhatever, connect 4 is bullshit anyways.\n\"Don't be sore, Anon.

I don't think anyone noticed. I hope not.\nThinking back on it, this was our first time together for this holiday though.

I was so surprised I thought she was trying to eat him.\nIn a way she was.\nI think they might have always had a thing for each other. \nThe things that happen in life can be amazing, I ponder.\n\"Have you heard anything from Lucy, Anon?\" Naser was checking his own phone while asking\n\"Not yet\" I reply, looking at my own.\nReed does the same.\n\"Nothing from Trish\".\n\"Oh don't worry boys, they have things that need to be taken care of.\" Samantha reassured us.\nAnd to kill any further questions she added.\n\"Lady things that need addressing\".\nSamantha moved around the table, cleaning up trash and clearing dishes.\nI moved to help but she waved me down.\n\"I got it dear\".\nA saint as always, the way everyone was talking it seemed like all the females would be going crazy tonight.\n\"Oh as you get older you don't get as wild\" She looked my way.\nMumbling you betrayed me again.\nI noticed Ridley shifted in his seat when she said that last part.\nWas that relief on his face?\nJust then the grandfather clock chimed 11 PM.\nEveryone looked up.\nBig old thing, I remember seeing it when I first came by Fang's house, all those years ago.\n\"Time to get going\" Naser said\nHe got out of his seat, everyone else followed suit.\nAs we made for the door Ridley cleared his throat.\n\"Alright then, everyone be safe and don't do anything stupid\".\nHe looked my way and put his hand on my shoulder.\n\"Anon, you may be married to my daughter but if I hear bad things from her, your ass is still mine\". His grip tightened.\nSome things never change.\n\"Right\" I coughed out.\nDamn his talons still hurt like hell.\n\"Come one, let's go, if we take too long...\".\nNaser trailed off.\n\"He's right boys, get going. It's not polite to keep ladies waiting\".\nSamantha started to shepherd us out the door.\nIt was then that I noticed her face was red, and her neck too.\nShe seemed to catch my concerned look.\n\"Come on now, get out\".\nShe said that with some pretty heavy oomph.\nHer eyes were... sharp, very focused.\nLike a hunter being interrupted during her kill.\nRidley turned toward her with a look of fear.\nThe last thing I saw before she shut the door was the mallet in her hands.\nThe last thing I heard was the sound of the lock on the door going into place.\nThe last thing I felt was vibrations, of something heavy running. Followed by something lighter chasing.\nThat was....concerning.\nWhy the mallet?\nAs if reading my mind Naser spoke up not even turning his head\n\"Let's go and don't worry about it. Dad can handle himself\".\nHe was very calm about this, even though I feel like I would get a little sick from the thought of my folks going at it.\nHe started walking and Reed looked at me.\nHe shrugged.\nWith that we followed him to the Nascar, not saying anything. Once we hopped in he started out the driveway.\nI think I just heard a door slam somewhere in the house.\nThen again maybe not.\nNaser pulls onto the road and takes off at his usual speed.\nIt was then I noticed his phone started buzzing.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe've been driving for about 20 minutes at this point.\nOther than Nasers phone vibrating the entire time not much was said.\n\"Bro, aren't you going to pick that up\" Reed asked eventually.\nNaser shook his head.\n\"I know who's calling\".\nMakes one of us at least.\nHe looked at us from his rear view mirror.\n\"My girlfriend,\" He finally said.\n\"Are you guys fighting then?\"  Reed fumbled with his own phone.\n\"We're fine, she's just... in a mood. Because of tonight you know\".\nI didn't.\nReed's phone suddenly rang, he had a song from the old band as a ringtone, Cute.\nThey still jam together every now and then. They have gotten a lot better too.\nHe answered it.\n\"Trish hey....no we are on the way...yea I-.... yea sure. Uh Anon is here too\".\nI could only hear her tone and not the actual words, but she seemed normal enough.\nSame old loud Trish.\n\"....Ok see you soon. Love you too\" Reed said that last part a little quieter. Then ended the call.\nAwww, to be in love.\n\"Everything good?\" I asked.\nReed looked at me and shrugged.\n\"Yea, she just wanted to know where we were and stuff\"\nJust then my phone started ringing. I checked the caller. It was Fang...\nDid my heart just skip a beat?\nI answered, \"Hey Fang what's up?\"\n\"Just checking to make sure you're on your way,\" She said.\nHoly fuck was her voice always this sweet?\n\"You picked up that box of condoms right?\"\nWe had stopped by the gas station on the way home. She wanted me to pick up a big box.\n\"Yea I have them. Are you feeling ok?\" I ask.\n\"Do you mean if I'm some sex crazed maniac?\" she nearly laughed.\nThe thought had crossed my mind.\n\"I'm fine, hurry up and get home it's almost midnight.\"\nFang sounded normal just like Trish.\n\"We'll be there in a few minutes\" I looked out the window to see where we were.\nWas my palm getting sweaty?\n\"Good, see you then. Love you\" she whispered that last part.\n\"Love you too\" I answered.\nThe call ended, she had hung up.\nMy heart did skip a beat that time for sure hearing \"Love you\"\nI really really wanted to see Fang....\nWhat the fuck is in this medicine?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs we stepped out from the Nascar into the driveway of our home, Naser wished us luck. \n\"You'll need it\" is all he said. \nBefore Reed or I could say anything back he sped off in his usual manner. \nThough I will admit it was a bit faster than normal. \n\"I think his phone was still buzzing,\" I mentioned to Reed. \nIn fact it had not once stopped during our ride here. Though he did send a few texts.\n\"Guess his girlfriend really wanted to talk to him about tonight\".\nI think Reed was trying to ease the tension in the air, but for the life of me Naser sure looked ..Focused.\nI should be concerned by that.\nI mean even for a med student those eyes were laser focused. \nHe's been with this girl for a while, for sure even during Estrus Season.\n...I still couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.\nTrish and Fang were \"getting ready\" together. I think the plan was for Reed to head out with Trish back to their place. Our home had been closer so it just made things easier to do it here, Fang had said.\nTurning back to our house everything looked calm enough.\nNo lights on but other than that... \n\"Huh, don't know what I was expecting\" Reed chimed. \nI didn't either, it was just another night I suppose when you really get down to it. \n\"Fang sounded fine on the phone, maybe we are just getting taken for a ride?\" \nReed looked at me, rolled his eyes and shrugged. \nGuess it was my turn for a joke to fall flat. \nStill, I did notice a small smirk. Bros to the end.\nThinking back to the last few hours.\nThe way that Samantha acted on our way out of the home.\nThat and Ridley's face once she told us to \"get out\".\nThere was the issue of all the running that I heard too...\nAll this build up for something that happens yearly.\nI'm worrying too much, Fang sounded perfectly in control on the phone.\nDefinitely not like some hormone crazed dino goth wife.\nI was kind of disappointed in a way.\nI was also worrying too much...\nGo home Anon, go home to your perfect wife and enjoy the holiday.\nWith that we walked up the steps and I unlocked the door. \nIt was dark inside, what with there being no lights on. \nAlso really quiet, like dead silent. \n\"What, you don't have lights in your house bro? Should look into them, pretty cool\" \n\"Of course we do, you've been over lots of times\" I reply trying to flip a light switch. \nWhat is the bulb gone or something? \nI look inside... it actually was gone. \nAlarms start to go off in my head, did someone break in? \nIs Fang Ok? Is Trish?\nI see Reed get a worried look too.\nWe hurry into the living room. \nReed Calles out for Trish, I Fang.\nThere was no reply. \nI think it's fair to say I was starting to panic a little. \nI had just talked to Fang what, 10 minutes ago on the phone? \nMy mind was racing. What could have happened?\nThat's when I noticed it. \nThe change was subtle I'll admit, a shift in movement. The soft sound of breathing. \nRight on the edge of hearing, in that zone where you're not sure if it was real or not. \nAs if on command with that thought, a lamp flicked to life. \nRevealing 2 figures standing behind us. \nWe turned, and I swear Reed's jaw dropped wider than I've ever seen. \nI should know, mine did too. \nStanding in the light was Fang and Trish. \nThank Raptor Jesus, they were healthy and not ax murdered as feared.\nWhat was not expected was the lingerie they had chosen to wear for the occasion. \nFrilly underwear from an expensive brand. \nFamiliar actually, like I've seen them wear it before somewhere. \nWhich is impossible since I've never seen them together in their underwear of course\nI also noticed that I could see my wifes markings.\nThe kind that I needed a black light to see.\nI should be curious about that, but right now I didn't seem to mind.\n\"Fan-\" I start to stammer before being cut off by sudden movement. \nTrish had lunged toward Reed, tackling him to the ground as he yelped. \nIt was fast, precise, terrifying. \nHe was pinned flat on his back and she was on top. \nTrish had a wicked smile on her face.\nRed along her face and neckline.\nHer breathing heavy.\nPure lust in her eyes.\nAll targeted towards Reed.\nShe gave him a quick kiss on the lips.\nI think she might have snuck a bite in there as well.\nThat looked like it hurt.\nBefore Reed could even speak, before he could do anything, she grabbed his tail and dragged him toward the guest bedroom. \nKnocking over a corner table with his flailing body. \nShe quickly turned the corner and went inside, Reed managed to grab onto the door frame and looked at me. \nI could only see his head and arms holding him in place. In his eyes I saw a myriad of emotions. \nFear, Surprise, confusion and....bliss? \nI swear he gave me a shit eating grin before He was pulled in and the door slammed shut. \nThe entire assault could have only been a few seconds. \n\"How did-\" \nBefore I could finish I felt 2 taloned hands grab me by the shoulders. \nI spun to see Fang within inches of my face. \nHer lovely Snoot right by my lips. I could feel her breathing.\nThose Eyes locked into mine. Beautiful amber eyes, starlight in living form.\nLike Trish, she moved quickly; Unlike Trish it was silent and graceful. I should have been shocked, maybe a little scared.\nRight now however, the feeling was something else.\nStill I should have seen her coming. \nMaybe the medicine had something to do with it, maybe not.\nThen it clicked, the pieces falling into place.\nTrish moved first to throw my attention from Fang. \nWith my gaze shifted Fang simply moved into striking range. \nClever girl, I never even stood a chance. \n\"Got you\" she whispered. Low and full of seduction.\n\"Yea, you do\" was all I managed out.\nShe did after all.\n-----------------------\n\nTo say that Fang had me dead to rights was pretty accurate.\nHer hands were tight, but then slackened. \nI took the chance to wrap my own around her waist, brought her in close, and did the only thing that was on my mind.\nI kissed her.\nSweet Raptor Jesus I kissed her.\nHer body was hot, radiating heat.\nI could feel myself getting pretty warm too.\nWhen we finally parted, leaving a trail of saliva between, Fang grabbed my hand and interlocked fingers with mine.\nI should mention that her face had that same reddish pink hue her mom had. It went down her neckline and on her chest. Her breasts were also red, and a bit fuller may I add.\nShe turned toward the stairs, to our bedroom and with our hands still locked together made a run for it.\nI ran with her with all my heart. \nWe made it up the stairs and through the door leading into our room.\nWe crashed on the bed kissing and flailing.\nEven a giggle or two was heard.\nMy shirt came off before I fully landed, shoes and socks flying in opposite directions not long after. Also my pants were gone at some point, though I don\u2019t remember when.\nThis medicine was doing something to me and I think I figured it out.\nI don\u2019t think I would survive the night without it. It was probably doing something to my body to make me more...viable for the holiday.\nThe only thing I had left was my boxers.\nI went to take off Fangs...outfit.\nI expected the top to have some sort of hook or clip but it just popped off, ease of access.\nI liked that.\nShe removed the rest with a swift motion and mounted me.\nHer full glory was visible, time slowed down a bit and I took in the view.\nI see now why no one wanted to talk about tonight, you really did just have to experience it.\nA thought than popped into my mind, I reached down into my jacket on the floor and pulled out the box of condoms\n\u201cFang wait\u201d I said, holding up the box.\nShe gave a deep loving smile.\n\u201cYou remembered, good boy,\u201d she purred.\nThen she slapped the box right out of my hand.\n\u201cBut no\u201d The package went flying into the wall.\nIt exploded, it\u2019s guts flying out.\nIt slumped to the floor, dead.\n\u201cOh\u201d I looked into those Amber eyes again.\nI see, she never really wanted them. Just another thing to make sure I didn't run. I don\u2019t think there was enough in the box for tonight anyways.\nWho would ever run from this?\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised\u201d She leaned in and grabbed my face. Bringing hers in closer.\n\u201cThe stories mom told me about what it took to catch dad\u201d She kissed me before I could ask for specifics.\nI didn't have the breath to talk after that regardless.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nMore to come...","Title":"Ending 4 - Estrus Season","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Fang, Samantha, Ripley, Naser, Reed, Trish and Anon","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"EstrusAnon"},"Escape From The Skin-Dome.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Escape From The Skin-Dome.txt"],"text":"Title: Escape From The Skin-Dome\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Trish and Reed\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\nSummary: Trish and Reed overstay their visit to Anon\u2019s house\n\n\nThe floor of Anon\u2019s house was covered in a thick white sheet of\u2026something, impeding Trish\u2019s movement as she and Reed desperately sprinted towards the door. What remained of the smoldering embers of Trish\u2019s fury were currently directed towards the pink raptor, his much longer legs allowing him to push through the drifts of not-quite-snow with realitive ease. Damn Anon! Why did his house have to have that most disgusting of human characteristics, dandruff?\n\nAt first, it had been fun, playing in the dandruff with Reed. Anon wasn\u2019t there, instead asleep in his room. He hadn\u2019t necessarily invited them over, so-to-speak, but as the sky began disgorging its bounty of white, Trish and Reed decided they might as well spend some time playing while waiting for him to wake up. It was Reed\u2019s idea to masquerade as Dirty Dino first, and Trish couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to put him into place. She was damned if she was going to be Pinhead again! Unfortunately, their roughhousing had attracted the attention of Anon; who, still half-asleep, had stormed out of his room and beat the living shit out of the both of them, burying them in a shallow grave of white. So, Trish had decided to get the fuck out of there, and forget what Fang or Anon would think!\n\nPanting, the VVURM DRAMA duo finally manage to reach the entrance, the massive steel door Anon had fitted to protect himself from Skin Row crazies looming above them (well, above Trish). Shouldering her friend out of the way, Trish heaved at the peculiar wheel-shaped handle, her muscles straining as she twisted with all her might. \n\n\u201cUrgh\u2026Fuck!\u201d Gritting her teeth, Trish doubled-down on her attempts to open their way to freedom, Reed standing silently behind her. The handle was covered in some unfamiliar excretions, no doubt some disgusting skinny residue that Anon had failed to clean off. Suddenly, Trish\u2019s hands slipped, her momentum sending her fists smacking straight into Reed\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cOw!\u201d Reed exclaimed, a good second or two after Trish had made contact. Trish wasn\u2019t sure if he was just saying ow to spare her feelings (she knew she wasn\u2019t as strong as she looked), or if he was just too stoned to care.\n\n\u201cSorry Reed, but the door is locked!\u201d Trish pointed at the door handle, where a semi-transparent mucus had covered the lock completely. They were trapped!\n\n\u201cLet me have a try.\u201d Brows furrowing, Reed strolled with the upmost confidence past his diminutive friend, chest puffed out and shoulders squared. Pausing in front of the door, Reed spat dramatically on both his palms. Trish could feel a flutter of excitement in her chest: Reed was stronger than he looked, and with the amount of carfe current coursing through his powerful, thick veins, there was no way he could fail! Squaring up with the door, Reed throw his arms back, his sinuous biceps flexing as he prepared his own attempt at opening the door. This was going to work! This was-\n\n\u201cOpen sesame!\u201d Reed shouted, at the same time thrusting his hands forward dramatically. Trish stared, open-mouthed, her expression flying from rage to sadness and back to rage in the span of a microsecond. The door remained resolutely shut. Shrugging, Reed walked back to Trish, the purple Trigger\u2019s face incandescent with rage.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve done all I can do.\u201d ","Title":"Escape From The Skin-Dome","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Trish and Reed","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous","Summary":"Trish and Reed overstay their visit to Anon\u2019s house"},"Everyone Needs A Hand.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Everyone Needs A Hand.txt"],"text":"Title: Everyone Needs A Hand\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Trish, Reed, Spears and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how fast shit can go wrong when you\u2019re not looking.\nI turned back into the presentation on the first picture. Displayed on the projection screen was a human and a poorly photoshopped, low-quality image of a nondescript anime girl with the human wrapping his arm around the image. I snorted trying to suppress my laughter. As funny as it was to be smacked in the face by some high-quality cringe in the middle of a school presentation the familiarity of the human on the screen bugged me. I recognized the green jacket pretty fast and along with my very small pool of human friends determined the person on the screen was none other than Anon.\nSpeaking of Anon, he had already knocked over the projector and bolted for the door while I was still figuring out who was up there. The slam of the auditorium door and the laughter of the other students reminded me of where I was.  I turned to look at Reed getting up off the floor. His eyes that were on the door swing over to me and then turned to focus on something behind me. I followed his eyes to see Trish, standing near the far corner looking at the auditorium door. When her gaze turns to me, she flinches, and a look of guilt crosses her face which then disappears into the principal\u2019s giant mitt as it engulfs her head.\nPrincipal Spears quiets the students and gets the teachers to send them back to class. Our peers are still chuckling and jeering at the presentation. Spears escorts Trish away to the office and I\u2019m left alone with Reed in the auditorium.\nI\u2019m rooted to the spot trying to sort out all the new information dropped on me in the past few minutes. Anon is a weeb and pretty cringy too, which didn\u2019t make sense since he seemed to hold a level of contempt for anything anime. In the times he was around Stella when she rambled on about a show, he seemed uncomfortable. If I was being honest, he didn\u2019t seem to have a great passion for anything in particular, just a lot of mismatched knowledge. He would be willing to discuss most anything, but he never had a thing of his own.\n\u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d Reed huffs out turning away from the now righted projector.\n\u201cWhat do you mean. You\u2019re the one running the projector. I thought you would know.\u201d I snapped.\nReed shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know how those pics got on there either. I got the presentation from Naomi.\u201d\n\u201cThen what was with Trish?\u201d I asked.\nReed Shrugged \u201cDon\u2019t know, but I asked Trish to get the USB for me while I was working on the projector. I have no idea why she would be spooked unless\u2026\u201d Reed\u2019s dawning realization turned to an uncomfortable grimace.\n\u201cReed, I know Anon, and Trish don\u2019t get along but this? She wouldn\u2019t go that far, would she?\u201d I lock eyes with Reed. The look he gives me says more than enough.\n \nThe walk to the principal\u2019s office is quiet between the two of us. The surrounding students chatter amongst themselves, all of it about the recent presentation. I had to fight myself to not shout at them, it\u2019s not like it would have done much anyway. A part of me I glad Anon left when he did, walking around as it is now would have been shit. I always got the feeling he didn\u2019t like to be the center of attention.\nBut Anon running off was out of character for him the more I thought about it. In the few months that I\u2019ve known him, he\u2019s been pretty unflappable, the essence of quiet, calm, and collected. Rarely a word said without consideration and always cautious of his actions. He was a peculiar silent rock, to Reed\u2019s cool stream and Trish\u2019s passionate fire. To see that solid fa\u00e7ade crack was unsettling, especially considering what he told me about himself on the roof and if he truly meant it. I sneak a quick peek at my phone, still no replies from anon. The feeling of isolation sticks with me as Reed, and I continue onward.\n \nHearing the principal before seeing the office gave quick insight into how Trish was doing. I wanted to feel bad for her, She\u2019s my friend obviously, but the fact that this was at the expense of Anon smothered what sympathy I had.  From beyond the door, I could hear spears talking about detentions, calling parents, and suspensions. Reed and I waited in silence outside the office room listening to the verbal beatdown.\nWhen Trish emerged, she looked like shit, similar to a dog being drenched in cold water. Tears stained her cheeks, snot dribbled out of her snout, and her face looked pale. Her gaze was locked to the floor, hugging herself for comfort and trembling slightly. For a few seconds, I realized that I was planning to rip into the last bits of my best friend\u2019s ego. Taking a deep breath, I reigned myself in.\nTrish pulled her eyes from the floor to look at Reed and me, but the room remained quiet. Trish bit her lip looking at the both of us. I turned to look at Reed, he was looking at anywhere else but Trish. I decided to take the initiative.\n\u201cWhat going on Trish?\u201d\nShe wrung her hands together. \u201cI was just trying to help.\u201d Her voice was meek.\n\u201cHow? By driving away the first new friend I\u2019ve made in god knows how long?\u201d I shot back.\n\u201cI was trying to protect you, Fang,\u201d Trish said finally looking me in the eye. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what?\u201d I asked frustrated.\n\u201cFrom him!\u201d Trish gesturing to something in the distance \u201cSome literal nobody transfer student strolls up and starts making changes to how we run the band, starts trying to change you. why wouldn\u2019t I be concerned?\u201d Trish\u2019s tone and demeanor becoming more resolute.\n\u201cCome on, you barely got to know him at all.\u201d I spoke, \u201cAnd what do you mean by changing me?\u201d Fixing her with a stern look.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, he hasn\u2019t told us anything about him, what he likes, where he\u2019s from, skills, talents, anything!\u201d She listed off exasperated, \u201cAnd when we asked, he always dodged the question. He never told us why he transferred here. How the fuck can you trust someone like that? There is nothing to know.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d I shot back, upgrading the look to a glare.\nShe let out a sigh before meeting my glare \u201cYou came to me bawling your eyes out months ago Fang, saying that you were fed up with your own identity. I\u2019m trying to make sure you didn\u2019t have another breakdown.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not some stupid schizo, Trish.\u201d I growled out between gritted teeth\nTrish flinched back \u201cFang, I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s not wh\u2014\u201d\nI shoved her in the shoulder \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t ask for some crazy bitch to babysit me!\u201d\nIncensed Trish shouted back \u201cI\u2019m trying to help you like you fucking asked me to Fang!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to dictate my life!\u201d\n\u201cThen what do you need me for!\u201d\n\u201cTo ruin my life apparently!\u201d\nTrish\u2019s recoiled back as if burned.\n\u201cHEY!\u201d Reed shouted, getting in between us, and pushing the two of us apart \u201cEnough this shit.\u201d\nWe both turned to look at him, his face was furious.\n\u201cI know everyone is a little heated right now but let\u2019s not say things someone is going to regret\u201d He turned to Trish first. \u201cNow I understand where you\u2019re coming from Trish trust me, Anon has changed a lot of stuff but he\u2019s cool. I\u2019d say give him a shot; the dude is just shy I think.\u201d Reed offered.\nTrish refused to meet his eyes, her tail curling around her leg. Reed turned and leveled a disappointed look at me.\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t think you think that went a bit far with that?\u201d He said quietly, \u201cShe\u2019s our friend, and didn\u2019t you hear her? Trish was doing what she thought was right.\u201d\n\u201cLook I\u2019m sorry for yelling but\u2026\u201d Reed looking tired. \u201cCan\u2019t you guys\u2019 sort this out? I don\u2019t want to lose my best friend right at the end of the year.\u201d\nTrish and I turned back to each other. She looked ashamed but resolute in her opinion.\n\u201cTrish, you Doxed him in front of the whole school, how is that protecting me?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cHe\u2019s gone now, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking\u201d. Trish squirmed in her spot trying to find an answer.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t what you to start questioning who you were again and freak out. It hurt me enough to see you like that when you came to me the first time.\u201d\n\u201cTrish I\u2019ve been questioning who I am for a while, but Anon\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSee!\u201d Trish interjected. \u201cAnon is the problem!\u201d\nI turned to look at Reed, gesturing to Trish, I got an awkward apologetic shrug for my troubles.\n\u201cAnon helped me calm down on the roof, not make it worse.\u201d I huffed out turning back to the triceratops. \u201cI was starting to be more comfortable with everything because of him\u201d\n\u201cReally someone like that?\u201d Trish asked flabbergasted.\nI replied with no uncertainty \u201cYes, I just think he needs some help too.\u201d\nTrish shuffled through a few emotions, anger, confusion, arousal, despair, then back to anger before finally releasing one big sigh. That sigh seemed to take her spirit with it because instead of the previous stubborn frustration she just looked tired, defeated even.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nI was taken aback by how honest that sounded. A clean admittance to guilt, a genuine apology for her actions.\n\u201cYou should say that to Anon,\u201d Trish winces but does not reply. \u201cAnd for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry I said you were ruining my life\u201d I finish. Trish looks back at me, her face cautious, searching for deceit of any kind.\n\u201cSo, this is the end of the band I guess?\u201d\nI turn to look at Reed, forgetting he was here. The raptor pushes himself off the wall to join us again, a frown marring his normally placid face. Guilt pricks at me knowing that\u2019s probably for the best. However, the implied second meaning to his words brings more of a stabbing fear to my heart than a prick. A feeling of warmth and the image of a green jacket cuts through.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be forever,\u201d I shot out. Trish and Reed turn to look at me shocked. \u201cJust for right now.\u201d\nTrish deflates a little while Reed smiles and nods, seemingly assured that everything will work out. He guides Trish to the hall, beginning his own speech to her. I share one last glance with Trish before she leaves.\n\u201cMrs. Aron?\u201d\nThe soft voice of the principal startled me. Spears can be surprisingly quiet when he wants to be. A small voice that sounds like Nazer brings up something about \u2018genetic hunting instincts\u2019.\n\u201cCould I have a moment of your time?\u201d\nHe beckoned me into his office and presented the chairs. I move to take the comfy chair of the two in front of the desk. Closing the door and taking a seat in his office chair which had his formal coat draped around the backrest.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be frank, I would like you to check on Mr. Mous.\u201d He stated.\nCold fear settled in my stomach. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is he ok?\u201d I leaned forward in my seat, grabbing at the armrests.\nThe principal\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cAs far as I know he is alright. The reason I called you in here is that I want you to check on him. I tried contacting him, but he has not given much of a response besides simple answers. I think he needs the support of a friend right now.\u201d\nMy stomach grew colder. \u201cBut shouldn\u2019t the school handle that?\u201d I blurted out.\nSpears sighed \u201cThe school is not equipped to dispense wellness checks to students, there are also liability issues to consider, I am asking you because I believe that you can help Anon find his footing so to speak. He seemed like a rather independent young man but I believe he needs a little help right now.\u201d The principal gave me a sympathetic look. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel pressured into it, I will go to check up on him myself if you do not feel up to it.\u201d\nI felt bolted to the seat. The idea of helping Anon sounded great but having to help deal with his own meltdown scared me. I could barely deal with my own episodes why did Spears think I could do this.\nThe kindly face of the principal reassured me of my possible options. I could leave this to him, and he would go to Anon and talk him into coming back to school if I left it to him. But the guilt of running away caused my stomach to flop. The vista of Volcaldera springs fresh in my mind, the feeling of warmth, acceptance.\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him, principal Spears.\u201d\nThe principal smiles. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Aron, I can arrange transportation to his address.\u201d\n \nThe ride over was nerve-racking, thinking over what I could say. The cabbie, some raptor with weird eyebrows, seemed to get the hint I didn\u2019t want to talk and keep the radio down. The walk up to his apartment was even worse, not just because of where I was but also because I still had no idea what to say. The door seemed more imposing the closer I got to it. Before I can chicken out, I knock on the door.\n\u201cAnon! It\u2019s me, Fang! Open up!\u201d\nThere is no response.\n\u201cCome on dweeb, open the door! I know you are in there!\u201d\nA cold silence echoes back. For a second, I think about leaving. The neighbors can probably hear me and some of the people in the hall turn to look at me, judging. What the fuck am I doing.\n\u201cEveryone will probably forget about the slide show in a week! Remember the band!? Anon, I\u2019m sorry I laughed! I didn\u2019t mean it! Please open the door!\u201d\nThere is no sound of shuffling or movement, not even a courtesy \u2018fuck off\u2019 to turn me away. I would have been alright with that, at least I know he\u2019s still in there. I start slamming on the door shouting louder.\n\u201cOpen the door dumbass! I want to see if you\u2019re alright in there! Now open up!\u201d\n A sickening fear creeps up my throat. Anon didn\u2019t seem like the type of person to do something drastic. He always seemed like the kind of guy to really think things through. But I had been shouting and slamming on the door for what felt like minutes now. That should get some thing, right? \n\u201cAnon, I\u2019m serious open the fucking door! I know you can hear me! HEY! Stop messing with me Anon!\u201d\n\u201cPlease say something\u201d I plead to the door. The silence seems to be mocking me at this point. A flash of anger spits forth.\n\u201cWas all that shit on the roof just you bullshitting out an answer?! Were you just lying about that \u2018Be YoUrSeLf\u2019 stuff!? HUH?! FUCKING COWARD!!\u201d\nI finish my rant by hammering both fists into the door. A resounding \u2018THWAM\u2019 followed by silence.\n\u201cPlease tell me that wasn\u2019t bullshit.\u201d I plead once more.\n\u201cFang?\u201d\nThe was open just a crack. In that gap stands Anon. His face looks paler than usual, with paranoia covering his features. We both look at each other through the open sliver for a moment before I lunge and push the door open. Wings and arms dragging him into my tight embrace planting a smooch on his cheek, his own arms reflexively wrapping around me. Pulling away I give him a quick once over. Hair, None to pull out, arms, nothing.\n\u201cThank Raptor Jesus your alright, you had me going there for a sec.\u201d I giggled out; the previous hysteria was washed away by relief. Anon still looks stunned at my intrusion into his home.\n\u201cSo, this is where you live? No wonder you\u2019re on welfare.\u201d I continue. Anon slowly comes back to cognizance, a look of guilt on his face.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you wait out there\u201d he apologizes softly, his face twisting in shame \u201cand for the stuff I said on the roof.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, it was good advice\u201d I correct quickly \u201cThat is if you actually believe it.\u201d\nAnon leans away resting his back against a nearby wall seemingly trying to squeeze himself smaller.\n\u201cI thought I did, but you saw the presentation.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you should try to be honest about who you are.\u201d I quip. Anon gives me a sour look at having his own words of wisdom used against him.\n\u201cTo be honest I still don\u2019t know who I want to be but trying to stay to who me is has helped in its own ways,\u201d I said, trying to give the lonely human some faith in his own words.\nAnon seems to consider this for a few moments, quietly contemplating his own interpretation of his words. Looking back at me his face stretches into a wry grin his cheeks looking a little pink.\n\u201cSo, were you fucking with me on the roof, or do dinos really kiss like that?\u201d\nMy own face lights with embarrassment, before we both burst into laughs.\nMaybe Reed was right.","Title":"Everyone Needs A Hand","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed, Spears and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Fang-Anon Bodyswap Alternate.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Fang-Anon Bodyswap Alternate.txt"],"text":"Title: Fang\/Anon Bodyswap Alternate\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Naser and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-off\nAuthor: SurpriseVisitor\nSummary: Anon wakes up in Fang's body and Fang wakes up in Anon's. Fang takes the opportunity to bring the two of them closer together than any other couple on earth.\n\n\nI scrunch my face and stretch my limbs as the final afterthoughts of some bizarre dream involving sprouting wings and flying fade into the background of my mind. A breathy groan escapes me as I blink the sleep from my eyes, sitting up straight in my bed. I stretch again, raising my arms high into the air, and a familiar \u2018vhwoomp\u2019 of feathery wings unfurling sounds from behind me. I look over to my beautiful pterodactyl girlfriend laying beside me, and I do not see my beautiful pterodactyl girlfriend laying beside me. I see a bald human laying beside me. A dashingly handsome bald human, but a bald human my pterodactyl girlfriend is not. \nWhere is my pterodactyl girlfriend? A panicked scream threatens to emerge from me, but I force it down with some effort. This is just another one of Fang\u2019s pranks. Screaming means I lose. I chuckle to myself, having narrowly avoided an embarrassing defeat. I start to reach over to the human costume, but hesitate. What if it\u2019s just a mannequin? I can\u2019t counter-prank a mannequin, I\u2019d look like an idiot for trying. I look closer, and see the rising and falling of its sides. We\u2019re in the clear, counter-prank is a go.\nI reach over towards Fang in a human costume, my pale blue arm and black claws hovering inches from them. Why was my arm pale blue? Why did I have black claws? I pull my hand back and thoroughly inspect it, flexing the fingers and poking the tips of the claws. It\u2019s definitely my hand, but it\u2019s not a hand I remember having. I glance at the pair of angelic wings on full display behind me. I brush the hand through its feathers, feeling the fingers trace through it\u2019s folds. My fingers. On my wings. The wings lightly flap once, the previously unknown joints and muscles feeling distressingly normal. I look down at my black top and...oh my fucking God.\nI tear myself out from under the covers and rush into the bathroom and to the mirror. A panic-stricken Fang looks back at me from inside the mirror. I raise a hand to my face and the Fang inside the mirror does the same. I run my hand across my gargantuan snout and the Fang inside the mirror does the same. I press my hand against the mirror and the Fang inside the mirror does the same. There is no Fang inside the mirror. Just me.\nThe urge to scream fills me a second time, but I force it down again. There\u2019s no need to panic, this is just a dream. A weird, incredibly lucid dream. A weird, incredibly lucid dream where I can physically control limbs and feel body parts that I\u2019ve never had before and would have no possible frame of reference for. Just a dream. I look down again at my black top and\u2026oh my fucking God.\n\u201cAnon!\u201d A scared, confused and distinctly masculine voice calls from the other room. \n\u201cYeah?\u201d A scared, confused and distinctly feminine voice responds from my mouth. Feet hit the floor and rush over to the bathroom door, that dashingly handsome human from before throwing the door open. It\u2019s like I\u2019m looking into a mirror, but that can't be the case because the mirror is on the wall to my right, not panting in the middle of the bathroom in front of me. He slides over next to me, gripping the sinktop and staring into the mirror along with me. We stare together, at each other but not at each other because we were each other and not ourselves. I think.\n\u201cI\u2019m dreaming, right?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m dreaming,\u201d I respond. No, wait, that\u2019s my voice, but not my words. \n\u201cWhat? No. How can you be dreaming if I\u2019m dreaming?\u201d I rebut. We looked at each other like the other one of us was an idiot. \n\u201cFine then, pinch me,\u201d I- he demands.\n\u201cWhat? No, you pinch me,\u201d I counter. We stare at each other, unmoving and unwilling.\n\u201cWhat if we\u2019re both dreaming?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d \n\u201cDoes any of this make any sense?\u201d I wildly gesture to myself. He grumbles in response. We return to inspecting ourselves in the mirror, hands brushing across our new features. Snout, crest, tail, weird elbow feathers, and...oh my fucking God.\n\u2026\nI have boobs. And not disgusting man titties either; actual, female breasts. Modest breasts, but breasts nonetheless. I bring a hand to my chest, but Fang- no, Anon- no...Fang-Anon...catches it with his own. He moves behind me, entangling our fingers and wrapping our arms around my waist, pressing his chin on my shoulder and his cheek against mine. \n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, simply and coolly. The embrace goes a long way towards calming me down, and I let out a long breath.\n\u201cHey,\u201d I respond. He starts lightly rocking me side to side, rubbing my thumbs with his. I close my eyes and sigh. It\u2019s weird, but we\u2019re still us. \n\u201cI\u2019ve got a pretty good idea.\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His hands drag mine across my feathery exterior towards my midriff.\n\u201cWay I see it, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, right?\u201d\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d He shifts his head further into mine, making me blush a little more.\n\u201cWe have a chance to become closer than any other couple on Earth,\u201d he whispers. \n\u201cWha-\u201d My blush explodes across my face. Before I can protest, the phone in my pocket buzzes.\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Fang says quietly. With my voice. \u201cThat\u2019s gotta be Naser. He\u2019s gonna want me back today. He\u2019s gonna want you back today.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well that..oh...fuck.\u201d The realization dawns on me far later than it should have. The blush drains from me as I pull the phone out and turn the screen on, blankly staring at the password screen for a moment.\n\u201cFour ones,\u201d Fang comments. I input the password I definitely didn\u2019t know before just now and a notification pops up on the screen. Naser did in fact want Fang back later today. \n\u201cUh, what are you gonna tell him?\u201d I ask tentatively. \n\u201cWhat am I gonna tell him? What are you gonna tell him? You\u2019re Fang.\u201d \n\u201cWhoa whoa whoa, no, no no no, I did not sign up for this shit. He\u2019s still your brother. You are not sending me back with your brother, to your house, with your parents. That is a disaster waiting to happen.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d \n\u201cI wake up in your bed as me, your dad turns my skull into an impromptu golf ball, and the rest of me is buried in six different counties.\u201d \n\u201cAlright, alright, whatever. We gotta come up with something, cause I don\u2019t think Naser or dad are gonna take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer this time around.\u201d \n\u201cWell...what would you normally do in this situation?\u201d\n\u201cTell Naser to fuck off, and hope he does.\u201d Fuck it, guess I\u2019ll give it a shot.\nI open the messenger app, navigate to Naser\u2019s entry and begin typing out a message.\n\u2018Any chance we could move that to tomorrow? Some stuff has kinda come up.\u2019 Almost immediately, a symbol indicating Naser\u2019s incoming response appears.\n\u2018What kind of stuff?\u2019 \n\u2018Important stuff.\u2019 A few seconds pass without an indication of a message being prepared, then the phone starts buzzing wildly. Naser was not content with text and is calling me directly. \n\u201cIt\u2019s all you now, Anon. Fang. You.\u201d Fang-Anon\u2019s voice did not calm me one bit. I swipe the answer icon, and put the phone to my ear-hole...thing. \n\u201cFang? Is everything alright?\u201d Naser\u2019s concern for both himself and me were obvious.\n\u201cYup! All good here!\u201d I hope my anxiety wasn\u2019t obvious in my voice.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Naser\u2019s voice lowers and he whispers through the phone. \u201cDo you need me to call the cops?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, no. I promise, it\u2019s alright.\u201d\n\u201cThen what\u2019s so important?\u201d\n\u201cI...well...you see\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou know dad\u2019s not going to take any old excuse, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know, it\u2019s just...uh\u2026you know, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d believe me if I told you.\u201d\n\u201cFang, that\u2019s not...wait. Please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d My eyes bug out at the idea that Naser even thought this was a possibility. Actually\u2026\nI glance over to Fang-Anon, and he\u2019s wildly shaking his head, doing a cut-throat motion, and mouthing \u2018no\u2019 over and over again. Okay, bad idea, got it.\n\u201cNo, holy shit, Fa...I am not fucking pregnant, Naser.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cYES!\u201d \n\u201cAlright, alright, but what the hell am I going to tell dad?\u201d\n\u201cMan, I don\u2019t know...like...fucking...I think you need to see this for yourself.\u201d Fang-Anon bites back a scream, not happy with that conclusion. \n\u201cI...okay.\u201d\n\u201cJust promise me that you\u2019ll...keep an open mind, I guess?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that supposed- nevermind, I\u2019ll find out when I get there. See you in a bit. Bye.\u201d\n\u201cBye.\u201d The phone clicks, and the call ends.\n\u201cYou fucking idiot,\u201d Fang-Anon hisses.  \n\u201cThe fuck did you want me to do? Telling him to fuck off didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cNot bring him here!\u201d \n\u201cYou told me it was on me. You don\u2019t get to bitch about the outcome.\u201d \n\u201cHow the fuck are we going to possibly explain to him that we\u2019ve...fucking swapped bodies? I barely even believe it myself, and I\u2019m sitting here in your fucking body!\u201d\n\nI sit in my desk chair as Fang-Anon rapidly paces back and forth across the apartment. Volcadera Bluff was not a particularly massive town. It would not take Naser a very long time to get here. Time that I was wasting by thinking about the time I have left, rather than trying to figure out some sort of plan. Time that I was wasting thinking about wasting the time I have left thinking about the time I have left, rather than\u2026\n\u201cAnon, shut the fuck up. Please.\u201d Sorry. Guess I still mumble even as Fang.\n\u201cWe just need to...we just...need to\u2026\u201d His train of thought is interrupted by a knock on the door. \u201cFuck.\u201d He glances over to me. I guess the pleasure is all mine. I walk over to the door and open it, Fang-Anon leaning against a countertop a bit further away. Naser stands in the doorway, looking at me expectantly. My mind completely blanks on what I was planning on saying. Had I even figured out something to say in the first place?\n\u201cWell? What\u2019s so important that I had to come out here to hear it in person?\u201d \n\u201cI...uh...mm\u2026\u201d I struggle to make a coherent noise for a moment, and then Fang-Anon speaks up.\n\u201cAnon and I swapped bodies. It\u2019s as stupid as it sounds.\u201d Naser looks back to me.\n\u201cAlright, now what\u2019s the real reason?\u201d\n\u201cFang and I swapped bodies. It\u2019s...as stupid as it sounds.\u201d \n\u201cDid you really call me out here for some stupid prank, Fang?\u201d\n\u201c...\u201d Oh shit, he\u2019s talking to me. \u201cWait, no. Please, Naser. I\u2019m serious. It\u2019s the truth.\u201d I do my best to sound as sincere as possible. It wasn\u2019t difficult considering I\u2019m telling the truth after all, but I hope the extra effort I put into it helps. Naser looks confused, but unimpressed.\n\u201cAlright. Prove it.\u201d \n\u201cI...uh\u2026\u201d Think, Anon, think. What\u2019s something that Anon and Naser know that Fang wouldn\u2019t know?  Something so minor and inconsequential that I would never even bother telling her, if I had even remembered it in the first place? Come on\u2026\n\u201cRemember....remember\u2026remember...the first day of school! At lunch! I had one of those shitty school pizzas, and while we were talking it became inedible, and Naomi got you to split that sandwich with me. A philly cheesesteak. Holy fuck, it was good too. Remember?\u201d\n\u201cI...yeah. I do remember that, actually. But...well\u2026\u201d Fang-Anon clears his throat, and we turn to look at him.\n\u201cStephen Ha-wing, Helen Fly-er, Peter Wing-lage\u2026\u201d He rattles off a half-dozen other disabled celebrity wing-puns without skipping a beat. \u201cNeed I go on?\u201d he concludes, smirking. Naser looks on in awe as what used to be my mouth says things only Fang had ever dared to say. He looks back between Fang-Anon and I multiple times, his eyes and mouth wider with every go-between. \n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026\u201d he says, to nobody in particular. \u201cSo, you\u2019re Anon?\u201d he asks, looking at me. I nod. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Fang?\u201d he asks Fang-Anon, who also nods. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d \n\u201cDo you believe us now?\u201d I ask pleadingly. \n\u201cI...what choice do I have? Only Fang would be able to say any of that so easily and so swiftly. How long is this going to go on?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. Might be tomorrow. Might be next week. Might be never. Hopefully not never, there are definitely certain parts of me that I like and will be sorely missing very soon.\u201d\n\u201cHah! He misses his dick already,\u201d Fang-Anon teases.\n\u201cYou shut your mouth, you can\u2019t possibly understand what I\u2019m going through.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Naser interrupts. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go, you two...nevermind I\u2019m not even gonna think about that one. I\u2019ll figure something out. Let me know if you\u2019re better by tomorrow, I guess.\u201d Naser turns around and heads towards the stairwell and out of sight. I close the door, relieved. \nWe return to the main room and before I can even start mulling over what to do next, Fang-Anon wraps his arms around me again. \n\u201cSo I guess we have carte blanche to do whatever we want now, huh?\u201d He wonders aloud. My blush returns in full force.\n\u201cFang, I dunno...this is kinda weird.\u201d \n\u201cCome on, think about it. This is a chance to truly understand each other\u2019s bodies like nobody else possibly could.\u201d If I had any doubts on what he was implying before, they were gone now. \n\u201cThis is really weird, Fang\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still your girlfriend, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t so insecure about your sexuality that you\u2019ll say no to your own girlfriend, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n\u201cI think offering to fuck me with my own dick is a little farther than most people have to deal with.\u201d\n\u201cHey, you said it, not me.\u201d Fuck. \u201cBesides\u2026\u201d He leans in, chin on my shoulder again, and whispers in my ear, hole...thing. \u201cI know all my favorite spots.\u201d I blush so hard I begin to sweat. He chuckles, and I don\u2019t notice his hand slowly sliding up my torso until it\u2019s right below one of my new boobs. He plants his lips on my neck and a hand on my breast, squeezing ever so gently. I gasp from the small but unexpected jolt of pleasure.\n\u201cFang, I really don\u2019t know if I\u2019m comfortable with where this might go\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind when I hear you beg for it later.\u201d  Sweet Raptor Jesus I am so fucking fucked. \u201cHey, you said it, not me.\u201d I\u2019m still mumbling too, wonderful. He releases me and seats himself on the bed, looks at me seductively, then waggles his eyebrows while patting an open spot next to him. I take a moment to really soak in the complete insanity that I\u2019m looking at. I look down at the all black, low-cut and partially ripped shirt and pants adorning my body, the pale blue feathers covering the rest of me. This is who I am, for today at least. I look back up at myself, but it\u2019s not myself because it\u2019s actually my girlfriend, who\u2019s also my boyfriend, I think. This is who she is, for today at least. A couple of horny teenagers in the same room, thinking the same thing - albeit for different reasons - given one of the wildest and most fantastic opportunities imaginable. I take a deep breath and mentally steel myself. This was no time to back down.\nI take my place next to Fang-Anon and he scooches next to me, pulling me close. I wrap my arms around him just like I would do if things were normal. I\u2019m a bit smaller than normal, but I\u2019ll ignore that. I lean into his shoulder and he leans back against me. My nervous heart and fluttering stomach is a confusing bundle of emotions that I can\u2019t seem to still. \n\u201cWhy do you seem so comfortable with this?\u201d I ask. \u201cI\u2019m kinda freaking out over here and you\u2019re just...cool with it.\u201d\n\u201cHmm...you ever wonder what it would be like to be a girl? Like, before today, obviously?\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, not really. I kinda liked all my features where they were.\u201d\n\u201cAh, well. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a dino, most of the time anyway. Having to deal with estrus season every year gets...tiring. Spent a lot of time wondering if the grass was really greener on the other side; how nice it would supposedly be to spend some time relaxing during that time of the year for a change, rather than being a horny, hormonal mess. Trust me, being a reject like me during estrus season sucks all of the dicks. Not wanting to get into specifics, but it tends to amplify...everything. For better and for worse.\u201d \nDamn, that actually makes a lot of sense. My train of thought is interrupted by lips pressing against mine. The sensation is thankfully very familiar, considering the amount of kissing we\u2019ve done before on this very bed. My heart swells and the fluttering intensifies, but they are now united in purpose.\n*VHOOMF*\nI feel my wings quickly and roughly splay themselves open to their fullest extent, startling me off of the kiss. Fang-Anon opens his eyes and immediately bursts into laughter. I try to control the limbs with what little active knowledge I had of them, but get nothing in response. I reach over to forcefully push them around, but they resist my every attempted movement. \n\u201cI...Fang! Help! Wings! Stop laughing!\u201d He does not stop laughing. \n\u201cI can\u2019t...I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d He gasps for air as he doubles over, unable to finish a sentence. I do my best to look angry but just end up crossing my arms and pouting. \n\u201cI can\u2019t help you...they\u2019re stuck like that for a while...hehehe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhy? How come I\u2019ve never seen this before?\u201d \n\u201cWinged dinos learn to suppress that reflex early on cause it\u2019s embarrassing. Guess it didn\u2019t work for you, so you\u2019re stuck with a wingboner for...all day, probably.\u201d\n\u201cIt lasts a whole fucking day?!\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I\u2019m not going to give you enough time to calm it down.\u201d Before I can respond, he grabs me and pulls me into another kiss. I feel his tongue flick across my lips, and I gingerly tilt my head and open my mouth. I have a general idea of what to do, but to actually emulate it with this weird reptilian tongue is another matter entirely. Fang-Anon\u2019s tongue wastes no time barging into my mouth while I\u2019m busy trying to figure out how to use my own. Mine tentatively meets his, and an awkward dance of quasi-virgin tongue-kissing commences. It doesn\u2019t take me long to figure out that my tongue is long and dextrous enough that it can actually wrap around his completely. The sensation is certainly interesting from my end, and when he yanks me closer, hot breath washing over my snout as he hungrily searches for more, it confirms that he very much likes it. \nFang-Anon breaks away and we stare into each other\u2019s eyes, panting heavily as a thin, transparent string of saliva connects us for a moment longer before falling and breaking. For the first time today, I notice a consistent and repetitive \u2018whap\u2019 right behind me. I struggle to tear myself away from Fang-Anon\u2019s eyes to take a peek behind me, and see my tail going completely haywire against the mattress. Did dinos usually have this little control over their own body? Wings splayed taut, tail frantically beating, heart racing, breath heavy, knees weak, arms heavy, and it apparently gets worse when they get into season? \nAn arm grabs mine and pulls me over, and I fall on top of Anon.\n\u201cHush, dweeb,\u201d he whispers. I take the advice, wrapping my arms around his neck and pressing my head into his chest, listening to his heartbeat. \u201cLet me show you something.\u201d Fingers start tracing circles in the bare feathers on my lower back, just above my waist. I relax even further, our legs entangling and my waist resting against his. The fingers crawl up my back and past my shirt, and stop around where my wings are connected. Two pairs of fingers rest on a bit of muscle in between the wing connections and my shoulders, and another two pairs rest just underneath the connections. This is nice and all, but he\u2019s not really doing...anything\u2026\n\u201cSo, uh, is this-\u201d As if he was waiting for me to speak up, the fingers gently press into me. All at once almost every muscle in my body tenses, then goes limp and I melt into Anon\u2019s embrace. Even my wings relax ever so slightly, just enough to lazily flap in blissful response to the finger massage. They press and rub against me, randomly changing pressure and position so that one spot is never feeling quite the same as another. I close my eyes, diverting all my mental power towards experiencing this as much as I can possibly manage. I wordlessly moan as he continues, planting barely-registered kisses on my snout and face. My tongue lolls out of my mouth as I pant like an animal, putty in Anon\u2019s hands. \nIt takes me a minute to realize that Anon had stopped at some point, and another to recover enough motor control to shift myself over, looking at him head-on from on top of him. I don\u2019t speak, but he knows what I\u2019m thinking.\n\u201cI hope you were paying attention. That will be on the test. As will this\u2026\u201d He plants his hands on my waist, shifting me around a bit until he finds a spot he\u2019s satisfied with. He leans over a bit, looking past me, and then swiftly catches my tail that was - up until that moment - still wagging. I settle my front half back into him as he gently rubs my tail, occasionally flicking the tip of it with his thumb. This is interesting and all, but...wait, I\u2019ve thought this before...\n\u201cSo, uh, is this-!\u201d Anon interrupts by roughly slapping my ass, causing me to yelp and push myself up. I glare at him and he smirks in response. \n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it,\u201d he says, cackling. Jackass. He responds by getting a handful of my ass in both hands and squeezing hard, his fingers reaching towards my inner thighs and his thumbs pressing against the base of my tail. My wings flare again and I collapse back onto him as his fingers prod and spread as much as my skin-tight jeans allow, much more aroused than I was seconds before. \n\u201cWow, these really do get in the way, huh?\u201d he comments. Before I can even grunt questionably, a button just above my tail clicks open, the fabric loosing its grip on my waist ever so slightly. His fingers wriggle into the new gap, slowly sliding my pants past my hips. His hands return to their resting spots on my ass, now separated only by thin black panties and our waning restraint. At this point I\u2019m content to let him do whatever he wants. I\u2019d get my turn eventually. Probably. \nHe flips us onto our sides, and I wrap my arms and my free leg around him, desperate to pull him as close as possible. Our lips meet as one of his hands gently squeezes my ass, my leg pulling his waist towards me. I experience an abject clarity, as if Raptor Jesus had opened up the secrets of the universe to me for just long enough to make an extremely important revelation. In this moment, I am Fang, and not Anon. It is Anon that is laying with me, and not Fang. Which means that the strange bump currently pressing into my crotch is not just any random muscle, but in fact, Anon\u2019s penis. I break away from the kiss to gather my breath and reveal my findings to Anon. Before I can start, he grabs my waist and forcefully thrusts into me, that lump of flesh grinding against something very sensitive, and my findings come out as a garbled gasp. \nHe didn\u2019t bother with any snarky comments this time around, electing to simply suckle on my neck and worm one of his hands under my shirt and onto my breast while grinding his waist into mine. \n\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d I moan. Anon hikes up my shirt and dives right in, taking one of my nipples into his mouth and sucking hard on it. Is this all just primal horniness, or are these Fang\u2019s fantasies made manifest? \n\u201cTold you I know all my favorite spots,\u201d Anon backs off for a moment to speak, then returns to tongue-bathing my milkers. I really need to stop blasting all my thoughts into the open.\n\u201cIt\u2019s way worse today, is it the horniness or the confusion?\u201d For fucks sake shut up holy shit.\nAnon chuckles and turns me on my back, lifting himself above me. My wings protest but some shifting convinces them to spread sideways around my shoulders rather than outwards. He starts planting kisses on me, starting from my neck and slowly making his way down my chest, gingerly kissing around my navel multiple times before sliding down in between my thighs. He lovingly caresses them as if they were sacred idols, and I moan in anticipation. He's inches away from the most sensitive parts of my body, his tongue flirting with the idea of exactly what I need. He looks up at me, eyes half-open, hot breath washing over my panties, which I'm just now noticing are damp from something that definitely isn't sweat. Then he...then he...oh shit. I clamp my mouth shut before any more of my inner thoughts can escape. His eyes narrow and his smirk widens, the rest of him completely still except for his breathing. \n\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d The smugness in his tone is revolting, and I just know these next few minutes are going to be pure agony. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing a lot here, and not getting much back.\u201d Every word is directed straight into my crotch, my teeth clenching as I latch onto the sheets in a desperate attempt to keep quiet. \u201cHell, I\u2019m still fully clothed, and you\u2019re just sitting back and letting me do all the work.\u201d Don\u2019t fucking say anything, don\u2019t give in, it\u2019s what he wants. \u201cEven now, you\u2019re just kinda laying there. Sure, I could dive right into your ptero pussy right now, drive you absolutely wild beyond anything you could imagine. I know all my favorite spots, after all.\u201d Please just stop fucking talking, I will never live this down if I falter now. \u201cBut what would I get out of it? Playing Ringer Rock or whatever would probably be more fun\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Rock Ring!\u201d The words force themselves out of me, and I grab my snout to hold it shut. \n\u201cOh, you\u2019re right, my memory must be hazy. There might be some other things I forgot, I think I\u2019m gonna go jog my memory.\u201d I scream into my closed snout as his cheek brushes against my thigh. \u201cHm, you say something?\u201d My nostrils flare as I fail to calm myself down, my arousal and irritation and anticipation all mixing and swirling and begging to be expressed. Please for the sweet love of Raptor Jesus eating my fucking ptero pussy you goddamn son of a bitch. The words bounce around the inside of my mouth, only sputters and incoherent noises escaping. \n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to speak up, Fang. Is there something you want?\u201d \n\u201cPLEASE!\u201d I scream to the heavens to deliver me from this fucking bullshit. \n\u201cPlease, what?\u201d The heavens have forsaken me. There is no God here. Only Anon.\n\u201cPlease eat my fucking ptero pussy you stupid fucking-!\u201d The rest of my sentence is devoured by a loud, ecstatic moan that would be embarrassing if I gave the remotest shit about anything else right now. Anon yanks my panties to the side and I practically explode as he smothers his face with my nethers. I reflexively grab his head and press it further into me, his tongue lapping at all sorts of immensely pleasurable spots that I really hope I can remember after this is all said and done. \n\u201cHoly fuck!\u201d I have no control of my voice and I have no desire to control it. His tongue wriggles against me and slips inside.\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d My hips buck against his face as his tongue attacks what\u2019s inside while his lips attack what\u2019s outside. I moan somebody\u2019s name, but I\u2019m not sure whose. I writhe uncontrollably under his relentless assault, not a single lick or suck or flick is wasted somewhere that wouldn\u2019t provide maximum results. I drop words entirely, ecstatically moaning and groaning in between every rapid breath. Even my horniest jack-off session couldn\u2019t hold a candle to this. Pressure and pleasure builds up to an apex, and one final suckle on the most sensitive part of my body sends me screaming over the edge.\n\u201cSKREE-ONK!\u201d \nMy arousal immediately turns to horror as the least-sexy noise I have ever heard comes out of my snout and lingers painfully in the air. My breath gradually slows, any potential afterglow completely erased as I stare at the ceiling. I don\u2019t dare look down, for I know Anon\u2019s expression would kill me on the spot. I don\u2019t dare speak, for I know Anon\u2019s response would kill me on the spot.\nI feel him crawl up, gently settling down on top of me and nuzzling my neck. \n\u201cYou know, I think that was actually kinda hot\u2026\u201d he murmurs. \n\u201cR-really?\u201d \n\u201cNo.\u201d \n\u201cFuck you...\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure to give you a couple more before we\u2019re done.\u201d\n\u201cA couple?\u201d\n\u201cDozen. You can\u2019t possibly fuck them all up. But before that...\u201d He sits up, shifting forward and onto his knees, putting his crotch directly in front of my face. \u201cI think I need a bit of a break.\u201d \nI figured it would have come to this eventually, but to actually be faced with the beast itself was an entirely different matter. I could see it straining against his pants, begging to finally be set free. I could probably get back at him\u2026\n\u201cDon\u2019t even bother. Quit stalling.\u201d I tentatively place a hand on his thigh, my thumb lightly brushing against the edge of the bulge. I feel something strange stir within me, and the idea of coming face to face with my own cock and balls suddenly doesn\u2019t seem all that bad. In fact, it was actually kind of exciting. Both of my hands pressed against the bulge, two of my fingers navigating the buckle and popping it open. His pants slacked and dropped a few inches, the top of his cock outlined against the elastic band of his boxers. He yanks his pants down the rest of the way, the entire length revealed against the thin layer of fabric. I can feel my eyes dilating, my breath quickening, my tail wapping, my wings splaying, like that ruined orgasm had never even happened. My hesitation is gone in an instant, and I yank his boxers off, and his dick\u2019s first act of freedom is to fall out and hit me straight on the snout. I barely register the impact and Anon\u2019s chuckle, taking it into my hand and- holy fuck was it always this big?\n\u201cYeah, I really don\u2019t know how you lug this thing around all day.\u201d I don\u2019t acknowledge the response to what was supposed to be contained within my mind, and I bring a second hand in to assist the first. It didn\u2019t make it look any smaller or easier to deal with.     My mouth waters, dangling open as my hands slide up towards the top, then pull down, revealing his glistening dick head.\n\u201cWatch the teeth.\u201d I\u2019ll have to ask him about the telepathy thing later. I slide his cock into my mouth, already well lubricated with my saliva. Further and further along my tongue it goes, finally stopping at my cheeks. \n\u201cHoh, shit\u2026\u201d At least that shut him up. I glance up and we make eye contact. For once, he doesn\u2019t look smug or like he\u2019s about to crack some stupid joke. I know all my favorite spots, too. And with some effort, this tongue could work wonders. I pull backwards to flick the tip with the tip of my tongue and suck on the edges of the head. His entire body twitches and he moans in delight, his cock throbbing against the sides of my mouth as I slide forwards again, wrapping my tongue around the entire girth. I settle into a relaxing rhythm, every suckle eliciting a pleasured grunt and every interesting tongue maneuver earning a mirthful moan. \nAnon gasps, grasping my crest and coaxing me backwards. I give one last hard suck as his cock pops out of my mouth, covered shaft to head with my spit. He unbuttons his shirt and takes it off, tossing it to the side. Fuck, did I always look this good? He doesn\u2019t say anything, scooting backwards and falling onto me, his dick landing right on my mound with a \u2018plap\u2019 as he nuzzles my neck. His hands trace paths up my arms, meeting my own, and our fingers interlock. He shifts his hips, the head of his dick pressing against my opening. No teasing, no bullying, no smug comments; he thrusts, flesh parting and caressing the new guest as we moan together. Euphoria floods me, and all at once every emotion I had tended to washes away, and every concern and fear I had been harboring vanishes.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what that feels like,\u201d we murmur in unison. He pulls almost all the way out, then slams it back in to the hilt, a shockwave of pleasure blasting over me. Another slam and another shockwave, over and over again. I wrap my arms and legs around him, pulling him as far into me as possible. My wings join in, a feathery blanket brushing against his back. He adapts to my leg-lock, shifting gears to shorter, faster thrusts. My eyes roll into the back of my head, a guttural moan of lust and pleasure collapsing from my snout as he jackhammers my pussy. He stops at the height of a thrust, on the precipice of ecstasy.\n\u201cGO!\u201d I scream in pure desperation. He slams his entire body into me, screaming into the pillow as his final thrust starts the chain reaction, a tsunami of orgasmic relief crashing against me as Anon\u2019s seed fills me, finally sating my primal instinct-driven desires. Sweet afterglow takes us.  He smothers me against the bed, his scent intoxicates me, his tongue makes love to my neck as I rub his back. Our breathing synchronizes, and for a brief moment, we become as one. \n\u201cI love you, Anon.\u201d The most beautiful words I\u2019ve ever heard flow across me like the finest silk, making everything feel a thousand times better than they just were.\n\u201cI love you too, Fang.\u201d The most satisfying words I\u2019ve ever spoken fill the air like a blissful song, making everything feel another thousand times better than they just were. We lie in each other\u2019s embrace, closer than any other couple on earth possibly could be. \n\u201cSo...round two?\u201d ","Title":"Fang\/Anon Bodyswap Alternate","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Naser and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-off","Author":"SurpriseVisitor","Summary":"Anon wakes up in Fang's body and Fang wakes up in Anon's.

Fang takes the opportunity to pull a prank that would normally be impossible. \n\n\nI scrunch my face and stretch my limbs as the final afterthoughts of some bizarre dream involving sprouting wings and flying fade into the background of my mind. A breathy groan escapes me as I blink the sleep from my eyes, sitting up straight in my bed. I stretch again, raising my arms high into the air, and a familiar \u2018vhwoomp\u2019 of feathery wings unfurling sounds from behind me. I look over to my beautiful pterodactyl girlfriend laying beside me, and I do not see my beautiful pterodactyl girlfriend laying beside me. I see a bald human laying beside me. A dashingly handsome bald human, but a bald human my pterodactyl girlfriend is not. \nWhere is my pterodactyl girlfriend? A panicked scream threatens to emerge from me, but I force it down with some effort. This is just another one of Fang\u2019s pranks. Screaming means I lose. I chuckle to myself, having narrowly avoided an embarrassing defeat. I start to reach over to the human costume, but hesitate. What if it\u2019s just a mannequin? I can\u2019t counter-prank a mannequin, I\u2019d look like an idiot for trying. I look closer, and see the rising and falling of its sides. We\u2019re in the clear, counter-prank is a go.\nI reach over towards Fang in a human costume, my pale blue arm and black claws hovering inches from them. Why was my arm pale blue? Why did I have black claws? I pull my hand back and thoroughly inspect it, flexing the fingers and poking the tips of the claws. It\u2019s definitely my hand, but it\u2019s not a hand I remember having. I glance at the pair of angelic wings on full display behind me. I brush the hand through its feathers, feeling the fingers trace through it\u2019s folds. My fingers. On my wings. The wings lightly flap once, the previously unknown joints and muscles feeling distressingly normal. I look down at my black top and...oh my fucking God.\nI tear myself out from under the covers and rush into the bathroom and to the mirror. A panic-stricken Fang looks back at me from inside the mirror. I raise a hand to my face and the Fang inside the mirror does the same. I run my hand across my gargantuan snout and the Fang inside the mirror does the same. I press my hand against the mirror and the Fang inside the mirror does the same. There is no Fang inside the mirror. Just me.\nThe urge to scream fills me a second time, but I force it down again. There\u2019s no need to panic, this is just a dream. A weird, incredibly lucid dream. A weird, incredibly lucid dream where I can physically control limbs and feel body parts that I\u2019ve never had before and would have no possible frame of reference for. Just a dream. I look down again at my black top and\u2026oh my fucking God.\n\u201cAnon!\u201d A scared, confused and distinctly masculine voice calls from the other room. \n\u201cYeah?\u201d A scared, confused and distinctly feminine voice responds from my mouth. Feet hit the floor and rush over to the bathroom door, that dashingly handsome human from before throwing the door open. It\u2019s like I\u2019m looking into a mirror, but that can't be the case because the mirror is on the wall to my right, not panting in the middle of the bathroom in front of me. He slides over next to me, gripping the sinktop and staring into the mirror along with me. We stare together, at each other but not at each other because we were each other and not ourselves. I think.\n\u201cI\u2019m dreaming, right?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m dreaming,\u201d I respond. No, wait, that\u2019s my voice, but not my words. \n\u201cWhat? No. How can you be dreaming if I\u2019m dreaming?\u201d I rebut. We looked at each other like the other one of us was an idiot. \n\u201cFine then, pinch me,\u201d I- he demands.\n\u201cWhat? No, you pinch me,\u201d I counter. We stare at each other, unmoving and unwilling.\n\u201cWhat if we\u2019re both dreaming?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d \n\u201cDoes any of this make any sense?\u201d I wildly gesture to myself. He grumbles in response. We return to inspecting ourselves in the mirror, hands brushing across our new features. Snout, crest, tail, weird elbow feathers, and...oh my fucking God.\n\u2026\nI have boobs. And not disgusting man titties either; actual, female breasts. Modest breasts, but breasts nonetheless. I bring a hand to my chest, only to have it swatted away by Fang\u2019s- no, Anon\u2019s- no, Fang-Anon\u2019s hand.\n\u201cDon\u2019t play with my boobs, you fucking perv,\u201d he demands.\n\u201cOh, now it\u2019s a problem? You weren\u2019t saying that...hey, wait. These aren\u2019t even fucking yours! They\u2019re mine!\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t care, we\u2019re not doing this shit. Would you want me to start playing with your dick right now?\u201d Before I can deploy a cheeky response, the phone in my pocket buzzes. \n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Fang says quietly. With my voice. \u201cThat\u2019s gotta be Naser. He\u2019s gonna want me back today. He\u2019s gonna want you back today.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well that..oh...fuck.\u201d The realization dawns on me far later than it should have. I pull the phone out and turn the screen on, blankly staring at the password screen for a moment.\n\u201cFour ones,\u201d Fang comments. I input the password I definitely didn\u2019t know before just now and a notification pops up on the screen. Naser did in fact want Fang back later today. \n\u201cUh, what are you gonna tell him?\u201d I ask tentatively. \n\u201cWhat am I gonna tell him? What are you gonna tell him? You\u2019re Fang.\u201d \n\u201cWhoa whoa whoa, no, no no no, I did not sign up for this shit. He\u2019s still your brother. You are not sending me back with your brother, to your house, with your parents. That is a disaster waiting to happen.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d \n\u201cI wake up in your bed as me, your dad turns my skull into an impromptu golf ball, and the rest of me is buried in six different counties.\u201d \n\u201cAlright, alright, whatever. We gotta come up with something, cause I don\u2019t think Naser or dad are gonna take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer this time around.\u201d \n\u201cWell...what would you normally do in this situation?\u201d\n\u201cTell Naser to fuck off, and hope he does.\u201d Fuck it, guess I\u2019ll give it a shot.\nI open the messenger app, navigate to Naser\u2019s entry and begin typing out a message.\n\u2018Any chance we could move that to tomorrow? Some stuff has kinda come up.\u2019 Almost immediately, a symbol indicating Naser\u2019s incoming response appears.\n\u2018What kind of stuff?\u2019 \n\u2018Important stuff.\u2019 A few seconds pass without an indication of a message being prepared, then the phone starts buzzing wildly. Naser was not content with text and is calling me directly. \n\u201cIt\u2019s all you now, Anon. Fang. You.\u201d Fang-Anon\u2019s voice did not calm me one bit. I swipe the answer icon, and put the phone to my ear-hole...thing. \n\u201cFang? Is everything alright?\u201d Naser\u2019s concern for both himself and me were obvious.\n\u201cYup! All good here!\u201d I hope my anxiety wasn\u2019t obvious in my voice.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Naser\u2019s voice lowers and he whispers through the phone. \u201cDo you need me to call the cops?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, no. I promise, it\u2019s alright.\u201d\n\u201cThen what\u2019s so important?\u201d\n\u201cI...well...you see\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou know dad\u2019s not going to take any old excuse, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know, it\u2019s just...uh\u2026you know, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d believe me if I told you.\u201d\n\u201cFang, that\u2019s not...wait. Please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d My eyes bug out at the idea that Naser even thought this was a possibility. Actually\u2026\nI glance over to Fang-Anon, and he\u2019s wildly shaking his head, doing a cut-throat motion, and mouthing \u2018no\u2019 over and over again. Okay, bad idea, got it.\n\u201cNo, holy shit, Fa...I am not fucking pregnant, Naser.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cYES!\u201d \n\u201cAlright, alright, but what the hell am I going to tell dad?\u201d\n\u201cMan, I don\u2019t know...like...fucking...I think you need to see this for yourself.\u201d Fang-Anon bites back a scream, not happy with that conclusion. \n\u201cI...okay.\u201d\n\u201cJust promise me that you\u2019ll...keep an open mind, I guess?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that supposed- nevermind, I\u2019ll find out when I get there. See you in a bit. Bye.\u201d\n\u201cBye.\u201d The phone clicks, and the call ends.\n\u201cYou fucking idiot,\u201d Fang-Anon hisses.  \n\u201cThe fuck did you want me to do? Telling him to fuck off didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cNot bring him here!\u201d \n\u201cYou told me it was on me. You don\u2019t get to bitch about the outcome.\u201d \n\u201cHow the fuck are we going to possibly explain to him that we\u2019ve...fucking swapped bodies? I barely even believe it myself, and I\u2019m sitting here in your fucking body! Are we sure we aren\u2019t actually dreaming?\u201d \nFang-Anon roughly slaps me on the back, and I yelp pathetically. I swear and reflexively jab my elbow into his side. \n\u201cAgh. Okay, not dreaming, I guess. Fuck,\u201d he whines. \n\nI sit in my desk chair as Fang-Anon rapidly paces back and forth across the apartment. Volcadera Bluff was not a particularly massive town. It would not take Naser a very long time to get here. Time that I was wasting by thinking about the time I have left, rather than trying to figure out some sort of plan. Time that I was wasting thinking about wasting the time I have left thinking about the time I have left, rather than\u2026\n\u201cAnon, shut the fuck up. Please.\u201d Sorry. Guess I still mumble even as Fang.\n\u201cWe just need to...we just...need to\u2026\u201d His train of thought is interrupted by a knock on the door. \u201cFuck.\u201d He glances over to me. I guess the pleasure is all mine. I walk over to the door and open it, Fang-Anon leaning against a countertop a bit further away. Naser stands in the doorway, looking at me expectantly. My mind completely blanks on what I was planning on saying. Had I even figured out something to say in the first place?\n\u201cWell? What\u2019s so important that I had to come out here to hear it in person?\u201d \n\u201cI...uh...mm\u2026\u201d I struggle to make a coherent noise for a moment, and then Fang-Anon speaks up.\n\u201cAnon and I swapped bodies. It\u2019s as stupid as it sounds.\u201d Naser looks back to me.\n\u201cAlright, now what\u2019s the real reason?\u201d\n\u201cFang and I swapped bodies. It\u2019s...as stupid as it sounds.\u201d \n\u201cDid you really call me out here for some stupid prank, Fang?\u201d\n\u201c...\u201d Oh shit, he\u2019s talking to me. \u201cWait, no. Please, Naser. I\u2019m serious. It\u2019s the truth.\u201d I do my best to sound as sincere as possible. It wasn\u2019t difficult considering I\u2019m telling the truth after all, but I hope the extra effort I put into it helps. Naser looks confused, but unimpressed.\n\u201cAlright. Prove it.\u201d \n\u201cI...uh\u2026\u201d Think, Anon, think. What\u2019s something that Anon and Naser know that Fang wouldn\u2019t know?  Something so minor and inconsequential that I would never even bother telling her, if I had even remembered it in the first place? Come on\u2026\n\u201cRemember....remember\u2026remember...the first day of school! At lunch! I had one of those shitty school pizzas, and while we were talking it became inedible, and Naomi got you to split that sandwich with me. A philly cheesesteak. Holy fuck, it was good too. Remember?\u201d\n\u201cI...yeah. I do remember that, actually. But...well\u2026\u201d Fang-Anon clears his throat, and we turn to look at him.\n\u201cStephen Ha-wing, Helen Fly-er, Peter Wing-lage\u2026\u201d He rattles off a half-dozen other disabled celebrity wing-puns without skipping a beat. \u201cNeed I go on?\u201d he concludes, smirking. Naser looks on in awe as what used to be my mouth says things only Fang had ever dared to say. He looks back between Fang-Anon and I multiple times, his eyes and mouth wider with every go-between. \n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026\u201d he says, to nobody in particular. \u201cSo, you\u2019re Anon?\u201d he asks, looking at me. I nod. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Fang?\u201d he asks Fang-Anon, who also nods. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d \n\u201cDo you believe us now?\u201d I ask pleadingly. \n\u201cI...what choice do I have? Only Fang would be able to say any of that so easily and so swiftly. How long is this going to go on?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. Might be tomorrow. Might be next week. Might be never. Hopefully not never, there are definitely certain parts of me that I like and will be sorely missing very soon.\u201d\n\u201cHah! He misses his dick already,\u201d Fang-Anon teases.\n\u201cYou shut your mouth, you can\u2019t possibly understand what I\u2019m going through.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Naser interrupts. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go, you two...nevermind I\u2019m not even gonna think about that one. I\u2019ll figure something out. Let me know if you\u2019re better by tomorrow, I guess.\u201d Naser turns around and heads towards the stairwell and out of sight. I close the door, relieved. \nWe return to the main room and I take a seat on the edge of the bed, mulling what to do next. I glance at the clock - it\u2019s barely been half an hour since we woke up. I break the silence.\n\u201cSo I guess we have carte blanche to do whatever we want now, huh?\u201d \n\u201cYup, I guess so. Wait. Fuck! I totally promised Trish and Reed that I\u2019d hang out with them today.\u201d \n\u201cI thought you were taking a break from the band?\u201d\n\u201cI am, but this isn\u2019t a band thing, just friend stuff. What the fuck are you going to do?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you invited yourself to that?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going by myself.\u201d Fang-Anon falls backwards into my desk chair with a grunt, rubbing his brow. He clenches his eyes shut and lets out a long \u2018hmmm\u2019 as he lightly rocks in the chair, at least as much as it would allow. A corner of his lip curves upwards, turning into a smirk, and then into a full-on shit-eating grin. He opens his eyes and looks straight at me.\n\u201cFang, no. I\u2019m not going. I can\u2019t, too much could go wrong.\u201d\n\u201cI know. You won\u2019t be going. We will be, though. Hand me your phone. My phone.\u201d I lean over and pass the phone, and he starts rapidly typing out messages. A few minutes of tapping and buzzing later, he looks up satisfied, that shit-eating grin still painting his face.\n\u201cFang, I know they\u2019re our friends, but do they really need to know about all this?\u201d\n\u201cNope, and we\u2019re not going to tell them.\u201d I fail to respond with words and instead opt for a desperate, confused grunt. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the details, this hinges on you not knowing anything. Just keep it cool. Also, if you tell them, you\u2019ll be a Supreme Loser and an Absolute Ruiner of Fun.\u201d The threat takes me aback. Such titles were reserved only for someone who purposefully fucks up a grand prank. Whatever they have in store, it\u2019s going to be good. \n\n A few hours later outside of our apartment building, I clamber into Reed\u2019s white van.\n\u201cFang! Hi!\u201d Trish excitedly shouts at me over the clatter of the engine from the passenger seat, waving wildly. That\u2019s directed at me, come on, I practiced this.\n\u201cHeya Trish, Reed,\u201d I respond, taking one of the seats in the back. Smooth. Fang-Anon climbs in right after.\n\u201cSup ladies, sup Trish.\u201d The greeting is clearly designed to piss Trish off as much as possible, and Trish\u2019s face morphs from excitement to fury in a split second.\n\u201cF- Anon, behave,\u201d I snap, lightly punching him on the shoulder. Man, it feels weird to chastise myself from outside of myself like that.\n\u201cDid you really need to bring him?\u201d Trish whines. \u201cI know he\u2019s your boyfriend and everything, but I\u2019m already regretting it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Trish,\u201d I respond, not really knowing what to say. I don\u2019t even know why we\u2019re doing this, although I suspect it\u2019s to mess with Trish.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, Trish,\u201d Reed speaks up from the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cBesides, maybe if you stopped getting so angry all the time, Anon\u2019d stop fuckin\u2019 with you.\u201d Trish just loudly groans in response, slumping back into her seat and muttering something about skinnies.\nThe van picks up and starts its journey. Fang-Anon had filled me in on some of the details. We were going to some cheap but decent restaurant with outdoor dining, on one of the few mid-April afternoons that it wasn\u2019t supposed to rain and that it wasn\u2019t cold as balls. Outside of that, I had absolutely no idea to expect, outside of Trish being the butt of whatever Fang-Anon was planning. I just have to play along and make sure not to reveal today\u2019s strange twist of events. I\u2019m a little conflicted about the entire idea, at least what little of it I could guess at. Extracting a genuine apology from Trish over the auditorium incident had been...difficult. If Fang-Anon went too far with this prank just to get back at her for that, it could complicate things. Granted that that is what this is all about, anyway. \n\nWe eventually arrive at the quaint establishment, seat ourselves and order some food. I mentally thank the fact that Fang is carnivorous, cause if I had to go veggie-only I would\u2019ve lost it. \n\u201cSo, Fang! How\u2019s it been,\u201d Trish asks me.\n\u201cBeen pretty good, if I say so myself,\u201d Fang-Anon responds before I even open my mouth. Trish glares at him with barely-restrained rage.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you, you fucking idiot.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shit, my bad. Don\u2019t know what got into me there. Fang?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah, it\u2019s been nice. Can\u2019t complain,\u201d I answer. Trish\u2019s seething subsides slightly, and she relaxes in her chair a little. \u201cBut you,\u201d I say, turning to Fang-Anon and poking him in the side. \u201cIs your name Fang?\u201d \n\u201cDepends on which part of me you ask,\u201d he says, smug that such a bizarre statement is completely lost on Trish and Reed. \n\u201cWhatever, dweeb.\u201d I giggle internally at my response. \u201cQuit trying to mess with Trish.\u201d \n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not trying to. I guess being a barbaric monster hellbent on corrupting the innocent just comes naturally to me.\u201d What the actual fuck was that supposed to mean? I raise an eyebrow at him, then look over at Reed and Trish. He looks a little confused but shrugs it off and she\u2019s frozen in place, completely mortified at what sounded like complete nonsense. \n\u201cW-what did you just say?\u201d Trish stutters. \n\u201cHm? Nothing, just I guess I can be a bit of an asshole sometimes. Sorry.\u201d Trish shakes her head and attempts to calm herself.\n\u201cY-yeah, you need to, you know... work on that.\u201d \n\u201cYou alright, Trish? You look kinda pale.\u201d \n\u201cWhat? Me? No, I just, uh...I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d Trish pushes herself away from the table and hurries off into the building, probably in search of a bathroom. A minute later, my pocket buzzes and a message from Trish shows up on it.\n\u2018what did u tell him???\u2019\nI could only guess as to what on earth this could possibly mean, which meant it probably had something to do with whatever Fang\u2019s plan is. I type out a response.\n\u2018Nothing? Is everything alright?\u2019\n\u2018did u hear what he said?\u2019\n\u2018Yeah, what about it?\u2019\n\u2018what about it?? how could he know to say that unless u told him?\u2019\n\u2018It was probably just a weird coincidence. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much, I haven\u2019t said anything I shouldn\u2019t have.\u2019 A blind shot in the dark, but I had to reel Trish back into this somehow. Plus, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m lying. I\u2019m just as clueless as she is. \n\u2018k\u2019\n\u201cYo\u2026\u201d Reed perks up leaning into the table and eying us suspiciously. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you two?\u201d I tilt my head at him. \u201cYour...your vibes are off. Both of you.\u201d I glance over to Fang-Anon. Does Reed somehow know?\n\u201cReed, I\u2019ll tell you two at school on Monday. Don\u2019t mention it until then, especially to Trish,\u201d Fang-Anon whispers across the table. Reed stares back contemplatively. \n\u201cYeah, alright.\u201d He leans back into his chair and relaxes.\nSoon enough Trish returns to the table and our food arrives. I look at the hot dog in front of me, stacked high with sauces and toppings. Man, they made a mean looking dog. I pick it up and move it towards my gigantic snout. Oh fuck, how do I eat with this gigantic snout? \n\u201cHey, Fang. I\u2019ll give you five bucks if you swallow that in one bite,\u201d Fang-Anon challenges.\n\u201cWhat? No, that\u2019s retarded,\u201d I reply.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Scared of having a tube of delicious meat filling your delicate gullet?\u201d I stare him down, hot dog inches from the tip of my snout.\n\u201cDude, I\u2019m trying to savor my hot dog. Please shut up.\u201d I look over at Trish and once again one of Fang-Anon\u2019s weird statements has her shell-shocked. She recovers from this one a bit quicker than the last, but whatever it is, it\u2019s having an effect on her. \nWith difficulty, I navigate a bite of food into my mouth, the long rows of sharp teeth tearing through the meat and bread with ease. Holy fuck, it tasted as good as it looked too. I tear through the rest of the meal in short order, spurred along by the fact that I hadn't eaten yet today. \n\"Damn bro, you killed that thing,\" Reed comments. He was just finishing his own food, Fang-Anon still had half of his and Trish is only a few bites in. \n\"Yeah...oh fuck that was good. Who's idea was it to come here?\"\n\"Uh...yours?\" Oh, shit.\n\"Uh, yeah, goddamn right it was. Man, I'm smart. Shit, do they have ice cream here? I bet that's good too.\" As I'm ordering, it occurs to me that I don't actually know what kind of ice cream Fang likes. I go with vanilla just to be safe, if a little disappointing. \nMy dessert arrives and I scoop a spoonful of it into my mouth. I audibly moan, unable to help myself. Is everything here this good?\n\"Damn Fang, desperate to have your insides filled with that creamy goodness or something?\" I do my best to ignore the distressingly suggestive comment from Fang-Anon, but Trish doesn't. She clamps her mouth shut and stifles a loud, panicked scream. \n\"Whoa, Trish, everything alright?\" I ask, before Fang-Anon says something to make the situation worse. \n\"Oh, everything is just fine with me. What's with you two though? You're acting really fucking weird. Right, Reed?\" she sputters, grinning fearfully and looking to Reed for any semblance of support. \n\"Hmm? Yeah, it's been pretty weird on all of us recently, hasn't it?\" Reed's non-answer does little to reassure Trish.\n\"No, that's not...UGH!\" She hides her head in her arms. \n\"Quit saying weird shit, we're trying to eat, dweeb,\" I tell Fang-Anon, ribbing him with my elbow. \u201cAnd quit doing...whatever you\u2019re doing to Trish. I thought you two were making nice after the auditorium shit.\u201d \n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Fang-Anon capitulates. \u201cSorry, Trish,\u201d he says, sneaking a bit of snark into his tone. Trish angrily murmurs something that could only be technically considered a response. \n\nThe rest of the day went by fairly uneventfully, Trish staying uncharacteristically quiet after that moment. The next morning I woke up, and looked at my hand. Skin and nails, not feathers and claws, thank goodness. It\u2019s Monday, so Fang and I got ready for school, and before I know it, it\u2019s lunch-time. Time for Fang\u2019s big reveal. We walk side by side to the auditorium, lunch in hand, and I push open the doors to see Trish and Reed already inside. Trish is stuck somewhere between panic and relief at seeing the both of us. She begins to protest, but Fang cuts her off.\n\u201cTrish, I gotta tell you something.\u201d They place their tray down and rush over to Trish\u2019s side, whispering into her ear, and Trish\u2019s expression starts rapidly changing. Relief. Confusion. Shock. Fear. Panic. Horror. She tries to respond, but more whispers interrupt her, and she can barely get a word out\n\u201cHuh? But-...wha-...how-...no-...\u201d Fang steps back, finished with their explanation, smugly observing Trish\u2019s inner turmoil. \n\u201cIt\u2019s me, Trish! It was me all along, Trish!\u201d They exclaim maniacally. \n\u201cWhat? No, that\u2019s not fucking possible! YOU!\u201d She points an accusatory finger at me. \u201cWhat do you know?!\u201d \n\u201cNothing, I swear! They\u2019re telling the truth! You can even ask Naser, he knows too.\u201d\n\u201cI...but...Reed! Fang is trying to say they swapped bodies with Anon, that\u2019s completely ridiculous. Right?\u201d\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Reed ponders aloud. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019d believe it. I saw their vibes were off yesterday, maybe they were actually swapped and I just didn\u2019t notice. \n\u201cWhat the fuck- their vibes?! Their fucking vibes?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sis. Their vibes. Way off yesterday, fine today.\u201d Trish frantically looks back and forth  between the three of us, eyes wide and clutching her bony crest.\n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Fang places a hand on Trish\u2019s shoulder. Her tone is soft, but her grin is borderline sadistic. \u201cNothing you do will ever be able to top that.

Anon sighed and put his hand over his hand over his face as she thrust herself out of her chair then fell sprawling onto her well-padded front and started to sob.\n\n\u201cGive me a hand with \u2018Goras, Reed?\u201d The two of them dragged the semi-conscious shortstack out the door and into the grimy lantern-lit street. While Reed sat on the gutter next to an incoherent Trish, Anon ducked back into the bar, spotting a familiar ptero crest. He circled around in front of her; back before the start of their tour he would have surprised her with a hug from behind, but these days she\u2019d probably stick her ka-bar through him.\n\nAs she spotted him those amber eyes lit up, and her brows raised in question. \u201c\u2018Goras and Reed are out the front,\u201d explained Anon, and Fang sighed and headed for the door. \u201cWhy do you call her \u2018Goras when she gets like this?\u201d she said. \u201cShort for Pythagoras,\u201d said Anon, \u201con account of all her triggernometry.\u201d Fang let out an involuntary burst of laughter, threw her hands in the air, and dug an elbow into his ribs as she walked past him and out into the alley. \u201cAt least I can get her some uppers in the morning,\u201d Reed muttered, stilling the shaking in his hands with a pull from a hip flask.\n\n~~~~\n\nLeave done, back on base, and one diminished and sunken-eyed trigga crew chief in tow, the four hurried towards their MedEvac Huey. Fang and Anon hoisted themselves into the cockpit while Reed and Trish swung up behind them into the cabin.\n\nFang began running through the preflight checklist as Anon reached out to switches and circuit breakers all over the cockpit. \u201cOverhead switches - circuit breakers - in! External lights - anti collision - on! Cargo reel, wipers, heating - off!\u201d The sound of dexedrine popping out of a blister strip came from the cabin, as Reed popped some government-issue amphetamines into his hand and passed them wordlessly to Trish. Anon started the MedEvac Huey\u2019s turbine as a nearby gunship\u2019s rotor began spinning, both engines screaming higher and louder. Fang\u2019s snoot brushed up against his cheek and lay there for a silent few seconds as he raised a free hand to lightly tap it, then she turned back to the checklist and began to speak.\n\n\u201cAlright, VVURM DRAMA!\u201d A pink fuzzy forearm thrust into the cockpit holding a wad of gauze, forefinger and thumb making a fingergun. \u201cRecapping that briefing!

The UHF radio crackled: \u201ccontact on the tree line, one fifty feet north of the white smoke. Friendlies by the red. Repeat, contact north of white, friendlies by red.\u201d\n\n  Fang hit the transmit button. \u201cStella, strafe that treeline when we\u2019re in range, one fifty north of white smoke. Ground troops, get ready for dustoff.\u201d Then over the crew headsets, \u201cAnon, take us in on the red smoke. Reed, Trish, we\u2019re expecting two casualties hit by shrapnel, one more took multiple rounds to the stomach.\u201d \n\n  A brief pause; then rockets, 7.62mm rounds, and wholly inaudible Latin screeching whooshed, zipped, and reverberated towards a treeline that had been abandoned for at least five minutes. Anon guided his chopper down beside the wounded soldiers, face characteristically blank but hands white on the joystick. A lean and fuzzy pink body jumped the last ten feet with first aid kit in hand, then sprinted towards two curled up figures, while purple hands prepared a stretcher.\n\n  The next few minutes Reed and Trish were a blur of motion. A pallid and comatose archeopteryx with extensive stomach wounds was rapidly triaged and her wounds bandaged, then bundled into a stretcher; a caveman with nasty shrapnel wounds to his right side was dosed with morphine, the squad\u2019s medic having used all their issued supply, then slid onto their second stretcher; a weeping stego with gouges across her face and a fractured wrist was gently led to the cabin by Reed. Calm as only a part-time medic and full-time junkie with steady and regular access to Chinese carfentanyl could be, the ex-drummer dabbed Mercurachrome antiseptic onto the wounds of his patient and nodded as she wailed. \n  \u201cI hit the tripwire... I kicked it... he was right beside me and I kicked it\u201d.\n\n  Trish hopped back into the heli and grabbed her M16, eyes scanning the treeline as the stretchers were loaded.\n  Fang nudged Anon in the side. \u201cTake us up.\u201c\n  Rosa fired one last desultory M60 burst at the empty jungle as the gunship broke off, following Anon as he flew the medevac heli back to Tan Son Nhut.\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  Nurses and orderlies descended on the heli, lifting the stretchers out with professional ease. Reed wandered off after them. Trish, caught between the jitters of Dexedrine and a splitting headache, defaulted to her usual personality of \u201ccontrol freak\u201d and descended on a gaggle of mechanics like a tiny purple eagle attacking a litter of defenceless enlisted kittens. \n\n  Anon and Fang stepped through the postflight checklist, then strode off over the scorching airbase tarmac to the mess hall. Anon poured two cups of military-quality coffee, while Fang retrieved her guitar and began tuning it, plucking quietly at each string.\n  Anon looked over at her. \u201cDo you realise you stick your tongue out like a constipated snake when you play?\u201d\n  Fang flicked a guitar pick at him. He completely failed to catch it, and it bounced off his forehead onto the table, where she retrieved it with a smug glance.\n\n  Taking a long gulp and grimacing, Fang abandoned her coffee, and began to play. It was a nameless improvised tune in a major key, but she played it soft and slow, dragging out rests and borrowing chords from the minor. Anon rested his head on his arms as she poured her heart and soul out for just the two of them, tired notes cascading through the empty mess hall."},"Fortunate Snoot Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Fortunate Snoot Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"Fortunate Snoot - part 3\n------------------------\n\n  Fang, Anon, Trish, and Reed stood to attention, along with all the 57th Medical Detachment stationed at Tan Son Nhut and their escort gunship crews. Major Charles L Skelly addressed them. Bone-thin and gaunt, the caveman\u2019s return to lead the detachment was jokingly rumored to be as much voodoo as medical science.\n  \u201cThe following crews will step forward when named and gather their belongings when dismissed.

Doctordoctor, Foetal Position...\u201d He walked down the line naming pairs of names, five medevac and five gunship crews.\n\n  Dismissed, the lot of them headed off towards the barracks. Trish booted a rat away from her feet with a grimace. \n  \u201cHarsh, man\u201d said Reed, and yawned.\n  \u201cSomething keep you up?\u201d said Fang innocently.\n  \u201cNo idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n  \u201cSomething green and into tarot readings?\u201d\n  \u201cA true bro keeps one eye out for future brodowns\u201d intoned Reed, blushing slightly.\n  Fang cackled and swung open the barracks door.\n\n  Behind them, Anon eyed Trish as her emotional compass swung from shocked, to devastated, to aroused, back to shocked, and settled into an even sourer look than usual.\n  \u201cStop checking out Trish\u2019s fat ass and give me a hand with my kit, Anon\u201d snipped Fang.\n  \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n  Anon quickly packed Fang\u2019s uniforms into her duffel bag as she hauled them onto the double bed, then switched over to pulling out his own uniform as she packed. Across the barracks, Reed and Trish worked independently and a good deal slower on their single beds. Fang reverently strapped her guitar case closed, then lay on the bed for a moment with her eyes closed. \n  \u201cUUUGGGhhhhhhhhh, time for this briefing.\u201d She pushed off the bed and walked out the door.\n  Anon walked over to Reed and the two of them quickly finished stuffing his lightly creased uniforms away, an unobtrusive plastic-wrapped package nestled under layers of protective khaki fabric. One pink fist-bump, and Reed sauntered out the door in search of somewhere to take a nap.\n\n  Anon turned finally to Trish. She wordlessly handed him clothing and knickknacks and he packed it away. She yanked the zipper shut, and the two of them began carting duffel bags outside as she finally opened her mouth.\n  \u201cYou must think I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d\n  Anon, having long since learnt his lesson, stayed quiet.\n  \u201cAll these years and he still just walks out like that. If you or Fang were packing, he\u2019d be there in a flash.\u201d She looked down. \n  Anon risked an \u201cmmmm.\u201d\n  \u201cI\u2019m Trish, I\u2019m the hardass, I\u2019m the crew chief, I\u2019m the business manager, I\u2019m the one who sorts shit out. Trish never needs help.\u201d She chokes. \u201cTrish never hesitates. Trish never waits around for her year-long crush to make a move until he fucks the airbase weeb.\u201d\n\n  She threw her arms around Anon, who was diligently keeping his mouth shut with an expression of dawning horror. \u201cI let him go, Anon. The one thing in life I didn\u2019t fight for, didn\u2019t bloody my knuckles to get, the one time I trusted someone else and waited, and he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s gone.\u201d \n\n  She broke down sobbing and Anon gently maneuvered her down to sit on the edge of the bed, his arm around her. He hoverhanded for a second, until compelled to rub her shoulder by the mental image of Principal Spears roaring at him.\n  \u201c\u00a1No te puedo creer!\u201d shouted Rosa, walking past outside the barracks door. Trish looked up at the lime-green stego walking beside her, eyes full of hate."},"Fortunate Snoot Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Fortunate Snoot Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"Fortunate Snoot\n part 4 (rev1)\n---------------\n\n  Ten Hueys thundered through the clear blue sky in a rough V pattern, like a flock of belligerent turbine-powered geese. Half had red crosses, the others bristled with rocket pods and 7.62mm miniguns. A caveboy with no discernable face and a pterodactyl girl whose snoot protruded about a foot in front of her sat in a cockpit near the middle of the formation. A pink fluffy medic in aviators and a puffy-eyed purple triceratops sat behind them in the cabin. \n\n  Fang held a commercial radio up to her mic. It was switched to the North Vietnamese Army propaganda station Radio Hanoi, and three of the four were uncontrollably giggling at the broadcast.\n\n  \u201c-mislead by your leaders! They have sadly misinformed you of the true facts of why you are here! To be exploded, bayoneted, torn into pieces for a lie, do you want this?

Your time is up, GI Joe. Tick, tock.\u201d\n  \u201cTick, tock,\u201d echoed Fang and Anon, in the manner of a devout churchgoer saying amen, then burst into laughter again.\n  \u201cMan, she never gets old,\u201d said Reed.\n\n  A recording of a truly awful Vietnamese soprano began playing, voice rising into an unearthly screech. Fang winced and switched over to the US-run Armed Forces Vietnam Network, which at least had decent taste in music. The UH-1 flew on through a warm blue sky over a brilliant green jungle.\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  As they arrived at Soc Trang, the fact it was a great deal more spartan than Tan Son Nhut really hit home. The larger air base in Saigon had a mess hall, air conditioning, and even a bar. Soc Trang had a bunch of ramshackle huts with sandbags along all the walls, some still with shrapnel lodged in them or sporting burn marks.\n\n  They stood to attention yet again and listened to yet another primer on what they were doing here. The group were now stationed much closer to the front. They would be able to support an increasingly strung out and scattered \u201cfrontline,\u201d insofar as the current clusterfuck of a war even had one. They were replacing a group who\u2019d been stationed there for a month straight. They were to give nothing less than 110%. They were to uphold the finest traditions of the airforce. They were representing their country. So on, and so on, and so on.\n\n  After a boring half an hour in the hot sun they were dismissed, and left to settle into their lodgings. Trish flopped her bag down and left to go establish dominance amongst her fellow crew chiefs and specialist technicians, Fang was dragged away to another briefing, and Reed and Anon were left alone.\n\n  \u201cHey man, got a couple of \u2018business contacts\u2019 to reach out to,\u201d said Reed. \u201cWant to come with?\u201d\n  \u201cWhat are you getting me into, Reed?\u201d muttered Anon, before saying \u201cno problem!\u201d in a much louder and clearer voice.\n  \u201cFirst one is a corporal assigned to perimeter guard duty here. We\u2019ll go say hi, see if he can get his hands on some dope or whatever. Slowly build up the relationship with a couple of minor deals.\u201d He passed a small rectangle to Anon.\n  \u201c...Reed Import\/Export business cards? Seriously?

Coming up through the gap between two of the dilapidated barracks, she saw a silhouette push itself off the wall in front of her.\n\n  \u201cA big shot police commissioner\u2019s daughter, all the way out here?\u201d a white-scaled orange-crested Dilophosaurus sneered. \u201cWhat, daddy didn\u2019t buy your way out? Or did you actually volunteer to be here?\u201d\n  \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d asked Fang, feeling more confused than angry.\n  \u201cYou\u2019re Ripley Aaron\u2019s kid, right? Volcano High, shitty emo-rock band, rebellious species-mixing boyfriend?\u201d The Dilophosaurus grabbed her shoulder roughly. \u201cThat old asshole is the one in charge of rounding up draft dodgers for Caldera Bay. You\u2019re gonna find that neither he nor you are real popular here.\u201d He pushed past her roughly and rammed her into the side of the hut, face screwed up with disgust, then sauntered off.\n  Fang looked down at her muddy arm, the shock of the unexpected confrontation giving way to the pumping adrenaline of fight-or-flight. \u201cFuck you too, asshole!\u201d she screamed at his back, and picked up a dirty discarded bottle from the ground to hurl. It exploded into shards on a beam behind him.\n\n  Then more quietly as she leant against the wall and waited for the jitters to subside. \u201cDad?\u201d she whispered.\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  Trish clambered up onto Rosa\u2019s heli. She reached down to grab the socket wrench from Rosa.\n  \u201cThanks for offering to help swap out the rotor assembly, mi amiga. I\u2019m good at the heavy lifting, but these bolts\u2026 al diablo con esos.\u201d Rosa crossed herself after the minor blasphemy.\n  \u201cHey, a woman who promises me a tail-rotor driveshaft with two thousand flight hours left gets whatever she wants,\u201d Trish replied. Both dinos smiled the warm but predatory smile of two mothers providing for a pair of enormous metal babies.\n\n  They attached the first rotor blade to a hand crane, beginning the first hour of the many they\u2019d spend swapping out the rotor assembly.\n  Trish gossiped as she removed bolts. \u201cSooooo... I overheard some of the rotor specialists say that rustbucket Doctordoctor would be out for at least a week after they found a ding on her rotor yoke - inventory doesn\u2019t have a spare. Might be worth checking out, see if we can arrange some early Christmas presents from the rubes.\u201d\n  \u201cEsos tontos. They would give up their mothers for a six pack of beer. That\u2019s where your new driveshaft comes from.\u201d\n  Trish gasped. \u201cA six pack?\u201d She shook her head in derision. \u201cLike taking candy from a baby.\u201d\n\n  They worked on into the night. Trish sank herself into the gossiping, banter, and hard work. She could almost forget Rosa was on the same crew as Stella.\n"},"Fortunate Snoot Chapter 5.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Fortunate Snoot Chapter 5.txt"],"text":"Fortunate Snoot\n part 5 (rev1)\n---------------\n\n  They'd been on base at Soc Trang for three days, mostly flying routine medical transport missions, and it was finally mail call day. The entire mess hall seethed with impatience.\n\n  Fang\u2019s tail tapped a nervous staccato rhythm against her seat. She alternated between talking to Stella, endlessly tuning her guitar, and scratching at her wings. Trish was practically vibrating as she tried to read a workshop manual, occasionally standing up and walking around aimlessly. Anon and Reed arm wrestled the marine assigned to be door gunner of Stella and Rosa\u2019s gunship, a bulky t-rex with ludicrously tiny forearms and biceps. Every single dino and human in the mess hall glanced at the door whenever it opened.\n\n  To understand the importance of mail call, you had to know just how little news from home troops could get while deployed. To make a radio call you had to either suck up to the operators of a very illegal pirate HAM radio station and beg for some precious minutes, or have the good luck to be stationed on a base with a legitimate MARS radio and the patience to queue for it. Telephones were practically non-existent outside civilian telegraph offices in the bigger cities. This made mail the sole reliable lifeline of communication with those back home, and mail call was the all-important handing out of those letters. The base was hours or maybe minutes away from receiving the only news they\u2019d get all month.\n\n  After 20 long minutes, Rosa burst in the door carrying a bulky sack of mail, followed by an officer. Every head in the mess turned to stare. \u201cAn-on! Help mi with las correspondencia.\u201d The two of them spread bundles of letters and parcels over the table, and the officer began calling names.\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  Back in the barracks with their mail, the gang sat down and began opening it.\n\n  Trish squealed. \u201cMom sent cookies!\u201d She rapidly tore into her package and put one in her mouth, chomping away happily. \u201cOa\u2019mea\u2019 n\u2019 raishin,\u201d she said with a full mouth.\n\n  In response to the idea of oatmeal and raisin, Fang mimed gagging, but without looking up from her letter. She finished reading through it, then said \u201cDad says he\u2019s got nobody to practice his golf swing with, now Anon\u2019s gone. Moe\u2019s hired Jerry again. Volcano High finally fixed the hole Spears kicked in that roof fence. Mr Ringo joined the navy. What did you get, Anon?\u201d\n\n  Anon groaned and held up the one letter he\u2019d received. It said \u201cOutstanding Unpaid Balance\u201d in big red letters, followed by a forest of fine print.\n\n  Reed was struggling with a large package. He finally ripped the tape off, revealing a box with \u201cPatented Walton Belt Vibrator\u201d written on it. The contraption advertised \u201cyears of pleasure and fitness.\u201d\n\n  Fang\u2019s eyes went wide, and she gasped \u201cNo fucking way, Reed! What is THAT?\u201d\n\n  Reed winked at her and shook the box. It clinked as glassware hit glassware. \u201cFitness is important.\u201d\n\n  \u201cOh, it\u2019s just another degenerate \u2018business shipment\u2019 of yours in a dumb box.

Anon and Fang lay in companionable silence, Anon reading a book on record cutting, Fang still going over her letters from home. \n\n  Moe, Samantha, golf, Jerry, school, Nasser had apparently enlisted as a surgeon\u2026 not a word about his work. Had that dilophosaurus been right about him? Even if he was catching draft during dodgers, was her dad in the wrong? She'd been drafted herself, after all. She'd called the war colonialist French meddling, but she'd still gone through flight school and officer training. She hadn't dodged anything.\n\n  \"Do you ever look around at base, and wonder how many of them really want to be here?\" she said suddenly. \n\n  Anon put his book down then turned to her with raised eyebrows. \n\n  Fang went on, \"You're the only enlisted man in our crew, and you're only here because your dad threatened to send you back to Brazil or disinherit you. Reed, Trish, me, we're all from the draft.\" \n\n  \"Never really thought about our crew in particular,\" said Anon, \"but you're right in general. Most people here hate the draft, even the ones who support the war.\"\n\n  Fang was silent for a while. \"Remember when you told me there were too many useless people in the world?\" \n  \"Hmmmm?\" \n  \"What if all those generals and senators and\u2026 and police commissioners, what if they think we're the useless people? What if this whole war is just thinning the herd to them?\"\n\n  \"You're not useless. We're not useless.

She put her dad's letter aside and wrapped her arms around Anon.\n\n  ~~~~\n\n  It was past midnight when the siren went off. The crew jogged out onto the tarmac. They all knew the drill by now; Fang and Anon in the cockpit going through the preflight checklist, Reed in the back sorting through the medical supplies, Trish checking her and Reed\u2019s harnesses and loading a magazine into her rifle. She\u2019d chamber a round when they got close.\n\n  To the left, Stella, another pilot, Rosa, and the arm-wrestling t-rex from the mess got into their own heli.\n\n  Fang listened intently to the radio, then said \u201cTake us south-west, Anon. I\u2019ll have the exact coordinates soon. There\u2019s an M113 personnel carrier that\u2019s rolled over on the road out of C\u00e0 Mau. A mechanised infantry platoon are out there trying to right it, and they've come under fire from Vietcong in a night raid and taken casualties.\u201d\n\n  The heli flew south into the night. Soon, they could see tracers and fire in the distance. Two jets roared past them towards the fight, then roared back in the other direction minutes later.\n\n  \"Gonna be a hot landing zone, ladies and gentlemen and enbies and attack helicopters,\" said Fang over UHF radio and their headsets.\n\n  \"Thank you for giving attack helicopters the recognition they deserve,\" replied Stella primly, but her heart wasn't in it.\n\n  They all knew what a hot LZ meant. They'd be taking constant fire, potentially from more than one side, while trying to extract wounded troops.

She was as prepared as she could get. She was psyched, she had the course layout papers she\u2019d give out piled up under one arm, she had a rough plan of what she\u2019d do for the lesson laid out in her head. She was ready. She was... well, still a little nervous, if she was to be totally honest with herself.\nShe was a real teacher now, not a lowly assistant, and this was to be her very first lesson. The grand beginning of her hopefully long and distinguished career as a music teacher. It was a little nerve-wracking when she thought about it like that. Just a little bit. \nShe knew the ins and outs of running a class by now, after however-many-it-had-been years of being assistant music teacher at Volcano High. She knew everything that would be expected of her throughout the year \u2013 more or less, anyway. She knew she was ready for more. Towards the end of her last year, she\u2019d started searching for a position somewhere, and she\u2019d found one fairly quickly in a tiny little town called Hometown. It was the perfect opportunity, but after doing some research on the quiet, insular town, she\u2019d realized it left Anon kind of high and dry for job opportunities. There wasn\u2019t much work for a sound engineer in an old, rustic town with a population of a few hundred, after all. \nNonetheless, after talking about it with him, they\u2019d decided to go for it and make the move to the tiny little town. He was still looking for something in neighbouring Ebott City, but in the meantime her term was starting here and now. If she could push past her nerves, anyway.\nShe tried to push her second-guessing out of her head as she turned the last corner, and saw her class gathered in a loose gaggle near the door. Her heart thumped hard in her chest as the thought struck her.\nHer class. \nShe really was a real teacher now. This was her class, right here, proof in the pudding. She was making it happen. She was doing it.\n\u201cKris, remind me why I\u2019m taking this elective again?\u201d The closest student to her, a bulky, purple monster of some sort, was grousing away in a gravelly voice as she leaned against the wall. With her back turned, Lucy could see little of her other than a thin jacket and a raggedy head of hair, but guessed from the scales she could see on her forearm that she was some kind of dino. \u201cI hate music.\u201d\nThe comparatively diminutive human kid in front her seemed to take extreme exception to her words, standing up out of his slouch and drawing in a visible breath as he turned around. He caught sight of Lucy standing there, though, and whatever he was about to say died on his lips as his face fell into a perfectly flat expression. \n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a pretty dumb thing to say sitting right in front of the music teacher.\u201d Lucy seized the moment to announce herself, unable to entirely keep the amusement out of her voice.\nThe purple monster whirled around with a surprised gasp. Lucy had a cheeky followup to go with her quip, but found it dead on her lips. Instead she had to keep a sudden, unwarranted spike of nervousness down as the monster girl\u2019s sheer size was made apparent. Raptor Jesus above, this kid was taller than her and somehow managed to look both built and wiry at the same time. Hopefully she wouldn\u2019t be trouble. Still \u2013 she was the teacher. She was in charge, no matter how tall or terrifying this kid might be and she wouldn\u2019t be intimidated, no sir. \nHer students had noticed her arrival. She took stock of her class, and immediately noticed just how... weird all of them were. Not weird in a bad way, but definitely representative of the monster-majority town in their weirdness. In this one class alone, there was a yellow lizard kid with no arms, a large... cat of some sort with her eyes glued to her phone, and a snake in a shirt and baseball cap. A literal snake. No arms or legs. Poor guy.\nShe\u2019d met a few of Hometown\u2019s residents already in the days since she\u2019d moved in while out and about around the town. She didn\u2019t get any feeling of being unwelcome amongst the townfolk or the school faculty, but she still felt distinctly out of place. The first time she\u2019d gone out to buy groceries, she distinctly remembered wondering if she was getting a taste of what Anon had felt like on his first day at Volcano High. The guy who ran the local store literally looked like a skeleton, for crying out loud, bones and eye sockets and all. \nStill, she wouldn\u2019t judge. She\u2019d met weirder. Hell, she\u2019d married weirder.\n\u201cMorning, everyone,\u201d She gave them a chipper smile as she fished around in her pocket with her free hand. \u201cGimme a sec to find my keys, I\u2019ll let you all in...\u201d\nShe strode past them in a way that she hoped emphasized confidence and unlocked the door. As the class filed in behind her, she dropped her papers onto her desk and turned to face her charges with a smile.\nThe kids found their seats and stared up at her expectantly, and for a moment, Lucy felt her breath hitch in her chest. This was the moment that she\u2019d been preparing for \u2013 her first words to her first class, the meeting that would colour their opinions of her for the rest of the term, the rest of the year, the rest of her career here at Hometown. She\u2019d had a whole speech ready to impress her potential proteges. \nUnfortunately, she couldn\u2019t remember a word of it at this exact moment. \nAll she could remember was Anon\u2019s heartwarming smile as she left the house that morning. \u2018You\u2019ll do fine, Fang. Don\u2019t doubt yourself.\u2019 No, she didn\u2019t doubt herself, that wasn\u2019t the problem she was having, stupid lovable bastard. \nFuck it, she\u2019d just have to wing it.\n\u201cSo! Good morning, everyone.\u201d She gave her class a wide smile, and a curt nod. Casual professionalism. Casual professionalism, just like she\u2019d practiced. A good first impression. Best way to win \u2018em over. \u201cI\u2019m Mrs. Mous \u2013 Nice to meet you all. I won\u2019t make you do any of that dumb \u2018tell me about yourself\u2019 crap, but since I\u2019m newer here than any of you, I am gonna need some introductions at least.\u201d\nShe pointed first toward the little deer monster at the front of the class, prompting her with another short nod.\n\u201cEr \u2013 H-Hi, Mrs. Mous. I\u2019m Noelle.\u201d The doe\u2019s voice was timid and quiet, and she kept her eyes down on her desk as she spoke.\n\u201cNice to meet you, Noelle.\u201d Lucy said happily. Deciding she would tick off the morning\u2019s roll call as she went, she fished it out of the stack of papers before she pointed towards the next student, a horribly smug-looking blue bird.\nHe cleared his throat before talking in the most nasal voice Lucy had ever heard. \u201cGood morning, ma\u2019am. My name\u2019s Berdly.\u201d\nLucy managed to keep her polite face on. She would not cringe, goddamnit, she had to be respectful with them. \u201cGood morning to you too, Berdly.\u201d\nThey went on through the introductions, and Lucy struggled to commit each of her students\u2019 names and faces to memory. She\u2019d been center stage for larger audiences than this before, larger by far, but the interactions between a band and a crowd were a lot more onesided than this. She was a teacher this time, not a singer. She\u2019d never had to directly manage so many people before. It was really weird, when she thought about it \u2013 nearly half her life, she\u2019d been one of those kids sat behind a desk, and now she was on the other end of the classroom. Now she was the one up the front, the one that everyone would be paying attention to. All eyes on her \u2013 just like a performance.\nBut hell, she was good at those. She was just worrying herself overly much. People hadn\u2019t given Mr. Carldelewski  any grief, after all, and he barely constituted being called a teacher. Now she thought about it, until the last half of her last year, she herself hadn\u2019t even really cared for half the lessons she\u2019d had to sit through at Volcano High back then. These kids probably just wanted to get through the class without any hassles, just like her. They weren\u2019t so different. She\u2019d be fine.\nJust a few students left. She pointed toward the tremendous purple dino up the back, who\u2019d already taken the liberty of leaning lazily back in her chair, seemingly completely chill now.\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Susie.\u201d She accompanied her short introduction with a lazy, two-fingered half salute. \n\u201cMorning, Susie.\u201d Lucy checked off her name, then pointed at the last kid. The human in the far corner.\nHer brows furrowed as he initially failed to respond. Odd vibes from this kid, now that she was looking at him properly. Something strange about him she couldn\u2019t quite place. Maybe it was the face \u2013 with his eyes completely covered by his bangs and a blank, emotionless expression on, it was hard to get a read on him. Hopefully he wouldn\u2019t be another one to watch out for.\n\u201c... Kris.\u201d He finally introduced himself, his scratchy voice just barely loud enough for her to hear.\n\u201cAnd morning, Kris!\u201d She beamed, putting the roll behind her with the last name ticked off. First hurdle cleared. \u201cOkay, so! Let\u2019s get right into it. Music \u2013 You\u2019re all here because you\u2019ve got an appreciation for it on some level, I\u2019m presuming. Everyone does, really, whether they admit it or not. Whether they know it or not.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t miss how Susie shifted in her seat slightly.\n\u201cSeriously. Absolutely everyone, believe it or not. No matter where you go, you\u2019ll find music\u2019s been our constant companion going back thousands of years now. It inspires people, it sets moods, it allows people to truly express what they feel and who they are. Music is quite literally in our blood \u2013 or dust as it might be,\u201d She corrected herself quickly. She didn\u2019t need any sensitivity training to remember to be sensitive, especially in a monster majority class. \u201cAbsolutely everyone appreciates music on some level. Hopefully, this year, you\u2019ll walk away with both a greater knowledge of music, and a greater appreciation for it.\u201d\nThe class seemed to hang on her every word. If they were in a church she might have mistaken the silence for reverence as they looked up at her.  Except for Susie and Kris up the back, that was... with their faces shadowed by their fringes as they were, for all she knew they might have just been asleep. She forged onward anyway, deciding it would be better to give them the benefit of the doubt for at least her first lesson. \n\u201cSo I\u2019ve got your course outlines for this year here \u2013 Noelle, how about you hand this half out for me? \u2013 and we\u2019ll just run through them together quickly before we get started...\u201d\n\n-\n\nAll in all, her first class had gone as well as she could have hoped. No real mistakes, got through everything she wanted \u2013 an easy A performance by anyone\u2019s measure. Or it would be if she was still the one being graded, that was. \nAfter breezing through their introduction to the class, Lucy had spent the rest of the lesson getting a feel for where her students stood with regards to musical skill. It seemed like a fine enough place to start; being new to the school herself, she didn\u2019t know the first thing about any of the kids in her class, and she\u2019d need to get better acquainted with them at some point.\nSome of them were pretty promising. The armless... lizard kid had thoroughly surprised her with his proud proclamation that he played the trumpet, and then proceeded to surprise her even more by actually doing it. And pretty well to boot, in spite of the fact that he was playing with his feet. The quiet little deer girl had somehow only ever played a sleigh bell, of all things, but she had a lovely singing voice that would do her pretty well as part of a choir. And the human kid had endeared her well enough with his quiet admission that he played piano. \nThere were a few complications in the bag, though. Students of the class were supposed to already be reasonably well grounded in music coming into the elective, but there were a few who, for one reason or another, simply weren\u2019t. In particular the snake \u2013 Jockington, his name was, God his parents must have hated him \u2013 had a few home truths to face up to. He admitted freely he\u2019d never held an instrument in his life, and given his lack of arms, she didn\u2019t doubt that claim. His prospects for learning to play something were pretty slim as well \u2013 she didn\u2019t really want to disparage, but being completely limbless kinda sorta severely limited his options for playing an instrument. Given those two factors, she couldn\u2019t honestly guess why he had signed up for the class.\nAnd then there was the other musically disinclined student of the class \u2013 the massive purple whatever-she-was, Susie. Lucy had presumed her to be a dino of some sort, but she actually had no idea what species. She didn\u2019t fit any mold. \nIn any case, although she might have been physically capable, she seemed to have near to no musical experience whatsoever. She\u2019d just stared blankly at the example sheet music Lucy had passed around the class, and Lucy was pretty sure that she\u2019d seen her right afterward trying to look over Kris\u2019s shoulder. Like it was an exam sheet she could copy answers off of.\nAgain, she didn\u2019t really want to put anyone down... but at the same time, she was honestly pretty sure she\u2019d died inside a little after seeing that.\nShe\u2019d have to talk to both Susie and Jockington and see what she could sort out. Most of the class had already left, but Susie was still loitering around near the door, waiting for Kris as he fiddled around with his bag. They seemed to be friends to some degree, but Lucy couldn\u2019t really imagine a more unfitting pair. Susie looked like she could pick him up with one hand and toss him through a window if he pissed her off.\n\u201cSusie, would you come up here for a moment before you go, please?\u201d She called out as they finally made to leave.\n\u201cWha \u2013 Am I in trouble already? It\u2019s the first day, I didn\u2019t even do anything!\u201d The purple monster growled, her hands thrust out in incredulity.\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not in trouble! I just need to talk to you about something,\u201d Lucy reassured her. She had no idea how she was going to break the news, though. What she was about to say was the kind of thing that, personally, she wouldn\u2019t want spread around. \u201cKris, you don\u2019t have to stay if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nTo her consternation, the pair of them just exchanged glances and a shrug, and Kris actually started to follow Susie up to the desk. Of course he had to stay and make it awkward. Ah well.\n \u201cSusie, why did you decide to take this elective? You haven\u2019t taken any music electives before, have you?\u201d\nShe just shrugged. \u201cI dunno. Kris was taking it. I had to pick something.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, Susie, I don\u2019t want to discourage anyone from pursuing music, but you might consider switching electives before it\u2019s too late in the year. With no prior music experience, this is going to be a really hard class for you.\u201d\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything else good I could pick, though,\u201d Susie looked away, a sharp grimace on her face. \u201cIt didn\u2019t say I needed to know an instrument or any crap like that to be in this class.\u201d\n\u201cStrictly speaking, you don\u2019t. Music isn\u2019t just about knowing an instrument,\u201d Lucy clarified. \u201cIt is an extremely important part of it, though. Actually playing is the best way to show what you\u2019ve learned for your tests and exams, and it makes up a lot of your credit. It provides a lot of the fundamentals you\u2019re expected to know in this class, too.\u201d\nSusie scoffed. \u201cSo what am I supposed to do, then?\u201d\n \u201cI could help her learn something.\u201d Kris cut in quietly before Lucy could answer, drawing her attention. \u201cIf she can play something, can she stay?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t kicking her out.\u201d Lucy said insistently as she considered it. It was a good idea, but... \u201cLearning an instrument obviously isn\u2019t something you can do overnight. It takes time and dedication.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what are my other options exactly?\u201d\n\u201cSwitch electives, or keep going.\u201d Inwardly she winced. Sounded painful when she just said it plainly like that, but that was the stark reality of it. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m not kicking you out, Susie, but... you\u2019re really going to struggle with a lot of the coursework at this point.\u201d \nSusie stared Lucy down for a tense moment before giving another scoff. \u201cWhatever. Nothing\u2019s ever easy, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in learning something, it would take a lot of work. You\u2019d have to spend time doing it at lunch and after school.\u201d Lucy sighed and ran a hand through her hair. She felt bad for the poor kid. She didn\u2019t want to just leave her high and dry. \u201cLook, I could maybe spend some lunchtimes helping you out. I taught my husband how to play guitar. But you have to promise that you\u2019ll be serious about it, alright? No half measures.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll help too.\u201d Kris offered again. He had a tiny little smile on his face as he looked up at her. \u201cIf you want.\u201d\nSusie met his gaze, and for the first time in the conversation, a look of genuine consideration fell upon her face. \u201cHmm... Guitar, huh..?\u201d","Title":"Heart And Hometown","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Kris, Susie, Berdly and Noelle","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"How Fang's Mom Figured it Out.txt":{"path":["Multiple","How Fang's Mom Figured it Out.txt"],"text":"Title: How Fang's Mom Figured it Out.\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Samantha, Ripley, Reeda, Trish, Moe, Anon\nRating: Semi-NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Haremanon\n\n\nSnoot Game - how Fang's mom figured it out\n\n>Summer 2040, Volcadera Bluff\n>It was a hot day, perfect for dinos and bearable for humans.\n>Perfect for a family meeting in the Volcadera Park, grills included.\n\n>\"I've always wondered about Trish, dear.\"\n>Fang froze.\n>\"Rea, I understood.

Before he hits the road, he gives one last goodbye before leaving his life behind for a long four years.\n\n\nHave I ever told you how much these clown vomit colored posse of meteor dodgers meant to me? Good lord... You couldn't imagine.\n\nThis wonderful group of dinosaur retardation has brought me to a new place in the world. No longer am I stuck hiding in the dark corners of my room waiting for the sun to give its epitaph for that day. No longer am I staring at the dirt in seemingly eternal uncertainty. I'm a brand-new man thanks to all of them. It's brought me a feeling that... well...\n\nI could imagine that what I have felt was a sneak peek of what the afterlife in heaven gives to you. Now, I've never been too sure of the idea of a higher being creating everything that we see before our eyes, but... this experience is making me genuinely think about it. There can't be a feeling like the one I had that wasn't made by someone of unimaginable power.\n\nBut, as we all know, sometimes we can take it for granted. Every now and then, we come to realize this and do our best to live in the moment, and when we do, it's a glorious thing. But, even with this, everyone will have something and won't realize its importance until its...\n\nGone.\n\nHere I am, standing in the hallway right by the main doors inside Volcano High. Everyone that I have met here has come with me for our final moments together. Due to unfortunate political tensions, I've been asked to prematurely join the Navy. With this, that means... I have to leave everyone else behind. My grand adventure comes to an end here and now. This is the apex of it all, the one heart stab that could stay with me for my entire life. I'll no longer be able to enjoy Reed's sophisticated manner, hear Trish's confused-aroused-cute anger, feel Naser's brotherly care, understand Rosa's determination, tolerate Naomi's endless yapping, enjoy Stella's soothing tarots...\n\nand... I won't be with the love of my life.\n\nFang's grasping my jacket as her claws threaten to poke the cloth. She's been sobbing for a while, hopelessly attempting to stay calm for me, but it all just keeps pushing as time goes on. She forces her head down from all of the pressure, unable to look at me in the eye. It's as if I have done something so unforgivable, so devoid of any righteousness that it's classified me as the root of all evil. Hell, everyone's devastated by my premature exit from their world. This isn't what I wanted, but fate's cruel ways of building our character spares no one. Even the most good person in the world could be hit with the worst of outcomes.\n\n\"Fang... look at me.\" Her bloodshot puffy eyes begin to stare into mine with an endless void. This was the look of someone who experienced true loss, who was nearing the edge. \"Well, actually- everyone?\" all eyes pierce mine as they await anxiously for me to continue. \"This may be a goodbye, but it's not a farewell. Th-\" I begin to choke up. Not now, Anon. You can do this. \"This isn't the end. You all still have each other. I won't be here for a while, but that doesn't mean I'm leaving forever. It'll just... be a while is all....\" It starts again, tears beginning to break through as I futily try to stay calm. \"Believe me I-I don't wanna say goodbye either. You guys mean everything to me. I...\"\n\nI give Fang an embrace of my own as I begin to lose control. Holding on to her as tight as I can, I struggle to stand and thus begin pulling her and I down toward the ground. The world melts around the two of us as our vision fades to black, hugging each other harder than we ever have before. This may as well be the final time we feel each other's loving touch for a while... I need to live in it.\n\nI gravely return to normal, with a wave of clarity ceasing my tears. I let out a shaky sigh as I lean in for the final time. In... out. In... out. In...\n\nWe let go of each other, one more time.\n\nOut.\n\nThe air slowly brushes by me as I give her what I hoped was a soothing smile. I take one more heavy breath as I begin the hardest part of it all, and that's officially saying goodbye to all of my friends.\n\nSlowly making my way to everyone else, I shake at the thought of the current situation. This was probably the hardest thing I've ever done, but there was no going back on any of it now. This was probably going to be the very last time I saw everyone together for a while, and I need to live in the moment while I still can. Time will stop for no one as they say... I guess I should go to Naser first as he's the closest to me. Ever so slowly making my way up to him, he flashes me a content smile. This tells me all I needed to know, and it was that I did him damn proud. Not only as a partner for his sister, but as his best friend. He's telling me that I've truly grown, and I wouldn't deny it for even a second. \n\n\"Oh, Naser...\"\n\"Ah, come on! Like you mean it Anon!\"\n\nHe pulls me in with the obligatory hand-hold\/hug, shoulder to shoulder. It's the thing that only real bros do for each other. He gives a fist-pat to the back as he continues. \"You're a real one, you know that?\"\n\nI give myself a few seconds to process what he just said, not being able to help smiling like a goof. Hearing those words brought some much needed joy to me. When you're called a \"real one\", you know for a damn fact that whoever says it really cares about you.\n\n\"You too, dude...\"\n\nAs we let each other go, we take a good final look into our eyes. What follows is a smile and a nod from the both of us... until I turn away, in which I can feel his depression immediately setting back in. Shit, this is going to be a lot more difficult than I thought. I have to gosling 5 more times before I skedaddle out of here?! Seriously?! God, why must you throw me these curve balls? Is this for some stupid character development?\n\nI shake my head as I drag my feet to Naomi. Her sadness is actually a little bit of a surprise to me. I honestly thought that she would have been relieved to see me gone, but I guess that even she has started to bond with me a little bit. I know that she wouldn't necessarily like a hug from me, so I keep my personal distance and just stick with holding her hands. With another one of many slow breaths, I give my goodbye to Naomi. \"If it wasn't for you, we probably wouldn't be here, you know. So... thank you. From the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nI notice her tail wagging a little as she takes pride in my words. At least she's taking what I have to say the right way. However, I give a glare as I continue, to hopefully get my full point across. \"But you have to promise me something.\" Naomi starts to freeze, her breathing becoming somewhat frantic as I continue. \"I need you to promise me that you'll take care of Naser while I'm gone, okay?\" My glare fades away into one of concern. I didn't distrust Naomi, I just needed to know that she would make the effort to keep him happy. She responds with a firm nod, letting me know that she will do the best she can. I suppose that\u2019ll have to do for now.\n\nTrish... I have no idea how she feels about this. She's either going to be overjoyed by me taking my leave or incredibly angry and depressed. Guess there's only one way to find out. I start to close the gap as I make my way over, noticing an expression of racing thoughts. She... looks like she's on the verge of breaking down.\n\n\"Tr-\"\n-SLAP-\n\nOw, what the fuck?! Guess it was the latter!\n\nBefore I can even process the stinging in my cheek Trish is already slamming herself into me with an embrace, unable to control her sobs. She practically impales me with her nails (claws?) as she continuously tries to bring herself closer to me. This hurts like an absolute bitch, but I honestly think I deserved what was coming for a while. I hug back firmly attempting to soothe her, but she's still breaking down in front of me. Before I can begin to say anything to help, Trish beats me to the punch.\n\n\"Why?! Why do you have to go?! Why can't you just stay a little longer, don't leave us behind! Please, you've done so much for us you can't just- just go!\"\n\"Stupid fuckin' skinnie... I don't want you to leave....\"\n\nTrish begins to finally calm down after spilling out her words. For what felt like an eternity, we just hold each other, enjoying each other's company for the time we had together. This trigga has actually started to really bond with me, even after all of the bullshit she threw at my head. At the end of the day, she's someone I can call a true friend, and a true friend that will be surely missed.\n\nWe let go of each other, feeling our catharsis fading into the limelight. I wipe the remaining tears from Trish's lavender eyes and let her know that everything will be alright.\n\n\"Trish....\"\n\"You're going to be okay. I promise you.\"\n\"I'm not going forever, just for a little while. I will be okay.\"\n\"While I'm gone, I want you to stay by Fang's side, no matter what. Help her through the pain and keep an eye out for each other.\"\n\nTrish forces a sniffle through her melancholy. \"...Okay. I will.\"\n\nRosa. Oh, boy. This one's going to be a living hell to get through. Not necessarily for her, but more so for me. For all the times she threatened to bring out the \"Holy Chancla\", I believe that now is going to be the time where I succumb to Raptor Jesus' wrath. If I must be spanked into the 5th dimension for my crimes, then so be it. I don't care that this wasn't my fault, I deserve it anyway.\n\n\"Oh, oh Dios m\u00edo, Anon. I couldn't let you go without saying adi\u00f3s to my favorite boy.\" She approaches me and enshrouds me in a... gentle manner? Well, would you look at that! I'm not having my spine split in half, and this was the last person I expected to keep it that way! Welp, not complaining here! \"But... if you do not come back to us the second you arrive...\" Her fingers clutch through my shirt and into my skin.\n...Shit.\n\"I will find out where you are, beat you with my holy Chancla until your Cuerpo pat\u00e9tico roto is on the ground screaming for my generous mercy, ignore your hopeless pleas, throw you into my house and impale you with my tail, and then use your dismembered corpse as part of the recipe for mi familia's enchiladas! \u00bfENTENDIDO?!\"\n\"Yep! Yep! Yeah! Absolutely! Got it! No problem! Understood 100%!\"\n\nThe furious ankylosaur shoves me back, followed by her pointing at me with the most terrifying \"I'm watching you\" gesture I have ever witnessed. Everyone gives a genuine hearty laugh, enjoying the absolute fear I'm showing to everyone. at least until Rosa responds. \"The same goes for the rest of you tontos!\" Immediately, the whole cast stops dead in tracks with their laughter, leaving the atmosphere with nothing but the sound of emitting electrical light. If everyone came back with new pairs of pants, I wouldn't be surprised. In fact, I'll probably have to go to my drawer one last time before I head off myself. Heh.\n\nReed. Reed, Reed, Reed. This one was definitely going to hit hard. This AnCap Pink Cubone has gotten me out of some really tough shit, along with that he's been nothing but a bro to me ever since we met. I can't think of one time where we genuinely thought we betrayed each other. Oh, how I'm going to miss your carefree attitude and your hidden knowledge (along with that sweet stuff too). Before I can even move, Reed's already won the race by enfolding me with his head over my shoulder. With a shaky sigh, he wraps his tail around my neck, giving it a soft squeeze.\n\nOh, Raptor Jesus, please don't do this to me. Not again. I'm practically living in Blade Runner 2049 now! Stop it!\n\n\"Bro... I already miss you.\"\n\nHis cracking tone sends me over the edge, leading to more quiet sobs coming from me. Reed joins in with a catharsis of his own, breaking my back for the thousandth time today. We truly understood each other, with both of us being social outcasts due to who we are as people. A former weeb and a stoner may come off as an unlikely relationship, but damn whoever said that ours wasn't possible. No matter what, this crazy velociraptor had my back wherever we went, and I have nothing but praise and positivity for him. Leaving him behind was going to especially difficult. With the pressure in my chest about to burst, I respond. \"You too, man. It's going to be real hard without you at my side.\" \nI have Reed face me as I intertwine my fingers behind his neck, a look of confusion and patience shaping Reed's face.\n\n\"Reed, you... you've done so much for me. Heh, you were always by my side whenever I got myself into some deep trouble, and you stuck by even in the worst of situations. You and Naser are the realest bros a skinnie like me could ask for.\"\n\nThe pink Cubone stays silent for a moment, beginning to visibly tense up. The veins in his muscles line themselves out, with said muscles beginning to shake, almost as if its host is in an unholy rage.\n\nOh, no. Did I fuck up?\n\nReed jumps onto me, locking his legs around my waist with his tail now curling around my right leg. His arms go over mine, bringing me closer like there's no tomorrow. Now, call me a homo all you want, but I believe this is the best hug I've ever received. I hug him back as best I can, not bothering with how awkward it may look. This is a true bro moment, and nothing will ruin it.\n\n\"You don't know how much that means to me, compadre. I can't go four years without you, man! I just...\" Before he can finish, another melancholic sigh escapes his lungs. He gives up on saying the rest, hoping that I'll understand, and puts himself back on the ground. With a cold wind brushing past us, I run my fingers through his hair and hold his head towards mine.\n\n\"These four years will be over before you know it. Right when I come home, I'm gonna find you guys and go for a smoke with you. Hold me to it?\" I hold him by the shoulders again, and he does the same.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"You'd better join me for that smoke, bro. I'll be counting on it.\"\n\nWe let each other go, giving ourselves one last grin. 6 Replicant K freak outs down, 1 more to go. Now all that's left is... Stella. This little bundle of weeaboo joy has been so nice to me this whole time, and if I'm going to show my appreciation for it, now's the time. \"Stella, you've shown me nothing but kindness throughout the entire year. If you hadn't shown up in my life, I probably would've been a dick if I'm completely honest. So... thanks for helping me with all of this. You've taught me how to show the care I have for everyone. Thank you.\" I bring her in as gentle of an embrace as I can, exhaling slowly as I do. Stella returns the favor, brushing her cheek by mine. Suddenly, a bright light bulb appears over my head as I have my own revelation.\n\n\"Stella, may I have a single reading? For the future?\" The kawaii stego immediately fishes into her pocket, bringing out the infamous deck. After shuffling it with incredible speed and skill, she takes a deep breath in...\nand flips over the card.\n\nStella's body has turned to stone. Whatever she pulled made it so she was too shocked to move. Her lack of words also has me doing the same. Just what kind of card did she pull?!\n\n\"Your card for the future is...\"\n\"The World!\"\n\nRosa rushes over to Stella, completely dazzled by the results. Neither of the two could believe what was shown right before their eyes. All I can think of is the JoJo stand. Damn you, stupid weebiness! Is that all you can think of during your last moments with your friends? Anime?!\n\n\"Anon?\" I snap out of my trance. I must've been mumbling again, of course I'd do that. Before Stella can continue, I let my confusion take over.\n\"Why are you guys acting like I grew wings? What the heck is The World?\"\n\nStella immediately jumps back into her excitement, eager to explain the meaning behind this supposedly important card. \"Anon, this is incredible! I couldn't have ever imagined pulling this card!\" Damnit, just tell me what it means already you glorified Geico lizard! \"This means that your future is full of endless opportunity! You will come home reaping the rewards you deserve from the challenges you face! The universe will smile upon you as you conquer your trials and tribulations! Your hard work will lead to a nirvana, and you will swim in an ocean of completion and happiness! There is only light at the end of the tunnel, and you are set for no less than absolute success!\"\n\n...Wow! If I didn't have any motivation before, I sure as hell do now! Apparently, this is one of if not the best card in the deck! I don't care if I wasn't too big on this kind of stuff before, this gives me real hope for what's ahead. Stella thinks so too, as she's the 6th person to obliterate my back. She's practically jumping out of her skin as she enfolds me into her hug. If I didn't know any better, I'd say she was excited about me leaving!\n\n\"Oh oh oh, I can't wait for you to come back Anon! I'll send you OST's for you to listen to, and I'll give you a reading any time you need one! If you ever need to, just give me a nightcall and tell me how you feel, 'kay?\"\n\nDid she seriously just-\n\nShe backs up, giving me the most genuine smile I've seen before I can process her Drive reference. If anybody could find the good in an undesirable situation, it would be Stella. I'll definitely need your enthusiasm while I'm gone.\n\nA loud horn blares from the outside, signaling that my time has come. It looks like that our times together have come to an end, with us to be split apart for a long four years. Here it is. The Apex. The Climax. The culmination of all of the memories made with these incredible technicolor morons. It's time to play my requiem for our time cut so short. Walking to the doors, I take a long look at everyone before me.\n\n\"Fellas, it's been one hell of a journey. You all have been nothing short of the best, and I would do anything just to spend 5 more minutes with you all. Even though I may be going somewhere else for the time being, this isn't our last time together. You all still have each other to look out for, to enjoy company with. While I'm gone, go on that adventure you've always wanted to. Write down that story you've had in the back of your mind. Compose the song you've sung countless times. No matter what you do, keep moving forward. Our time together may be coming to a halt, but not to an end...\"\n\"...because true friendships never end.\"\n\nI whisper to myself so no one else can hear this last part. \"And this goes for you, too.\"\n\nThe car outside honks again, letting me know that I'm overstaying my welcome. I take a last look at everyone, one by one, and then stop at the beautiful pterosaur in the front.\n\n\"Goodbye, everyone. I'll see you on the flipside.\"\n\nI open the doors and the warm air hits my back. I make sure to have everyone's last memory of me be a good one with a smile. With that, I walk down the steps as the next chapter of my life starts with the shut of the school's front doors.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGoodbye, \/trash\/ sticky. You all have inspired me to do incredible things, and you will always be remembered.

Almost.  There was one person that was aware of her powers, but she didn\u2019t fully comprehend the extent of what she could do.  However, on this fateful day, others would finally realize what she could really do.  \n\tThe cheerful Rosa was having a pretty good day at school.  She had passed the test she was worried about and spring break was about to start.  However, she noticed that her stegosaurus friend was not present.  \u201cIs she sick?  I wonder what\u2019s up with her?  Haven\u2019t heard anything from her for 2 days now.\u201d  As sixth period ended, she got a text message on her phone.  \u201cI have something amazing to show you, friend!  Come by my house after school. ~ Stella-Chan\u201d  Rosa was shocked to see such a message out of the blue, so she responded back immediately.  \u201cWhere have you been?  And you know I have to tend the garden.  I really don\u2019t want to leave early, but\u2026 are you okay?\u201d  A few seconds later, she got a reply.  \u201cI\u2019m doing better than ever.  Trust me when I say that this is even more important than the garden.  You won\u2019t regret it when you finally come by. ^_^ ~ Stella-Chan\u201d  Rosa wasn\u2019t the type to shirk on her responsibilities, but she loved her friend.  If there was anything she could do to help her, she would.  Luckily, Stella\u2019s home was within walking distance of Volcano High, so the journey was not difficult, even for a husky triceratops.  \u201cThat Stella is one funny chica.  She\u2019s gone for 2 days, then invites me over for a surprise?  Sometimes I just don\u2019t get her.\u201d  As she reached the front door, she knocked and waited for a response.  After a few seconds of waiting, nothing happened.  \u201c\u00bfPero por qu\u00e9?  She invited me over.  What\u2019s going on.  I wonder if\u2026.\u201d  Rosa then grabbed the handle and realized it wasn\u2019t locked.  Entering the house, she noticed that the front room was dark and empty.  She had been there before, but it never looked this abandoned.  \u201cHer parents aren\u2019t home either?  I guess they\u2019re at work now.  I bet she\u2019s in her room.\u201d  Heading towards Stella\u2019s room, Rosa heard the faint sound of music in the background with Stella singing.  \u201cDakedo yappari.... kininaru\u2026\u201d Rosa giggled.  \u201cMore of her Japon\u00e9s karaoke?  Heh, I guess she wanted to show me her new song and was too busy practicing to hear me.\u201d  Relieved that her friend was okay, Rosa opened the door.\n\tStella was incredibly excited to see her friend.  \u201cUwaa!  It\u2019s Rosa.  Okaeri nassai!  I\u2019ve been waiting on you~~~\u201d As the triceratops saw the cheerful girl, she was happy at first, then grew concerned.  \u201cWait\u2026 if you\u2019re not sick, why did you miss 2 days of school?  All of this for your knew song?\u201d  Stella laughed at the incorrect deduction.  \u201cOhohoho\u2026 it\u2019s not just the song.  I was working on a special project.  I learned a new magical technique and it will change everything.\u201d  Rosa frowned.  \u201cMore of your black magic?  You need to be careful with that kind of thing.\u201d  A smile grew across Stella\u2019s face.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this spell will help people.  Allow me to explain.  You know what season it is, right?\u201d  Rosa looked confused.  \u201cUh\u2026 spring, but what does that have to do with anything?\u201d  Stella shook her head.  \u201cClose, but that\u2019s not what I meant.  It\u2019s\u2026. Estrus season!  And you always look so lonely working in the garden.  So I got an idea.  After researching some more powerful techniques, I can solve your lack of a mate.\u201d  Rosa laughed.  \u201cSo you spent all this time trying to find me a boyfriend?  That\u2019s nice, but\u2026\u201d  Stella wagged her finger.  \u201cNo, something even better.  The solution was in front of you all along.  Check this out!  Dai Henshin!\u201d  With that cheerful declaration, Stella spun around.  During the spin, she took off her shorts and revealed her underwear to her friend.  Rosa was confused and a little uncomfortable as she saw the girl spinning in place to undress.  \u201cStella.  I\u2019m going to be serious for a bit.  I may not have a boyfriend, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I want a girlfri-\u201d before she could finish her thoughts, she noticed something important.  As Stella stopped spinning once the sequence was over and returned to standing still, Rosa finally saw the bulge in her striped blue panties.  \u201cOh\u2026. What in God\u2019s name is that huge thing!?\u201d  Stella raised a finger to the air and started spinning it.  \u201cPi puri pi puri pa pe po!  That\u2019s the magic spell to become the Rebis; the Divine hermaphrodite.  I saw it in a doujinshi and thought that it might work in real life, too.  I was a little worried at first, but I consulted my deck and drew this.\u201d  From between her breasts, she pulled out a card.  \u201cArcana Number 1: The Magus.  It represents incredible potential.  With that being revealed to me, I knew I had to try it.\u201d  Rosa\u2019s eyes widened in shock.  \u201cYou just\u2026 kept that card in your bosom?  I don\u2019t remember you being this\u2026 naughty.\u201d  Stella looked down at Rosa\u2019s thighs and began to shudder with lust.  \u201cThe spell\u2026 changed a lot of things.  I\u2019ve always liked you, but we might as well make it official now.  After all, aren\u2019t we the best of friends?\u201d   Rosa backed away from the horny stegosaurus.  \u201cIt\u2019s just not right.  Two women can\u2019t be together.  That\u2019s an abomination!\u201d  Stella then pulled down her panties, revealing her massive reptilian cock.  \u201cBut that\u2019s the thing.  I\u2019m not exactly a woman anymore.  I\u2019m what some would call\u2026 a futanari.  It\u2019s like Viper GTS.  The angels were futanari.  You like angels, right?\u201d  Rosa looked very annoyed at that comment.  \u201cYou know, statements like that are not really helping your argument.  Some of your hobbies are a little worri-\u201d  While Rosa was reacting to the remark, the scent of pheromones began to spread through the room.  The unique musk of Stella\u2019s genitals entered her friend\u2019s nostrils and something changed.  The triceratops stopped talking and began to feel a heat within her loins.  She saw the glistening shine of her friend\u2019s penis and couldn\u2019t ignore it.  Licking her lips, she stopped walking backwards in an attempt to escape and just sat still looking at her instead.  Stella let out a giggle.  \u201cThink of it like this.  A woman can\u2019t fertilize you, but I could if I wanted to.  So it\u2019s just like being with a man, right?  You\u2019ll get all of the love and affection from your best friend and maybe even kids one day.  Isn\u2019t that what you want?\u201d  Rosa looked sad for a second, but then began to think.  Guys weren\u2019t really interested in her since she spent so much time gardening.  She had been feeling horny because of the Estrus season, but tried to ignore it, abstaining from sexual thoughts via prayer.  However, bearing witness to a dick staring her in the face, she couldn\u2019t help but have her urges return.  \u201cAy, dios mio\u2026 perd\u00f3name\u2026\u201d  She removed the crucifix from around her neck and put it in her pocket.  \u201cSo\u2026 how does this even work?  I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d  Stella walked towards Rosa and placed a hand on her face.  \u201cDon\u2019t look so sad.  I\u2019ve read enough books to know the basics.  First, take off your shirt and pants.\u201d  Rosa accepted her words and began to undress.  No one had ever seen her like this before, so she couldn\u2019t help but blush.  Stella began to look up and down her body.  \u201cOoh, very nice.  Black panties.  Not as sexy as my shimapan, but still pretty good.  Your boobs look a lot bigger like this, too.\u201d  Rosa\u2019s face became even more red from this declaration.  \u201cOh\u2026. Thank you.  So do I just\u2026\u201d Stella looked at the confused girl and continued rubbing her face.  \u201cSit down on the bed.\u201d  Still nervous, Rosa heeded her words and began to move towards Stella\u2019s bed.  Her gait showed that she was unsure of what was to come, but she couldn\u2019t stop now.  Her lower parts were burning with anticipation.  Stella stared at her friend\u2019s behind and started drooling.  \u201cOshiri\u2026\u201d Barely able to contain herself, Stella took off her shirt and bra.  Sitting down on the bed with Rosa, she began unhooking her bra for her.  Rosa had finally stopped looking sad.  Leaning towards her, Stella initiated a kiss.  Rosa was still a little scared, but ultimately accepted. The two locked lips and learning the taste of one another. \u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so bad, right?\u201d  Rosa\u2019s mood suddenly changed once the kiss registered in her mind.  \u201cY-yeah, it was actually pretty nice.  So now\u2026 can I touch it?\u201d  Rosa looked down at the throbbing member of her friend, being far more open to the concept than just a few moments earlier.  \u201cBe my guest!\u201d  With that confirmation, Rosa slowly motioned her head towards her friend\u2019s crotch.  The penis was practically staring her in the face, so she couldn\u2019t help but respond.  First, she grabbed it softly with her right hand.  Stella shuddered once more.  \u201cUoooh\u2026 that feels good.  But can you lick it?\u201d  Rosa was caught up in the moment, so she didn\u2019t even think about it.  The tip of her tongue touched the head of Stella\u2019s cock and then the triceratops was immediately hooked.  She quickly wrapped the entire length of her tongue around it and began motioning up and down while she moved her hand towards the testicles and began to lightly squeeze.  She had never felt like this before and was enamored with the taste and smell of the whole thing.  Stella jumped in place a bit.  \u201cOwo, you\u2019re good at this.  Allow me to reward you.\u201d  She then moved her hand towards Rosa\u2019s crotch.  Inserting her hand between the thick thighs of the triceratops and into her panties, she started to rub on the clitoris of her lover.  Rosa couldn\u2019t believe this feeling of ecstasy she was experiencing.  It was like nothing she ever even knew was possible.  Not thinking about it, she began to squeeze down harder on Stella\u2019s balls.  \u201cWait!  You\u2019re gonna make me squirt everywhere if you grip me like that!  Let\u2019s get to the real thing now.  Take your panties off and get on all fours.\u201d  Rosa was really into the blowjob, but listened to her friend anyway since she wanted to see what she had in mind.  Taking off her panties, she got into position for penetration.  Staring at the Mexican girl\u2019s huge ass, Stella\u2019s own pussy began to get wet as well.  Getting on her knees, she grabbed her penis with her right hand and put her left on the hip of her partner.  After having the surrounding area of her vagina rubbed by the reptilian dong, Rosa began to wiggle around a bit in place.  It tickled, but she really wanted this, so she tried her best to sit still for the insertion.  After a bit more fiddling around with the orifice, Stella finally managed to get it inside. \u201c\u00a1Ay, carajo!  It\u2019s so big!\u201d  Stella smiled \u201cWell I am the supreme magus of Volcaldera Bluffs, so this was to be expected.\u201d  Rosa sighed.  \u201cI\u2019m just going to pretend I know what you\u2019re talking about.  Anyway, just keep going.\u201d  Stella understood what her friend meant, so she grabbed both of her hips now and started thrusting in and out.  The meat of her backside kept jiggling and smacking against Stella\u2019s pelvis.  The sight of this made her even more excited than before.  Pheromones now encased the entire room.  The scent of Rosa\u2019s pussy was affecting Stella as well, so she just started pounding harder and harder.  The pair both let out yelps of pleasure as they continued.  As the excitement grew, Rosa couldn\u2019t stop fidgeting around again.  Her tail started moving around like crazy and she accidentally hit Stella in the face with it.  \u201cItai!  Careful with that!\u201d  Rosa felt her embarrassment coming back.  \u201cSorry about that!  I was just losing it from how you were making me feel.\u201d  Stella rubbed the area where she was hit, then pulled her penis out of the sopping pussy.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.  Actually, you know what?  Let\u2019s try a different position.  Get on your back and spread your legs.\u201d  Rosa, still wanting more, obeyed without question.  She got into position and began to spread her pussy with her fingers.  \u201c\u00a1Vamanos!  Let\u2019s continue!\u201d  Stella, not wanting to disappoint her, immediately jammed it in.  The second penetration left Rosa with another spark of ecstasy, so she couldn\u2019t help but pull her partner in closer.  Grabbing onto her back, Stella was right in Rosa\u2019s face now, so they shared yet another kiss.   This time, it was much more intense than before.  Rosa suddenly had her hands around the back of Stella\u2019s head so she couldn\u2019t escape.  Their tongues were daring back and forth between each others\u2019 mouths and neither of them could stop.  This is all while Stella continued to move her lower half violently, becoming drunk on the juices of both her friend\u2019s upper and lower mouths.  Stella also experienced the aftertaste of her cock juices from the tongue of her partner.  At this point, she was going nuts from her own pheromones, even.  This ecstasy pushed her to thrust even harder.  Rosa didn\u2019t want the feeling to end, so she wrapped her legs around Stella, locking her into place.  Anyone that could view this would be in awe of the Stegosaurus\u2019 smaller, but perky bottom shaking as her pelvis kept smacking against the soft, tender thighs of her partner as they shook from the impact.  Rosa felt like she was about to pass out, however, so the triceratops was forced to finally release Stella from her grip and get some air.  Now breathing heavily, she could hardly think.  Stella had a look of pure lust on her face, as if her pupils were becoming like hearts.  \u201cMy hips are moving on their own!  Hehehe\u2026.\u201d  She always wanted to say that.  Grabbing onto the breasts of her partner, she gave them a good squeeze as milk began to leak from them, followed by Rosa yelping louder than before.  \u201c\u00a1Te quiero!\u201d  Rosa was usually a good girl.  She didn\u2019t even masturbate, so this kind of pleasure was unknown to her.  As such, she didn\u2019t realize that she having an orgasm, as she didn\u2019t really know what an orgasm was.  Her vagina began to squirt fluid everywhere, showering Stella\u2019s member with a heat and wetness that she didn\u2019t know was possible as she was being squeezed by the walls to an absurd degree.  \u201cI-iku!  Nakadashi!!!!\u201d  As Stella yelled out more of the words she learned from her doujinshi collection, she began to shudder harder than ever before.  She did one last long thrust to put herself balls deep inside of Rosa, rubbing against her cervix.  Her dick began twitching, then she unleashed the deluge of semen.  The output was massive, to the point that it started leaking from the sides before Stella could even pull out.  As the ejaculation ended, Stella finally removed her penis from the orifice and laid next to her partner.  Rosa moaned as the excess semen gushed out, as her insides were absolutely caked with white fluid.  \u201cWow\u2026 that was not the kind of surprise I was expecting, Stella.  But I must say, that was really nice.\u201d  Her friend giggled at the comment.  \u201cThanks.  You were pretty good, too.  I was going nuts waiting on you, so I\u2019m glad you came.\u201d  With that comment, Stella burst out laughing.  Rosa looked confused.  \u201cI don\u2019t get it, what\u2019s so funny?\u201d  Stella leaned over towards her lover and patted her head.  \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.  Anyway, this bed is a mess now.\u201d  The pair looked down at the sheets.  Their juices had covered the bed.  White and clear fluid had pooled all around the area and was seeping into the mattress.  Rosa perked up.  \u201cWow, that\u2019s a lot of stuff.  So, do you think I\u2019m gonna\u2026. Have babies?\u201d  Stella nodded.  \u201cWith my powerful magic, I\u2019m almost sure of it.  I think you\u2019ll make a great mommy, too.  You already have the body for it.\u201d  Rosa blushed.  \u201cStop it, you\u2019re embarrassing me\u2026\u201d  Her friend let out another laugh.  \u201cOh, I get it.  That\u2019s pretty funny.  Embarrassing?  Like embarassada?  I remember you taught me that word!  See, you\u2019re funny, too.\u201d  She rolled her eyes.  \u201cEhh, close enough.  But how is this gonna work out?  So you\u2019re mama number 2?  What are we going to tell people?\u201d  Stella put her hand on her chin and thought for a second.  \u201cWell I don\u2019t think it matters too much what people think.  You and I aren\u2019t really that popular to begin with and our friends will still like us, I bet.  As long as we have a healthy child and raise them with lots of love and affection, that\u2019s all that really matters, right?\u201d  Rosa nodded in approval.  \u201cI guess so.  But let\u2019s worry about that later.  How about we enjoy spring break together\u2026. As a couple!\u201d  Stella sprang up in excitement at the statement.  \u201cSure thing, girlfriend!  But let\u2019s get cleaned up first.\u201d  \n\tA week later, school started back up.  The two dinosaurs walked back into Volcano High together, holding hands.  Rosa was a little scared of doing this at first, but Stella helped her practice.  \u201cSee, I told you.  No one cares.  It\u2019s just like Koakuma Kanojo!\u201d Rosa nodded, trying to focus on looking forward.  \u201cIf you say so.  Oh look, there\u2019s Anon.  He\u2019s headed this way.  What should we do?\u201d  Stella looked at her lovingly and said \u201cWell I actually do want to show him something.\u201d  As the pair approached the person in question, Stella stopped him.  \u201cHi, Anon.  How was your break?  Did it go like I told you I predicted it would a while back?  With the new shoes?\u201d  Anon looked down and remembered that he did in fact get new shoes.  \u201cWell yeah, but my old ones were kind of beat up to begin with.  I never got why you thought that drawing your Pocket Raptor would let you do mag-\u201d He suddenly noticed how big Rosa\u2019s stomach was.  He remember her being a little chubby, but not like this.  \u201cUh\u2026 is everything alright with you two?\u201d  Stella began to laugh.  \u201cOhohohoho.  You doubted my potency, but now I\u2019ve proven it in more ways than one.  I got Rosa pregnant!  She\u2019s going to have my baby soon.  We did it over spring break after I performed a spell that granted me a futanari transformation.\u201d  Anon looked at her with a very disturbed face.  \u201cUh\u2026 Stella, I think it\u2019s time to lay off of the Chinbotsu stuff.  But still, I thought you meteo- uh\u2026. Dinos laid eggs.\u201d  Stella giggled.  \u201cWhy do you think it\u2019s called magic?  Because it\u2019s mundane?\u201d  Rosa began to blush.  \u201cSi...  She has a real way with words, so I fell in love\u2026\u201d  Anon looked even more confused since he saw Rosa indulge in Stella\u2019s antics.  \u201cRosa, you\u2019re in on this, too?  But\u2026 pregnancy doesn\u2019t show up that fast.\u201d  Stella couldn\u2019t stop laughing.  \u201cAnon, I just told you.  It\u2019s magic!  Do you finally understand?\u201d  He nodded in acceptance.  \u201cUh\u2026 yeah, alright.  Well then\u2026 have a nice day I guess.\u201d  With that said, he quickly walked away from the pair.  Rosa still looked a bit concerned.  \u201cStella\u2026 I think you scared him.\u201d  She rubbed her lover\u2019s face.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry.  He was just in awe of\u2026 the saikou no majutsushi.\u201d  Rosa began to smile.  \u201cJajaja, whatever you say\u2026.

Especially with whatever scheme Fang has concocted to make our friend group whole again. I had already talked to Trish and we were on as good of terms as can be expected between someone and the person who tried to destroy your life and make you transfer schools again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a scheme Anon, it\u2019s just planning out a time for us all to hangout that\u2019s not band related. I told you this already.\u201d Fang says this after elbowing me in the ribs. \u201cBesides you\u2019d do anything for your sweet tooth, right?\u201d she can hardly restrain a snort as she says your pet name for her.\n\nOpening the door for you qt3.14 ptero gf you catch a glimpse inside the auditorium. Reed and Trish are already inside waiting patiently. Not one to wait reed has already started wolfing down his lunch, while  Trish quickly finishes writing in her band journal before shoving it back in her backpack and pulling out her much smaller meal. \n\n\u201cSup Amigo\u201d Reed says in between bites.\n\n\u201cHey Anon\u201d Trish says meekly.\n\nEven though it\u2019s been a couple of weeks by now we still all aren\u2019t the best of terms. At this point it\u2019s mostly all water under the bridge, but Trish is still a shell of her former self. She seems confident at any moment when we\u2019re all together we are going to turn on her. I try more for Fang\u2019s sake than anything else to help bring Trish back out but so far nothings helped. That\u2019s why Fang is so adamant that this little group hang sesh happen. Fuck was I mumbling again?\n\n\u201cYou always are Dork.\u201d Fang says rolling her eyes before she takes a seat. \u201cSo with that wonderful introduction, you all know why we\u2019re here. Things have been weird and the only way to get through that is to try and get back to normal. Hangout like we used to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hang out all the time though.\u201d Trish pipes up\n\n\u201cYeah at school.\u201d Reed responds chugging what he claims to be tea.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea. We should hang out more outside of school, I mean I don\u2019t really know that many places here, but I\u2019m sure we can find someplace to\u2026\u201d and that\u2019s when I was cutoff by Fang.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you agree Anon!\u201d She says wrapping her arms around me. Everything about this starts alarms off in my head. Oh god wherever this is going it can\u2019t be good. She would never try to butter me up unless\u2026\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to do a movie marathon at your place Anon!\u201d Fang says excitedly rubbing her hands down my chest as she holds me. \n\nThe lizard brain responds immediately to all of this attention, but I\u2019m brought back to reality by Trish.\n\n\u201cA...Anons\u2019 place?! In Skin rows?!\u201d Trish almost shouts. Finally a spark of her old self returning.\n\n\u201cYeah I don\u2019t know how good of an idea that is Fang.\u201d Reed slowly drawls\n\n\u201cOh come on. I\u2019ve been there before it wasn\u2019t that bad, plus Anon is the only one who lives by himself.\u201d Fang says glancing back and forth between her two best friends. Suddenly her eyebrow raises  turning her face from one of stone cold seriousness to mischief.  \u201cWe won\u2019t have to deal with anyone. No Parents, and more importantly no Naomi.\u201d \n\nBoth Trish and Reed visibly perk up upon hearing that. A chance to hang out without having to deal with her is a rare opportunity. \n\n\u201cI mean\u201d fang almost whispers into my ears \u201cAs long as that\u2019s ok with you Anon\u2026\u201d as she says this she rests her head on my shoulder and rubs her face against mine. Again the lizard takes over and I shift my bag over the front of my pants.\n\n\u201cYeah I mean my place is usually pretty quiet. We shouldn\u2019t have anything to worry about.\u201d I chuckle maybe more nervously than I wanted.\n\n\u201cYAY!\u201d fang jumped up from her seat tail swinging side to side \u201cSo what movies should we marathon then?\u201d\n\nThe discussion lightened up as we began discussing what we should watch. We argued mostly playfully with a few flare ups now and again, but eventually we came to a decision. With that out of the way we moved onto the rest of the planning all uneventful until we got to how we were going to get the movies.\n\n\u201cYou can get them for us right Anon\u201d Fang asks me.\n\nSteeling myself and gritting my teeth slightly \u201cNo I can\u2019t if you recall I\u2019m banned from the school internet for some reason.\u201d it took all of my power to not glare at Trish as I say this. Before anyone else can speak trying to smooth over that incident I quickly add \u201cBut Reed is great with all that stuff like wires, and electronics. I\u2019m sure he can do it.\u201d\n\nReed barely notices me roping him into this. Whatever he had taken clearly already affecting his system. \u201cWhuzzat..?\u201d he finally adds\n\n\u201cReed you can download these for us can\u2019t you\u201d Fang asks almost too sweetly.\n\n\u201cYeah of course. Can\u2019t see how that would be a problem.\u201d he responds staring off into space.\n\nFriday rolls around and another uneventful day of school crawls by. At this point few people even bother to try and make fun of me anymore, the school has already moved on to newer drama. Walking down towards the front of the school to meet with the rest of the gang I almost literally run into Reed.\n\n\u201cOh heeey Anon. Man glad I found you. I have some uh\u2026\u201d he paused uncomfortably long lost in thought \u201cbusiness that needs to be taken care of.\u201d He opens his bag and starts rooting through it. The clink of glass is heard as he digs, and was that a flash of metal? Are those Latex gloves?\n\n\u201cHey man no need to worry it\u2019s all part of the business you know?\u201d he says finally finding the object he wanted. He holds a usb out to me that I take and shove into my pocket. \u201cIt has all of the movies we discussed, with two versions of that one Trish wanted. Original audio and dubbed, but yeah tell the girls I\u2019m sorry I have to ditch, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re used to it by now.\u201d\nInitially this worried me greatly. Did Fang set this whole thing up just to get us with Trish so we could work things out, or did Reed really have something come up. Thinking back to his last comment and the short time I\u2019ve known him it didn\u2019t seem that out of the realm of possibilities. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s forgotten to even show up to band practice. Still I couldn\u2019t help but keep the thought in the back of my mind that this was a setup. Trish and Fang are standing in almost the exact spot where I first spotted them all those weeks ago. Little did I know then she would become the most important thing in my life. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m still going through with all of this I chuckle to myself.\n\n\u201cCome on Skinnie we\u2019re waiting.\u201dTrish says tapping her foot in impatience \u201cAnd where is Reed?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah I just ran into him. He said he had something he needed to take care of, and that he was going to have to bail.\u201d I say reaching into my pocket, \u201cbut at least he gave me the movies so we can still do this. If y\u2019all want to reschedule though that\u2019s fine\u201d I try not to sound too hopeful with that last part.\n\n\u201cI mean if\u201d Trish starts before being immediately cut off by Fang.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re still going to do it, right? Besides we already have everything and I\u2019ve been looking forward to this all week!\u201d Fang pleads.\n\nTrish looks at Fang and then at me and shrugs \u201cAlright fine, but how are we going to get there?\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t believe we hadn\u2019t actually thought of this before now. Fang nervously starts glancing at her phone, probably debating if she should even ask Naser. Now it\u2019s my turn to step up for Fang.\n\n\u201cNo worries I got a guy\u201d I say walking down the stairs. As we reach the bottom I pull out my phone to make a familiar call, but already has pulled up and the window rolls down.\n\n\u201cYou know the rule Kid. I can get you close but no further.\u201d the cabbie says.\n\nTrish and Fang both look at me quizzically, but I have already reached to open the door for them.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s cool I promise\u201d and with this bit of encouragement the girls shuffle into the back. I slide in after them, and notice only after closing the door that Trish has the bitch seat. A seating arrangement that under normal circumstances would be uncomfortable now becomes awkward. As we speed off I start to speak up but before the words can form in my mouth mouth Trish beats me to it.\n\n\u201cFang don\u2019t you want to sit next to Anon?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cYou know the middle seat makes me sick Trish, besides it\u2019s not that far of a ride you all can play nice for it. That\u2019s the whole point of this remember?\u201d she says turning her attention back outside.\n\nIt\u2019s not like this is easy for me either Trigger. You\u2019re the reason we\u2019re in this situation to begin with. It was easier when you just hated me, instead of this awkward back and forth. As I finish this thought I see the cabbies eye shift from the rear view mirror back to the road. Shit\u2026\n\n\u201cYeah \u2018shit\u2019 is right you fucking ass!\u201d Trish practically shouts in my ear. She stomps on my foot clearly pretending she was simply shifting her seating position \u201cYou think I\u2019m excited about this? About spending god knows how many hours with you two lovebirds without even having Reed to talk to. What am I supposed to do? Sit alone and try to watch the shitty movie you picked out while you two make out?!\u201d\n\nFang ever the peacemaker now reaches a hand out and places it on Trish\u2019s shoulder. \n\n\u201cCome on\u2026\u201d she pleads with Trish \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be like that. That\u2019s not what today was supposed to be about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmph.\u201dTrish pouts. Not being able to look in either direction she simply stares down at her boots. \u201cFine, but we get to watch my movie first.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah I forgot to mention. Reed downloaded both versions. Do you want subbed or dubbed Trish?\u201d I ask her trying my best to sound sincere.\n\n\u201cSubbed of course you fa..\u201d her response is cut short as the cab slams on it breaks and turns 180 degrees to perfectly parallel park.\n\n\u201cYou know how it goes kid. No Further.\u201d he says not even bothering to look back at us.\n\n\u201cOf course. I appreciate it.\u201d I say exiting the vehicle and helping the girls out. Trish initially recoils at my hand but her boot gets stuck while she\u2019s climbing out and has to use my arm to pull herself out. As she does she falls into my arms. Several emotions cross her face before she pushes away and starts dusting herself off.\n\n\u201cThanks again\u201d I say leaning into the open window to hand him his fair.\n\n\u201cI drive people to their destinations. That\u2019s who I am.\u201d he says calmly before slamming his foot on the gas and peeling out from the spot perfectly into traffic.\n\n\u201cSo Skinnie how long do we have to go from here?\u201d Trish\u2019s mood seems to have perked up. Possibly due to impending violence she might get to inflict on some poor Skinnie who looks at her the wrong way.\n\nThe walk to the apartment is completely uneventful. We basically saw no one at all. Trish seemed slightly upset by this, but didn\u2019t mention it. Unlocking the door to my apartment Fang immediately makes herself at home and starts microwaving some nuggies and pulls out enough popcorn to feed an army. Trish awkwardly stands near the door, not even letting her bag touch the ground.\n\n\u201cYou can throw that bag anywhere\u201d I say to her over my shoulder as I hook my rig up to the TV.\n\n\u201cNo that\u2019s ok. I\u2019d rather hold onto it. If that\u2019s ok\u2026\u201d she looks at fang as she says this. A little odd, but I guess to her it\u2019s as much Fang\u2019s place as it is mine.\n\nWith everything setup I start the movie. We all squeeze onto my single bed, this time at least Fang sits between us a large bowl of popcorn in her lap. The nuggets it seems had simply been a snack to stave off her hanger while she organized the rest of the food. The movie Trish had picked out at first surprised me, one of those Japanese films everyone says you should watch but few ever do. Even more she wanted to watch it in Japanese. Mulling this over I realized how little I actually knew about Trish, Reed, and even Fang. I haven\u2019t been around that long, and they\u2019ve been friends forever. Suddenly I felt very self conscious about integrating myself into this long standing friend group. Had Trish been right in the cab? Was I really in it to be friends with them, or was it just Fang? This stream of thought was broken as a handful of popcorn smacks me in the face.\n\n\u201cI was worried about you two making out the whole time, but now I\u2019m worried about you not shutting the fuck up Anon.\u201d Trish says more playfully than I expected. Shoving another handful of popcorn in her mouth. She seems to be enjoying the look of confusion on my face. \u201cCome on Anon it\u2019s a movie night. Shhh\u2026\u201d raising a finger to her mouth to emphasize her shushing. Wait did she just lick the tip? No I\u2019ve got to be imaging that.\n\n\u201cYou do mumble a lot Dweeb.\u201d Fang chides me wrapping her arms around my torso.\n\nThe movie continues but ever so slowly Fang seems to be getting herself more comfortable with me. Sliding her hand underneath my shirt to slowly stroke my chest. Eventually a hand rests itself on my crotch and give it a slow tender squeeze. She fought Trish about this, said this wasn\u2019t what was going to happen but here she is making all of the advances. I don\u2019t fight any of them, but I try not to engage with them. Was she testing me?\n\nEventually she stretches her wings out, and in doing so slides one behind me. Is that corny or what, but I don\u2019t have anymore time to think about that scenario as I suddenly feel her wrapping her wings around me. Grabbing me by my shoulders she pulls me into a deep long kiss. I am momentarily panicked, how am I supposed to handle this. Eventually my body outpaces my mind and I return the kiss. Placing a hand on her waist and raising another to stroke her face and hair as I return the favor. Suddenly a new sensation appears. A hand on my crotch? Just as it happens Fang breaks away from me. Saliva still connecting us, she pushes me gently into the wall and turns to Trish.\n\n\u201cNow now\u2026 What did we discuss earlier Trish. No touching until you show him.\u201d Fang says positioning herself on top of me.\n\n\u201cAnon\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Trish can barely spit these words out as she meekly reaches into her bag. She pulls out the notepad she\u2019s always writing in. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d she almost looks like she\u2019s going to burst into tears as she says this \u201cPlease look at my stories\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so hard was it Trish?\u201d Fang says. She quickly hops off of me, much to the irritation of my confused but raging erection.\n\nTrish hands over the notebook, and I awkwardly accept it.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this?\u201d I ask.\n\nFang looks at me as she helps Trish off the bed \u201cAt least flip through it Anon. It would be Rude not to.\u201d With that brief explanation she reaches down and starts to strip off Trish\u2019s hoodie before pulling it back down.\n\n\u201cNow Anon no peeking, you\u2019ve got your reading material.\u201d She says smirking.\n\nMind still reeling from what\u2019s going on I decide I can at least pretend to look at the notebook. The moment I open it up I am confronted with a vast world of what Trish has dubbed \u201cErotic Friend Fiction.\u201d  The first story appears to be about me\u2026 Cheating on Fang\u2026 With Stella? As if that would ever happen. A story about Trish helping me get my life together? Some of them seem rather plain, but then as it goes on they get much more erotic. With in depth descriptions about what Trish thinks sex with humans would be like, but more specifically sex with me. Suddenly a hand pulls the notebook away from me.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t actually expect you to read them dweeb.\u201d Fang says mockingly.\n\nAs I look up Fang and Trish are both standing there in almost matching lingerie. The only difference being the color. Fang\u2019s a pure white and Trish\u2019s a dark black. My mind can barely comprehend what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 Uh\u2026 Huh\u2026 Awah\u2026\u201d I manage to blurt out.\n\n\u201cOh Anon you\u2019re so cute when your dumb.\u201d Fang says crawling onto the bed. She beckons Trish over who starts to slowly strip me as Fang strokes my face with her hand.\n\n\u201cTrish and I used to\u2026 Play with each other Anon.\u201d Fang says nonchalantly \u201cYou had to guess that was at least a possibility, right? You\u2019re not that dumb.\u201d \n\nTrish takes my shirt off, and then heads down to my underwear. Fang takes this opportunity to gently bite my neck. My erection springs upward as Trish finally removes the last of my clothing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so big\u2026\u201d Trish says eyeing my cock. With this she crawls on the other side of the bed and places a hand on my testicles. Slowly rolling them back and forth in her hand.\n\n\u201cTrish and I had a conversation Anon.\u201d Fang whispers in my ear. \u201cAnd during our discussion I found out she wanted you almost as much as I do. Then I found her little smutbook.\u201d while saying this you feel her tongue gently flick your ear. \u201cBesides I\u2019m not so jealous that I wouldn\u2019t share you\u2026 especially with my best friend.\u201d she begins kissing your chest\n\n\u201cYou being friends would make me happy, Anon. You want to make me happy right?\u201d she says stroking your chest with her hand. Her nails raking dangerously across your flesh.\n\nWait was that the door?\n\n\u201cHey guys!\u201d Reed says bursting through the doorway. \u201cTurns out it didn\u2019t take as long as\u2026\u201d \nHe stops dumbfounded by the situation. In his panic he closes the door with himself still inside. Once again he glances at us and then turns slamming his head into the door. Passing out onto the floor.\n\n\u201cGod Damnit Reed.\u201d Trish sighs.","Title":"Movie Night","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Perfect Situation Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Perfect Situation Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: Perfect SItuation\nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Fang, Ripley, Trish, Tana, Reed, Stella.

The cloudy sky above mirroring the gray pavement beneath my feet did little to improve my mood, every day somehow managed to be shittier than the one before it. The only pleasure to extract from today was that the world itself seems to be having a shitty day too. I couldn't even get too excited about my upcoming dinner, my pension didn't cover many frivolities and the pizza I was about to pick up was likely to be the only one this month.\n\nI exhaled a toxic cloud of nicotine that seemed to be my only companion these past few years and stared numbly at my cigarette. Its cherry ember seemed to stare warmly back at me, the smoke caressing my face was a welcoming warmth on a cold, dreary day. I picked up my pace towards the pizzeria, I wasn't exactly certain but I'm pretty sure that humanizing my smokes was a bad sign. This pack of cigarettes represented the other half of my spending budget and I'd prefer to enjoy them properly at home rather than waste the menthol staring at like it was anything more than a ticket to a blissfully early grave.\n\nThat grave couldn't come soon enough, some would argue my life had only just started but those people were fucking idiots. By all metrics I wasted my life, I even joined the military just like all failures. Oh, everyone always joins and says that they're only using it to pay for their college but they never actually go when their service is up. Truth is, you had one shot in high school and I wasted mine. I was a loser with no friends who was publically humiliated twice over. My hands clench into fists as I recall how Trish saw fit to drag out a past best forgotten just so she could ruin my fresh start. The only solace I have thinking of Trish is that if she was stupid enough to think two bass works in a band then she was too stupid for the real world. I can feel my lips curl into a cruel smile as I think of that dumb trigger living in a trailer with three kids and no father like the welfare queen she is.\n\nThat was a comforting thought that unfortunately didn't last the full length of my walk. Without mocking the memory of Trish my mind was stuck back in the halls of volcano high. I had a great plan back then, keep my head down and get into any college that would accept me. I bet it would have worked too if I didn't get tricked into friends by Naomi, that cunt. Even despite her meddling if Reed and I never swapped backpacks then I could have ghosted the year totally fine. Without that, I never would have made any friends or gotten my heart broken on that damned beach. I sighed, it may not have been cold enough for my breath to be visible but it sure felt like it.\n\nI desperately wanted to resent Fang and her friends, especially Fang. Everyone says that high school is your golden years but it felt like I only got a few golden months. It's because those months were with them, with her, that I could never truly bring myself to hate them. My thoughts inexorably crawl their way towards the beach and I quickly lose any positive feelings I had for my old 'friends'. Thankfully I seem to have found my way here while I was lost in thought, no need to concern myself with the past when I've got pizza in the present.\n\nThe chime of the pizzeria doors was far too loud and I internally cringed as every head turned towards the door. Their glances were meaningless and slid off me almost immediately but I still hated drawing attention to myself. There was only a handful of individuals milling about thankfully, seems everyone else wanted to stay home today. Staring at the dusty tiles and peeled paint however I figured that this place may just not be that popular. I placed my order and took a seat in the least stained chair, it would have been much easier to order over the phone but staying at home for weeks with no friends meant I didn't really need to pay for an expensive phone bill.\n\nHonestly it was a small blessing and the main reason I could afford smokes at all. I sort of pitied the normies that had to waste the cash when you can do pretty much anything online these days. Unfortunately this also meant that outside of my home I was bereft of the internet I had grown so accustomed too, quickly growing bored I found myself people watching. That too proved boring beyond a young couple were busy trying to eat each others face rather than their pizza and that was more gross than interesting. My eyes eventually wandered towards the stage and I had to double check that I was awake because a ghost from my past had found her way back to me.\n\nI didn't even consider, didn't even think that the ptero girl on stage could have possibly been her. Fang left my life years ago, she was supposed to have moved on, she was supposed to have made it. She wasn't supposed to have shaved her head, she wasn't supposed to be playing bass and she definitely wasn't supposed to have that same look in her eyes that I saw every morning in the mirror. Watching her strum that bass was painfully nostalgic, forcing memories of a time I had done my best to put behind me. Memories of the woman on stage looking much happier than she did now. Fang kept her gaze pointedly low almost as if the little energy left within her was spent not staring at anyone or anything.\n\nIt was fang's eyes that I couldn't look away from, those amber diamonds that sparkled in the moonlight all those years ago seemed to have lost their luster beneath haphazardly applied eyeshadow. A dark demon within me whispered that this was a good thing, that she ended up just as fucked as I was, that it was okay my life was shit because so was hers, that I had clearly dodged a bullet. It was a demon I entertained only briefly because once her song ended those dull orange eyes looked up and caught mine.\n\nIn that moment I'm paralyzed and panicked thoughts flicker through my mind, why now? What do I say? What will she say? Ultimately I'm not certain whether she would even recognize me or if I actually want her to. Fang stands however and as those pools of citrine sharpen I'm starting to think that what I want doesn't matter; especially when she's stomping over to me with purpose, her wings flaring. Those tired eyes of hers are suddenly holding an intensity that's simultaneously terrifying and to a small part of me that's still hopeful, relieving. On stage she reminded me of a marionette without its strings but now her furrowed brows, ruffled feathers and bared teeth promised a fire and brimstone that was apocalyptic. All I could do was sit numbly in my seat and watch this wrathful angel descend on me.\n\n\"You've got a lot of nerve coming back here you piece of shit\" she growled at me in a scarily accurate impersonation of her father.\n\nI opened my mouth to respond but she clearly wasn't interested in anything I had to say and continued before I could organize my thoughts.\n\n\"What, wasn't ruining my life once enough for you? You cut me off from my friends, you broke my heart and you didn't even TRY to apologize!\" her voice cracked from long suppressed emotion.\n\n\"I couldn't study, I didn't go to college, Dad kicked me out to help pay for fucking Naser's medical college because of fucking course he would.\" She was looming over me now, jabbing a pointed black nail into my chest with enough force that threatened to draw blood.\n\n\"And you! You fucking left for god knows where to be some stupid fucking jarhead! You look like shit! You smell like ash and old take-out, you should have fucking died because then at least you'd be doing us and the rest of the god damn country a service!\"\n\nHer voice had gradually elevated until she was shouting and both her talon and her tirade pushed me further back into my seat. That last one had cut particularly deep and as soon she gave me the chance to recover I found that the emptiness in my chest was ignited with an old and familiar fury. Feeling anything, even anger was exhilarating and as I looked back up at this fucking loser, this washed up gender anomaly suddenly acting high and mighty I narrowed my eyes to match hers. My lips curling back into a snarl of my own as the venom rose in my throat just begging to unleashed.\n\nExcept as I stared into those same eyes with that same anger in my breast I realized that I had been here before. For a brief moment the dim light and stuffy atmosphere of the pizzeria faded to the crisp, salty sea air of the night where I made the biggest mistake of my life. That brief moment was all it took for my vitriol to fade and I slumped back in my chair, breaking eye contact with her to rub my temple as I gathered my thoughts. It didn't take long for me to reach a conclusion and as I met her gaze with my own I could see she was still furious.\n\n\"You're right\" was all I could mumble, I had thought about how this would go down if it ever happened but all those preparations withered and were forgotten in the moment.\n\nFang was halfway to launching another diatribe when she actually registered what I said, looking back at me with something other than anger for once, confusion. In the brief reprieve that was granted me, I glanced around at the rest of the pizzeria and unsurprisingly every eye was on us, god what I wouldn't give to get out of here. Almost as if answering my prayers the cashier dropped my pizza on the table, they were probably just waiting to see if it was safe after Fang blew up at me.\n\nLooking at the woman in question I cant help but wonder if this might go somewhere, if we could forgive ourselves and start over despite all that's happened. Fang looks like she's recovering from my half-assed-sort-of apology and my sore chest throbs in anticipation of yet more shouting and poking. This is likely the last time we'll see each other ever again, the last time I'll be able to say anything to Fang and my mind is nothing but an unhelpful fuzz that's too used to only playing video games. Shit! What do I say? What do I do?\n\n\"Makeituptoyouoverpizza?\" I practically stumble over my words and gesture to the fresh pies brought to my table, I can no longer meet her gaze after that embarrassing display and I mentally kick myself for coming up with nothing better. God damnit, how do those anime characters always have the perfect thing to say? A harsh bark makes me look back however and her face is screwed up somewhere between a smile and a scowl, is she laughing at me? It's not a good laugh, it's mocking and cruel and the loathing with which she levels at me cuts at my chest worse than an actual blade. That wasn't an exaggeration, I know how that feels from experience.\n\nWhen Fang spoke her voice was incredulous and laced with venom despite her chuckling \"Did.. Did you actually just ask me out for pizza after everything? This isn't dino-moe's and we're not teenagers anymore, I'd never-\"\n\nFang's own stomach interrupted her off with a vicious rumbling that brooked no argument. Despite the rage never leaving her face, her body seems to have betrayed any argument she could make. She still looked like she was about to bite my head off but through her narrowed eyes I could see she was glancing down at the pizza, the smell of food was getting to her.\n\n\"Fine, but just because playing in here makes you crave pizza\" She grumbled, her voice a quiet rasp soaked with vitriol.\n\nShe sat down hesitantly as if the mere idea of eating with me was some kind of ordeal. Once she did however, I noticed that for as much as she mocked me for smelling like an ash-tray she wasn't any better. I was surprised to see her accept my offer over an empty stomach but I wasn't about to question my good fortune. Fang stiffly grabbed a slice and took a single measured bite, that one bite rapidly turned into two then three and soon the slice was gone. She already had a second one in hand and was attacking it with renewed ferocity, this was far beyond just enjoying pizza. Peering closer I realized something, Fang was always thin but she looked little better than skeletal now. Those once beautiful blue-gray feathers had become faded and bristly, clearly they weren't well maintained. Combined with the bags under her eyes, the dark make-up she wore, and the lack of hair it made her look like the walking dead.\n\nI can't just watch her, I should say something, but what? What do you say to somebody who hates your guts? What do you say to someone you haven't seen in years, what do you say to someone that doesn't even want to look at you? I sigh and fish around for my smokes. No smoking sign be damned I've never needed one more than right now. As soon as my lighter clicks and as I take my first drag the cigarette is suddenly snatched from my lips and my head whips over to the perpetrator. Fang inhales sharply on the menthol as if it was the last she'd ever have before blowing the smoke cloud my way.\n\n\"Don't think I've forgotten how many you bummed off me back in school, you owe me now.\" She grumbled between a mouthful of pizza and the cigarette between her lips.\n\nI can only sigh, I'll have to ration the rest of the pack if I want to make it to the next one and I was craving the soothing nicotine now more than ever. Grabbing the last two slices of the pizza before Fang can make those disappear as well we go back to our silence, It's not a comfortable silence and despite the words shared the tension is still thick with neither of us really wanting to look at each other. Eventually, there's no pizza left to distract her but she seems quite content to savor the shitty cigarette like it wasn't the cheapest brand I could find. I was still at a loss for words and a little hungry myself so I contented myself to the slices I had saved. Our impasse was broken by the manager of the pizzeria shouting at Fang that her... \"Their\" lunch break was over and Fang stood up without a word. Shit! This was supposed to be a moment, this was supposed to be where I take it all back!\n\n\"Fang.. Wait!\" I shout to her, standing up as well.\n\nPerhaps I had earned some favor with her or perhaps it was just the urgency in my voice but she stopped. She still didn't turn to look at me but bless Raptor Jesus on his cross of rock, she stopped.\n\n\"I.. I have to tell you that the night on the beach was the worst mistake of my life, that I'd take it all back if I could! That.. That I'm sorry.\"\n\nI could only hope she would believe me because I couldn't think of anything more poignant than that. I'd spent many nights arguing with myself about how I felt, about who's fault it was and at long last, I could finally tell her and we could move on together. Fang however still stood there, she didn't turn back and embrace me with her own confessions nor did her shoulders shudder with heartfelt tears. The moment stretched on as both of us stood there with neither one of us willing to say anymore, maybe we were just daring each other to walk away so we could both return to our solitary lives. At long last, however, Fang spoke though whatever emotion she hid in her barely audible whisper was impossible to make out.\n\n\"You're sorry?\"\n\nHope blossomed in my chest and I smiled, nodding eagerly despite her back still being turned to me.\n\n\"I never meant it\" I affirmed, utterly relieved.\n\n\"You're sorry.\" She repeated as if she was still feeling the words out.\n\nFang turned to face me and my relief proved short-lived. Rather than the elated girl I had hoped to see, she instead greeted me with a sneer.\n\n\"You're sorry!? NOW you're sorry!?\" She slammed a fist on the table, spitting out her next words through clenched teeth \"You had YEARS to say you're sorry. You never meant it? Why did you wait until NOW to say that!?\"\n\n\"I..\" My voice died, her intensity overwhelming any defense I could muster.\n\n\"If you never meant it, you wouldn't have left me\" her voice was losing strength but her glare hadn't \"so don't you dare try and take it back now.\"\n\nThis had become a disaster, I had to say something now or it would be all over.\n\n\"It's never too late for an apology, Fang.\" I retorted weakly, unsure if I even believed myself.\n\n\"It IS too late, the Fang you're apologizing to is gone\" She rubbed one of the tattoos on her shoulder \"You might be the same asshole from high school but I'm different now.\"\n\nShe didn't sound very confident about that, the anger was rapidly fading from her. She just looked... Tired.\n\n\"What about new Fang then? Would she accept my apology?\" I asked desperately for something, anything!\n\nFang flinched and I realized my error far too late.\n\n\"Goodbye, Anon.\"\n\nShe walked back to her bandmates with bass in hand and out of my life once again. That was it then? No storybook moment or tearful confession for a guy like me. I turned heel and walked briskly out the door leaving a few crumpled bills on the table. That was foolish, I was an idiot for thinking this would be anything more than it was. My cheeks were flushed with anger and shame, I can't believe I embarrassed myself publicly like that. To make it worse I just tossed what little spare money I had praying for catharsis and only ended up feeling worse than ever. I kicked a stray rock that dared to be in my way and hurried back home to my sanctuary where I could forget all about the outside world for a little while.\n\nFortunately, people moved out of my way, no one wants to be around an angry skinnie on skin row after all and I was just looking for something to lash out at. The anger warmed me on the walk home but, as I neared my shitty apartment I could feel it cool, this was my fault yet again. I had read one too many stories, played one too many visual novels, and somehow got it into my head that things could be different, that I could dare to hope. Pushing open the door to my home and being embraced by the familiar smells of old food and cigarette smoke I could only laugh at the idea, it was a bitter laugh but an earnest one. I shut the door with a bit more force than I intended and flipped open my shitty laptop. a little shitposting will help me relax and forget the one cold truth in this world, people don't change.","Title":"Perfect SItuation","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Fang, Ripley, Trish, Tana, Reed, Stella.

Staying cooped up any longer threatens to undo all the muscle mass I suffered to attain in the navy. Closing my eyes I started rubbing the soreness in them away, the pale blue light from the laptop screen was still burned into my retina. Standing up from my well worn chair I stretch away the aches that six hours of motionless shitposting earns you. Glancing briefly at the assorted plates, cups and boxes of trash that have piled up around my rather pathetic battlestation. A voice in the back of my mind is telling me that I should move some of it to the trash, I'm getting up anyways so I might as well right? However I just turn away from the mess, what was the point of cleaning up when no one but me was going to see it anyways? Staggering over some long forgotten trash that had apparently fallen to the floor I make my way to the kitchen to inspect what little remains in the fridge.\n\nSalami, half a jar of tomato sauce, a packet of ramen and two eggs are all that greet me when I open the door. With a sigh I begin collecting the paltry remains and set a pot of water to boil. Staring at the water beginning to bubble I'm reminded of when I was younger, I'd get so animated talking to the invisible camera pretending that I was some foodie on YouSnoot. I can't help but chuckle at the idea as I begin dumping my ingredients into the now boiling pot. The thought still hasn't left my head however, pretending I was on YouSnoot did give me some inspiration to cook more than ramen and eggs. A long repressed urge was welling within me that would not be denied, What was the harm in acting childish now and then?\n\n\"What up, it's ya boy Anonymous back at it again with whatever this fuckin' mess is.\" I smirk at the invisible audience to my side\n\n\"Now, what you wanna do when you're depression cooking is actually have real food and ingredients in the house otherwise you end up having to get creative! What I've done here is what I like to call the ramalami special.\"\n\nMy fun was cut short by the fact that I wasn't actually cooking anything that special which didn't leave me much to comment on. Despite that I still managed to have enough fun to eat my atrocious lunch with a smile. Pushing open my door I'm greeted with the chilled coastal air that threatened to dampen my tentative good mood. Time for the cheapest method of warming up known to man and dino alike, exercise. Jogging down the street with my arms pumping and chest heaving I can't help but regret my smoking habit. More focused on the pain in my chest I didn't pay too much attention to people on the street. Running past polychromatic blurs on my way to the gym I cant help but wonder why the hell it was called skin row when we were clearly still the minority? Meteor dodgers aside it wasn't long before I was forced to slow to a walk thanks to my lungs being unable to decide whether they needed me to breath or cough more. God was I really this out of shape already? Thankfully I managed to last long enough to put the bleakness of my shitty neighborhood behind me.\n\nStaring at the building I came all this way for left me taken aback by just how impressive it was. The building was far bigger than the shitty holes in the wall that I was used to and as I peered through the huge glass windows that dominated the entrance I could see an honest to god boxing ring! This place was in my price range!? Guess people just don't use the gym much these days, can hardly blame them for that considering I wouldn't be here if my life were on track. Stepping through the door I was greeted with a thankfully warm blast of air that was tinged with the smell of sweat and the sounds of exercise. Scanning the room I was astonished at just how many people were here, damn near every machine had a colorful occupant. So much for unpopular I thought as I moved to check in, the woman at the front seemed quite surprised to see a human. The green and purple raptor who introduced herself as Sarah turned out to be very animated and immediately drowned me in questions\n\n\"Wow, did you just move here!?\"\n\n\"I read that humans were endurance hunters, you must have great stamina huh?\"\n\n\"I hear humans have a year long mating season!\"\n\n\"Are you doing anything later?\"\n\nShe kept talking but god damn this girl was way too high energy, I tuned her out almost immediately. It took a few minutes of non-commital grunts and nods before she eventually took the hint and let me sign up. She looked disappointed but I was disappointed to be here so that makes us equal, sorry toots. Walking away from the tenacious theropod it dawned on me that I didn't exactly have much to do with all of the weights taken. The only unoccupied equipment were the treadmills and I had done more than enough cardio getting here. With a sigh I realized I'd have to actually talk with people and made my way to the lat pulldown machine. Standing behind an absolute manlet of a triceratops I watched him pull some honestly impressive weights for his size, that was about what I lifted and I easily had 6 inches on this guy. Facing towards the wall he didn't seem to notice me so I cleared my throat, hoping it wouldn't be lost in the din of clanking metal and grunting men. I could have sworn I saw his head twitch a bit but he continued pumping iron so he must not have heard me.\n\n\"Hey buddy, you almost done?\" I tried my best to sound amicable and not as irritated as I was feeling.\n\nHe flinched, damn near dropped his weights in the process. Come on pal, just give up the machine so I can get out of here. It took a few moments but eventually he did the exact opposite, returning to his routine like I wasn't even there. Oh, fuck this guy! I didn't have to put up with this shit! Looking around the gym once more I hoped that somebody else had finally finished but raptor jesus did not smile down on me, per usual. My cursory glance did inform me of one thing though, that big central boxing ring was totally empty. That was certainly an idea, I could use that hand to hand training for some good after all. Maybe pounding this gym rat would help me work through some frustration? I shook the phantom image of Fang and her tired eyes from my mind and set my jaw, preparing the most authoritarian voice I could muster.\n\n\"Look, I ran the whole way here and I'd like to be done and get home before dark so unless you'd like to be my exercise in the ring I'd really appreciate-\"\n\n\"Sure.\" SHE interrupted me, this was a girl? She was fucking jacked! Now that I know it's no homo I have no shame in admitting I was mirin'\n\nI swear that voice was familiar, it niggled some long forgotten memories but remained stubbornly out of my reach. Until she turned around that is, No fucking way was this the same girl. Trish looked up at me with that unforgettable smirk, a smirk who's smug aura mocked me and informed me that I had fallen for some kind of trap. Trish stood up, taller than before but so was I, her well-defined muscles glistening in the fluorescent light. She looked me up and down, muscular arms crossed as she took in the one and only Anon Y. Mous\n\n\"You look terrible.\" she finally said, making no attempt to conceal her judgement\n\n\"You look like you changed your name to Terry, your point?\" I drawled, far too drained to put up with the bullshit of someone like Trish\n\nHer faced screwed up with an anger I was all too familiar with \"You're a real piece of shit you know that? Five whole years you've been gone and you come back a bigger asshole than ever!\"\n\n\"So are you going to let me have the machine or not?\" I replied, trying to convey just how bored I was with this conversation. Who gives a shit what Trish thinks?\n\nHer eternal smirk returned \"Oh no, you wanted to spar. I've been waiting five years to punch you in the face\"\n\nShe headed for the back where the gloves were presumably stored with her shoulders square and head held high, the absolute picture of confidence. Her self-assured stride didn't go unnoticed as a few people stopped what they were doing when she walked past, murmuring to one another. The room was suddenly alive with an energy that was absent before until it was punctuated by a shout that made its way across the room.\n\n\"Trish got a live one!\"\n\nIf I thought the room was animated before it paled in comparison to now, damn near everyone had dropped their weights and was gathering around the ring. Utterly baffled at an entire building of people suddenly invested in my fight with a girl I hadn't seen since highschool I looked at the the guy next to me dumbfounded. The.. Shark? Man in question grinned mercilessly at me from behind his sunglasses, Why the hell was he wearing those indoors anyways?\n\n\"You fucked up my man, Better not pussy out! Been a while since we got a show\" he snickered behind rows of sharp teeth.\n\nA show? Does Trish do this often?\n\n\"So uh...\" I mumble, still staring at the growing crowd \"is Trish popular around here?\"\n\nHe laughs at that \"Oh yeah, she's in here every damn day and beating up idiots like you is practically her hobby. Hell she's beaten up most of the guys here, we call her the tiny terror\" He continues laughing until he realizes what he's said \"Don't uh... Don't actually tell her we call her that.\"\n\nI can see Trish entering the ring with an extra pair of gloves around her neck, guess it's time to pay the piper. Leaving chadshark blubbering behind me I push my way past the crowd to enter my own side of the ring. Raptor jesus on his cross of rock even the receptionist is getting in on this? Sarah is practically bouncing where she stands waving and cheering for me, At least she seems earnest. Her voice is practically drowned out by everyone else jeering and laughing at the new guy about to get his shit pushed in. Well fuck those guys, I was a navy seal with 300 confirmed theoretical kills. Like hell I was going to lose to Trish of all people, stepping through the elastic bands I swaggered over to meet her in the center. Trish had clearly been working out but she didn't have actual combat experience, besides, a little muscle mass isn't going to make up for the weight and height difference. She tossed a pair of gloves at me and waited patiently as I strapped them on, that smug smile of hers never left her face.\n\n\"Any last words, skinnie?\" She asked nonchalantly while doing a few preliminary stretches\n\nFinishing the last of the straps I looked over to her, a moment I never realized that I was waiting for had been dropped right in front of me.\n\n\"Don't hate me because I'm beautiful\" I leaned forward for effect \"Triggaaaaa~\"\n\nRaising my fists for the oncoming onslaught I positively basked in the gasp of our spectators and the renewed cheers, looks like I won some favor with the crowd for that one. Surprisingly Trish didnt rush right at me or scream about words belonging to her, peeking over my mitts I can see an array of emotions flick across her face. Her confident smug was lost to absolute shock, slipped into that insensate rage that I was familiar with, then to arousal? Back to rage and finally her confident smirk surfaced once again though the smile was strained, another win for me. Trish decided against saying anything to my surprise and instead walked forward just as casually as she did when she retrieved the gloves. I could sense a danger in her stance however, this time we were in the ring and all my anime poisoned brain was good for was reminding me of a jojo meme. Well if she was just going to walk at me...\n\nI held out a gloved hand where it rested against her forehead, keeping her at arms distance and my body well away from any punches she could throw at me. Looking down at trish I adopted a smug smirk of my own\n\n\"Honestly Trish, what did you expect?\"\n\nThe next few moments were a blur, mostly because I found myself airborne without realizing how. Trish grabbed my arms one moment and the next I was on my back, Jesus that hurt. Stumbling to my feet I looked around for my opponent and caught sight of a red mass consuming my vision. Trish clocked me straight in the face with a resounding thud, did she weight that thing with rocks? The brain clattering around in my skull finally realized I was in a fight and sent adrenaline pumping through my body. She threw a second punch as I was reeling but I managed to catch her fist with my own. Squinting past the stinging in my face I defaulted into the training that was beaten into me long before Trish had her chance. I wasted no time in throwing one hell of a haymaker at her, I had to get the momentum back on my side. The tiny terror nimbly hopped back, of course she did, while I was still stuck in my follow through she darted back in to land a quick jab into my side. Painful but she didn't knock the breath out of me at least, how was she so fast? Throwing another punch, this one far more conservative proved to have the same result. I was still pushing her back though and there was nowhere to run in the ring. Jab after jab rewarded me with only the swish of air but just as I was sweating from the exertion I had finally cornered her.\n\nTime to finish this, faking with my left fist I clocked my right back for a punch that would have put my old officer to shame. As pumped with adrenaline as I was I saw it all in slow motion. Trish, faced screwed up with concentration, abused her short height and fucking ducked beneath my blow. I knew what came next but I couldn't whip my body around fast enough to stop her before she planted her fist firmly in my gut. Pain exploded from the impact and left me sputtering and choking on my own spit, gasping for air. I swung wildly, mostly as a reflex but it did succeed in getting her away from me before she could follow up and end the fight.\n\nTaking up a far more defensive stance this time I raked in ragged breaths, couldn't let her get another hit like that in or I'd be hitting the mat for sure. We watched each other for a moment, circling one another slowly with the roar of the crowd dim and distant beneath the blood roaring in my ears. I expected Trish to be mocking me the whole while, to have to put up with that smug cunt look of hers. Instead her face was stone and her eyes were calculating, she was clearly putting everything she had into this fight. Watching the girl before me, now a woman who was clearly in her element I realized something that shocked me, she was beautiful.\n\nI could feel my guard slip as I got lost in my thoughts and Trish noticed it immediately forcing me to struggle to put up a defense against her blows. Just as quick as she darted in though she retreated and we resumed pacing about like a cat and mouse. To my chagrin I didn't feel like the cat in this situation. Alright, snap out of it anon you haven't even landed one punch yet! Your pride as a man is riding on this! She's clearly experienced, I need to do something that will take her off balance. My mind flickered to fang, my stomach still roiled thinking of her but I was willing to bet that bringing her up would hurt Trish more than it would me. The thought made me grimace, it would work but that was a new low. Just how badly did I want to win? Steadying myself I took a deep breath despite the pain in my gut, raising my fists I caught her eye and gave her the smarmiest grin I could.\n\n\"Heh, you're pretty good.\"\n\n\"Pretty... Good?\" Trish seemed halfway between confusion and outrage\n\nThat was my chance, this time I was the one springing forward like a viper. Trish reacted with impressive speed but still too slow, I brought my fist up and cracked her right on the chin. Now THAT was a punch, I wouldn't be surprised if I lifted her off her feet with that. Hopping back from the recovering triceratops I let an easy smile come over me, fists still raised and dancing on my feet. Trish recovered far quicker than I expected, when she caught my gaze again I realized that her eyes were still focused. How the hell was that possible? She's even smiling god damnit! I didn't get much time to question it because Trish barreled after me, her strikes were too fast to block all of them as she peppered my abdomen and sides with jabs. God damn those sting, alright enough with this boxing shit it clearly wasn't working. Gritting my teeth I hunched down and launched myself forward, arms wide as I tackled her to the ground. Trish let out a surprisingly girlish yelp as I took her to the mat, her scales were warm and slick with the exertion of kicking my ass. Ha! Now I've got the tiny terror where I want her, raising my arm up I... Oh that's a fist coming for me. My vision is quickly obscured with red before it's lost entirely, I could use a nap anyways.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nAfter a positively riveting conversation with my ancient reptile brain, nice guy by the way, I found myself thrust back into my body of meat and pain. Groaning I blinked my eyes a few times and forced my head to swivel so I could see just what dimension I had landed in. I was seated on a bench outside the gym, the fluorescent lights too bright to look at compared to soothing night sky. Looks like volcadera bluff, figures I couldn't just isekai into my favorite visual novel, muzzle game. I took a moment to lean my head back and bask in the chilly air caressing my bruised and sore flesh, conciousness was overrated.\n\n\"Hey you, you're finally awake.\" A feminine voice jolted me out of my fugue.\n\nI suddenly became aware of a purple triceratops waiting expectantly for a reply. Wait, Trish was sitting right next to me? Since when? I really must have been out a long time because her hair was no longer damp with sweat instead curled into her usual style. Not to mention her impressive musculature and no less impressive bust were hidden beneath a warm looking jacket. She raised an eyebrow quizzically as I looked her over but chose not to comment.\n\n\"Why are you sitting with me?\" I sighed quietly, in too much pain to put effort into my voice. It was a genuine question. Didn't Trish hate my guts?\n\n\"Because I wanted to make sure I didn't kill you, idiot.\" She replied snarkily\n\nFair enough then, I sort of wish she had honestly. Would have a been a fitting end I thought as I dug around for my beloved smokes. A faded memory of fang mentioning cigarettes helping with pain weighed heavily on my mind. It definitely felt like I fell down those stairs a second time. At last finding my addiction I popped the menthol between my lips and inhaled the sweet succor that numbed the aches and pains of existence if only a little. Glancing over to trish I could see she was still looking at me or more specifically my cigarette, fuck it lets be polite for once. Taking one last beautiful drag I plucked it from my lips and held it over to Trish, trying my best to look friendly to the woman who knocked my ass out. Trish's face scrunched up at the smell of nicotine, the look she gave me definitely implied she thought I was a fucking idiot.\n\n\"I don't spend hours working on my body just to ruin it, no thank you\" her tone was snippier than the night air, clearly a sore subject.\n\nShrugging my shoulders I brought the precious cancer back to my lips for another drag, Tapping the ash on the pavement. I groaned inwardly, I was too hurt to get up and leave and I didn't want to sit around with an awkward silence. I guess I could catch up with her, we used to sort of be friends after all, right?\n\n\"So... Gym, huh? Wouldn't have expected you to be the type\" I said exhaling smoke as I did so.\n\nTrish adopted her old smirk but for whatever reason it lacked the mean spirit I usually associated with it.\n\n\"Let me put it in terms you understand\" she jutted her lower jaw forward, furrowed her eyebrows and uttered in her best baritone \"Me lift heavy stone, make sad head voice quiet\" her smile returned with a giggle at her casual racism.\n\nNow it was my turn to raise an eyebrow. \"Alright, I suppose I deserved that after my comment in the gym\"\n\n\"You definitely did\"\n\n\"Guess all your experience beating people up in high school paid off, you're even better at it now\" I countered, unwilling to let her have the last word.\n\nShe snorted at that \"Oh please, there was only a few times\" She started ticking fingers as she mentally went through them, when she got to ten she mysteriously decided to stop counting and became rather interested in anything but me.\n\nWe returned to silence after that but this time it felt a little more companionable. Never thought I'd meet Trish again, let alone that it would go better than my encounter with Fang. Flicking the butt of my cigarette and grinding it beneath my shoe I immediately lit up another one, fuck I hurt. Sliding a new menthol between my lips I looked over to see that Trish seemed pensive, something within my cold dead heart wanted me to ask her what was wrong. Maybe I was just lonely and didn't want the conversation to end or maybe I wasn't as upset at Trish as I thought. Aw hell, it's not like I was going to see her again after tonight right? Don't think I could show my face around here after getting cold clocked by Trish anyways.\n\n\"Spit it out, I'm listenin'\" I mumbled with the cigarette between my lips as I dug around for the lighter I literally just had.\n\n\"I just wanted to say, well, I'm sorry.\" her voice was soft and tinged with enough raw emotion that told me she was telling the truth\n\nI could feel my eyebrows rocket up my skull and it was only luck that kept that blessed cigarette in my mouth as it hung limply from my slack jaw.\n\n\"You.. You want to apologize to me?\" I was legitimately baffled, Never in my wildest dreams had I expected this\n\nShe let out a heavy sigh before she spoke \"Where to start? I shouldn't have been so hostile to you back at school, I had gotten so comfortable with the band that having some new guy there changing everything made me freak out.\"\n\n\"But it's not like I was any better friend to you, we were kids.\" I reminded her. Wait, why was I defending Trish?\n\n\"Just today I tricked you into a fight you couldn't win so I could vent five year old frustrations on you\" she argued.\n\nI waved her off \"Yeah but I was still the one who asked for it, besides you act like I wasn't eager to punch you in the face too.\"\n\nThe corners of her lips twitched as she threatened to smile but she looked away and continued \"It was monstrous of me to dig up your past to try and humiliate you in front of Fang and the school. When Fang broke up with you I was ecstatic to have my friend back but she wasn't the same. I couldn't console her or change her mind until eventually she just... drifted further and further away.\"\n\nShe turned back to look me in the eyes, her own were glistening with tears that threatened to spill. \"This whole time I couldn't help but think that I was the one putting strain on your relationship, that you never apologized to her because of me, that I was the reason Fang left everyone behind.\"\n\nThat gave me a bit to think about, it was true that Trish strained my relationship with Fang. I did end up more hostile after the doxxing incident, it was hard not too with everyone laughing at me. I could hear Fang's voice clear as day reminding me that \"Trish was right about you.\" It was true that that the thought of Trish's smug face made me tentative to approach the gang again. It made me feel like there was no way I could make up with Fang while Trish was whispering in her ear. Could it really be that simple? Trish was the one to blame for my fucked up life? Looking at the woman next to me, her breathing interspersed with silent sobs as she let herself relive every mistake she made... It made it hard to believe. My skull throbbed painfully, trying to think of some bullshit to excuse myself was proving too difficult when my brain felt like it was swelling. It would be easy to blame her for everything but I don't think even I could convince myself of it afterward.\n\n\"You cant apologize for that either, Trish.\" I spoke, my throat constricting as even through the fog of my mind I realized what I was admitting to the both of us.\n\n\"You aren't responsible for me, What I said to Fang were the words of a drunk idiot who was too much of an asshole to get over himself and try to earnestly understand the girl he loved. What I did afterward were the actions of a coward who would rather blame the world than himself and I'm not any better these days either.\" my voice rattled a bit as long forgotten emotion suddenly welled from within me\n\nTrish looked at me and I think this was the first time she truly looked at me, from my ratty clothes to my sunken eyes to the defeated posture I surely wore. I expected her to be relieved that I took the guilt off her or perhaps disgusted at who I had become but instead she smiled at me. It was a small smile, earnest and heartfelt that promised me she understood and it was because she understood that her smile was tinged with a sadness that her misty eyes only amplified.\n\n\"If that were the case Anon, I don't think you'd have admitted it.\" she replied sounding just as shaky as I did.\n\nThat hit me with a whiplash I wasn't expecting, both her realization and the fact that she used my name for the first time in memory. My mouth worked but I just couldn't find the words for her, not that it mattered because she kept speaking.\n\n\"It was nice of you to try and take some of the guilt off me\" her smile got a little sadder as she continued. \"But there's one thing I'll always blame myself for, I wanted to break you and Fang up because I was jealous she got you before I did.\"\n\nFucking hell Trish, keep dropping those bomb shells why don't you.\n\n\"Y-You were?\" I stammered out, barely recovered from the first revelation.\n\nShe chuckled, still a little choked with emotion for a true laugh \"Well yeah, why do you think I was always so mean to you? That's how girls show these things\"\n\n\"In grade school!\" I raised my voice a little louder than I meant to, but seriously!?\n\nShe looked indignant, puffing her cheeks \"it's not like I got to interact with many boys! There was literally just Reed and he was pitching for the other team!\"\n\nThat was... Actually not that surprising, honestly with eyelashes like those...\n\n\"We were stupid kids, huh?\" I realized as I flicked the stub of my cigarette to the sidewalk\n\n\"I don't know, I think you're still pretty stupid\" she crossed her arms, a bit of her old snark returning but I could tell she didn't mean it. When I didn't bother to defend myself she decided to follow it up.\n\n\"If you weren't then you'd have realized that I'm actually pretty great, not merely 'good'\" she said it with such disgust it sounded like she was genuinely offended at the the idea\n\n\"Yeah, you are\" I said with an easy smile, surprising myself at how quickly and naturally that slipped out of me.\n\nOh wow, I've never seen Trish blush before. The moment didn't last long unfortunately and we shared a somewhat nervous laugh at her expense, that long forgotten emotion in my breast was more present than ever. Putting this ghost to rest felt good and sharing the night with a friend who felt both old and new was good for the soul. We chatted more under the moonlight, about the past and about our careers. Turns out Trish really did go to the gym every day as she worked as a personal coach and dietician, she punched me in the arm when I told her she was always good at telling others what to do. I'm proud to say that I didn't cry even though I really wanted to. She seemed quite attentive to my old navy stories and was shocked at the tattoo's that I still had and the scars of those removed. Eventually however Trish checked her phone and frowned, seems all good things must come to an end. She stood from the bench and stretched out some aches giving me the chance to check her perfectly sculpted rear before she offered me her hand.\n\n\"You said you ran here? Can't exactly have you run home in your condition. Let me drive you, least I can do.\" She didn't actually wait for me to take her hand as she grabbed my arm and yanked me to my feet. Ow. Rosa eat your heart out.\n\nI wasn't about to refuse, If I even made it to skin row I'd likely be shanked before I got home. Giving Trish my address had her frown at me, concern clear in her eyes. I'm not sure why because she was easily the toughest damned dinosaur I've ever met by now. My thoughts drifted briefly to an absolute leviathan of a man, scar cut across the side of his face and the rumble of his voice as he made it clear he wasn't above decapitating me with a blunt object. Okay, maybe second toughest dinosaur. Trish led the way to her truck, far bigger than it needed to be but you know what they say about stereotypes. Buckling in and enjoying the plush seat I shot a small smile at Trish who returned it. Starting the truck the lights of the city were soon flashing by and suddenly the rigors of the day to hit me like, well, like Trish. Resting my head against the door and closing my eyes the last thing on my mind was just how different Trish seemed. It was a pleasant thought that lulled me to sleep just as surely as the rumble of the engine."},"Perfect Situation Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Perfect Situation Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"Chapter 3: Go Away\n\nI woke up feeling like a part of me had died, forcing open my crusty eyelids I scanned my shitty apartment. Trash bags lined the walls loaded to the brim, even my battlestation was looking lonely without the cups and plates. Well that was bizarre, I cant even remember the last time I cleaned but I wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth. Shifting in my bed my traitorous body helpfully decided to flare up with pain in half a dozen places. Hissing, I desperately tried to remember what the hell I did last night.\n\nThe aches at least helped cut through my early morning grogginess but the days all seemed to blur together when you did nothing but shitpost and sleep. Flashes of the other day started leaking into my conciousness; Blurs of pedestrians, clanking of metal, a purple and red bur. I screwed up my face as I tried to concentrate, fuck, did Trish give me a head injury? The name slipped unbidden to the forefront of my mind and I could suddenly see that smile we shared perfectly. The rest of the night came rushing back to me with clarity, I couldn't believe I bumped into Trish let alone that we're friends again. At least I think we are, it's been a long time since I had one of those.\n\nSliding out of the delightfully warm bed despite it's provocations I listlessly meandered over to the bathroom for a shower. I'd normally sleep well into the afternoon but I missed dinner last night and it's not like anyone was going to feed me. My stomach grumbled as I turned the knob and waited for the water to heat up. Turns out jogging a few miles and getting your ass kicked works up a hell of an appetite, who knew? Disrobing and stepping into the the lukewarm water I had to bite my lip as the pressurized streams pounded against my battered body. I got a good look at it as I lathered myself, my abdomen was definitely not supposed to be that color and there were ugly splotches on my chest as well. Note to self, never fight Trish again. Keeping my shower brief I caught my reflection as I gingerly toweled myself off. My lip was busted and I could plainly see now that Trish slammed me in the temple to knock me out.\n\nReaching my hand up to tentatively touch the swollen lump of flesh that nearly wrapped its way around to my eye. I winced as my fingers brushed against it, the sudden lance of pain making me woozy. What the hell did I expect? Frowning at my beautiful face being marred I wrapped the towel around my waist and leaned down to liberate some smokes from my discarded pants. The click of the lighter did almost as much as the nicotine for soothing me. I tried not to think about how many of these I had gone through the past few days but I was an injured man! I sure as hell wasn't going to afford any actual pain medication.\n\nStepping back into what I could charitably call my living room the damp hairs on my neck suddenly stood straight up. There were sounds of movement coming from the kitchen, Shit! Fuck! Why did a crackhead have to break into my apartment when I was naked and bruised? I crouched low and walked softly as my eyes swept the room for any sort of weapon, where the hell did I put my pocket knife? A few seconds later I realized I left it in the kitchen because I couldn't afford proper knives. Alright, no problem Anon there's a drugged up psychopath in the kitchen with your knife, you've never fought with your dick out but you got this. Fortunately whoever was in there seemed to be preoccupied with looking for something. Jokes on you asshole, I was too poor for your pantry raid. Creeping along the walls I managed to sneak up on my intruder, peeking around the corner I saw...\n\n\"Trish!?\"\n\nThe woman in question looked over, apparently unaware of how much she had scared me. She was dressed sparsely, a small shirt that left her stomach exposed and gray shorts were all that covered her. She was leaning over my stove clearly cooking something though I had no idea what because there was no food in the house. She must have jogged here if the damp patch in her bulging tank top was any indication. Unsurprisingly her abdominal muscles were well defined and good lord those shorts really earned their name, was this trigger utterly oblivious to how she looked or was I just that lonely?\n\n\"Yeah, that's me.\" She replied nonchalantly before looking me up and down and letting out a low whistle \"Damn, I do good work\"\n\nIt took me a moment to realize she was talking about the ugly welts lining my body and I could feel my frustration building\n\n\"How did you even get in here!?\" I shouted, pointing an accusatory finger at her\n\nShe merely shrugged \"I came to check up on you, I knocked but you never answered. Door was open though!\"\n\nI looked back to my front door, I made damn sure to lock that thing every night. The latch where the lock would slot into had somehow managed to come loose, fallen to the floor. I Looked back at Trish with a suspicious glare which she met with a smirk.\n\n\"Like I said, I knocked.\" she curled an honestly impressive bicep for emphasis that had the added effect of pushing up her no less impressive bust.\n\nAh, So this is what people mean when they say 'scaroused'. Realizing I was still wearing nothing but a towel I bit the inside of my cheek to avoid anything embarrassing. Having mastered myself I felt confident to continue questioning my home invader.\n\n\"Alright, How about WHY are you here?\"\n\nShe looked at me quizzically for a moment, clearly I said something stupid but at this point I'm used to it.\n\n\"You don't remember? When I drove you home you were tired and mumbling pretty bad but you definitely asked me for help. I thought you meant the stairs at first but seeing this.\" She sweeps her arm out to gesture at my apartment \"I can see why now, you've lost control of yourself. How do you even live like this?\" Her tone was harsh but she looked genuinely concerned.\n\nMy cheeks began to flush as I realized just what my mess of a home must look like to someone else, let alone someone as well put together as Trish.\n\n\"Yeah, well you weren't supposed to see it! Everyone lives messy, I just didn't get any time to clean because you BROKE into my HOUSE!\" I felt my righteous indignation returning\n\nTrish pointedly ignored my accusation and crossed her arms \"No, not everyone lives like this. Nobody lets trash pile up like that unless they're unwell. You're WELCOME for the maid service by the way, I didn't have to clean up your pig sty\"\n\nRolling my eyes I replied \"Oh sure, thanks mom.\"\n\n\"Clearly you need one\" she huffed but her expression quickly turned devious. Oh no, that damned smirk of hers is back.\n\n\"If that's how it is then first rule, no smoking in the house.\"\n\nNo... Smoking? Quick as a whip she snatches the long forgotten cigarette from my lips and grinds it in a nearby ashtray. Motherfucker! Oh she's going to get it now, I open my mouth to yell at her again but she cuts me off just as I start\n\n\"Shut up and eat this.\" She says sharply, handing me a paper plate with a frankly delicious looking chicken breast topped with some manner of red and orange plant matter on and around it. I was still ready to argue but my stomach wasn't and interrupted me well before I could gather my thoughts. I settled for giving her a nasty look before digging in, Trish merely rolled her eyes at my petulance. A few bites in I had to stop just to savor this delicacy, Food can taste this good? Some might have called it too spicy but I was in heaven as every bite saturated my palate with juicy goodness. Alright, Trish was forgiven if she can cook like this. The chicken disappeared far too quickly and I was sorely tempted to lick the plate but I thought better of it, at least while Trish was watching. In fact, Trish was looking at me quite expectantly now that I was finished.\n\n\"Alright fine, best damn chicken I've ever eaten\"\n\nHer expression didn't change.\n\n\"Um, thank you?\"\n\nShe finally smiled at that \"Good, glad you like it because we're going to go get more today.\"\n\n\"We are?\" I asked, confused\n\n\"We are.\" she echoed more confidently\n\nI gave a heavy sigh at that \"When did I sign up to have you micromanage my life?\"\n\n\"Last night, we just went over this. Now go get dressed already, you aren't impressing anyone with that gut of yours.\" She replied, waving dismissively\n\nI'm ashamed to admit that I nearly followed her order without question but a flame of defiance still burned within me.\n\n\"Hey wait a minute, don't you have a job you're supposed to be doing?\" I realized\n\nGreat, another one of those 'You're a fucking idiot' looks\n\n\"What do you think I'm doing right now? I usually make people pay for this you know.\" She shifted into a more easy going smile \"You're lucky you get the friend discount.\"\n\nI didn't feel very lucky as my injuries complain about me sliding the closest thing I had to clean clothes over them. They complained even louder as I descended the stairs to meet Trish at her totally not compensating truck. Guess she drove here right after a work out, probably a hell of a lot smarter than running everywhere like my poor ass. Trish didn't seem too concerned as she watched me wince my way over to her, in fact she had yet another demand for me.\n\n\"Oh, and you'll be calling me 'Coach' from here on out.\" Her expression made it impossible to tell whether she was serious or not.\n\n\"I'm not doing that.\" I stated in no uncertain terms\n\nShe pretended not to hear me as she hopped in her truck. Moving to the opposite side I realized the door was locked.\n\n\"Hey Trish, you mind unlocking this?\" I called out\n\nI could see her smug expression from the driver seat, she was waiting for something. Waitng for... Oh god damnit, fine, be that way you little monster. We stared at each other through the glass, a silent contest of wills taking place. I could either walk to the store riddled with bruises and more sore than I've been in 5 years or I could call Trish coach. Ten minutes later I was seriously beginning to regret my choice as my body begged me to stop. Trish had been slowly following me in her truck waiting for me to give up, it was a good reminder to keep going. My world became a haze of pain as I put one foot in front of the other, I don't even know if I was heading in the right direction anymore. Surprisingly however, Trish pulled up next to me and popped open the door.\n\n\"Fine, you made your point. Get in, If you limp the whole way there this will take all day\" she grumbled.\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief, buckling into the seat and letting my aching body rest.\n\n\"You're lucky we aren't back in school, I would have left your stubborn ass.\" she said as she adjusted her mirror and picked up speed\n\nBack in school, huh? I guess we really weren't anymore. I looked over at Trish while she concentrated on the road, It was shocking how she managed to look so different and yet exactly the same. Five whole years had gone by and Trish seems to have sculpted more than just her body, She would have never done so much for me back in the day. She basically took the day off and rather than spend it at home she's here helping me out, she cleaned my house for gods sake! The more I thought about it the more I realized that I was still treating Trish like we were in school. The whole coach thing wasn't some weird power play, she was probably just trying to have some fun with me. Judging by her furrowed brow she was upset, I can hardly blame her with how I've been acting this morning. Even I was starting to feel a little guilty about all this.\n\n\"Hey...\" I trailed off, unsure how to go about it.\n\nOh great, I've got her attention. Fortunately she still has to look at where she's going but now I have to say something.\n\n\"I just wanted to say thanks, y'know, for all the stuff that you're doing for me. It means a lot to me, uh, coach.\" I muttered feeling heat rise in my cheeks.\n\nI could see the surprise evident in her features even without her looking at me. When Trish glanced my way it was with a smile that warmed the heart. Unlike her usual smug grins it felt like she was being truly earnest with her smile, it only lasted a moment before she returned her attention to the wheel.\n\n\"Don't mention it, skinnie\" She said softly.\n\nWe shared a few quiet moments but I could see that her expression had relaxed now, I knew I did the right thing.\n\n\"Okay, that was a lie. You should totally mention it a bunch\" she joked. At least, I think she joked.\n\nShould have expected that honestly, we shared a laugh and some tension I never realized was there diffused. The drive to the more affordable super market at least gave me some time to chat Trish up about something that had been bugging me. Apparently, Triceratops had really thick skulls so that they could make use of their horns. That meant going for a head shot against Trish was pointless, good to know that I didn't suddenly forget how to throw a punch. Just yet another biological advantage I thought darkly, damned meteor dodgers have it easy. Unsurprisingly Trish knew about the overly peppy gym receptionist, Sarah. She was actually quite animated talking about her, they clearly shared some interest beyond the gym but when I asked her about it she clammed up quickly. Squinting my eyes I could have sworn she had a faint blush but it was hard to tell with her facial markings. Our destination loomed in view quickly enough with good company to speed up the passage of time. I cant say I was looking forward to saying goodbye to spending yet more money but I did need the food.\n\nAs we walked down the aisles Trish started rattling off nutrition information and I tried my best to keep up. The conversation was a blur of calories, vitamins, fats, supplements all the while she was holding packages out to me like I had any idea what the hell she was saying. Not to mention this was information specifically about adult human males, why is she so well versed in those? Fortunately, I was an expert in pretending I had any idea what I was doing and defaulted into the age old smile and nod. I was taken by surprise when she hooked her arm with mine, I think she did it just to steer me around better but it felt... Intimate. It was nice, her body was firm but strong and pliable and I even had the pleasure of her breasts brushing against me occasionally.\n\nGod I really was lonely, but in my brief reprieves from Trish's info dumps I could see jealous stares of every meteor dodger in here. Who could blame them? Her exercise clothes left just the right amount to the imagination. That put a bit of swagger into my otherwise limping step, now that I knew I had an audience I couldn't help but ham it up. This time I was the one steering Trish around and pestering her about junk food, She was definitely amused by my sudden confidence but quickly started to tug me along again.\n\nOh now it's on, once I started fighting her in this bizarre tug-o-war she looked up at me with a dangerous smile. This was a challenge and I quickly found myself arm wrestling her for control in the eternal struggle between healthy and tasty. Despite my best efforts Trish won the war but at least I had a few battles under my belt. I secretly suspected that Trish let me win those but I'd like to keep my masculinity intact so I don't dwell on it. We had been having so much fun with our game that I hadn't even realized just how full the cart had gotten. I didn't even need to check my wallet to know that I couldn't afford all of this. Sighing, I steeled myself for the embarrassment and informed Trish that we'd need to put most of this back. Trish looked at me, surprise clear on her features while her eyes searched mine. Oh great here comes the pity, I can practically feel it coming.\n\n\"I guess I did spring this on you, let me get my purse from the truck. I'll cover it this time but you owe me!\"\n\nShe disentangled her arm from mine and waved me off when I started sputtering. Now alone with my groceries I mentally tallied them up again, This must have been two hundred dollars worth and she was just going to pay it? What the hell did I do to deserve this? We've been reunited for a day and all I've done is insult her and complain. Shaking my head as the reality settled in I figured that if Trish was going to cover my groceries I could probably afford a second pack of smokes. I mean, it was partially her fault I went through so many of them anyways so it's fine right? Unused to this store I flagged down one of the employees, a pterosaur, she was stocking the shelves painfully slow. They couldn't have been too busy.\n\n\"Excuse me, miss?\"\n\nThe employee flinched as I spoke up, now that I was closer to her I could see distinctive tattoo's partially obscured by her uniform. Surely it couldn't be...?\n\n'Can I help you?\" That feminine rasp was like ice water as Fang stood up and turned to look at me, she didn't look very pleased I was here.\n\n\"But.. You.. The band?\" My brain struggled to process seeing Fang again, but in a new low this time. There was something intrinsically wrong about seeing her wearing something as soulless as a uniform.\n\n\"Doesn't pay the bills\" she replied, her voice was utterly hollow.\n\nI wanted to tell her that it was unfair, that she was talented, that she was above this. Staring into her eyes, faded as they were, told me that she didn't want pity any more than I did. This was the second time our paths crossed by pure fate, could I really dare to hope again? Was there still anything left between us to salvage? Why even bother, it's not like I could change anything. My voice died on my lips as I wondered what magic words I could tell Fang to make it all okay again. Realization suddenly dawned on me, of course!\n\n\"Me and Trish came here together, you can meet her again!\" I exclaimed excitedly, it's been a long time but they were still friends for ten years that's got to count for something, right?\n\nFang narrowed her eyes at me. \"I saw\" her icy tone implied that if she wasn't at her job I'd be hearing slightly different words.\n\n\"Great! She'll be coming back any moment now then we can-\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk to her. Or you.\" Fang interrupted, A bit of heat rising in her voice.\n\nI deflated at that, I thought I had toughened up over the years but Fang always managed to cut right through me. Was there really no salvaging this? Us?\n\n\"She misses you, Fang. She blames herself for what you're going through.\" I felt guilty revealing something Trish told me in confidence, but this was Fang!\n\nFang paused, searching my eyes for any hint of treachery. God, it hurt me to look into hers and see nothing but sadness and anger.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" She sighed, sounding absolutely defeated\n\nMy heart sunk, for the briefest of moments I saw the start of a different path, one where we could all be friends again. The logical part of me knew that I should give up but that cold heart of mine was starting to beat again and it wouldn't let me walk away without one more try.\n\n\"Look, when do you get off? I still owe you some smokes don't I?\" I offered tentatively\n\nFang looked at me in disbelief but when I didn't have anything more than a hopeful smile she sighed.\n\n\"And a cheese burger\" she said at last\n\n\"And a cheese burger\" I agreed, my eyes trailing down her uniform. It was a small and she still managed to make it look baggy.\n\nI could hear the doors to the super market slide open and looked to see Trish stride in with purse in hand.\n\n\"It's at nine' she whispered hastily\n\nTurning back to Fang I realized she was already gone, walking to the back room with haste. I wanted to follow her but I knew Trish was waiting for me. Meeting up with her she proved as good as her word, which absolutely floored me. Turns out I really did owe her however, she was planning to use me as an assistant since I had so much free time. That included as a teaching aide for anyone that wanted to learn boxing, the very thought made my bruises ache. Trish tried to engage me in conversation on the ride home but I was far too distracted thinking of meeting up with Fang again. She could clearly tell my mind was elsewhere but didn't press the issue, the thought made me feel guilty but I couldn't help it.\n\nTrish followed me back up to give me instructions on how to prepare the dishes she picked out, even wrote the portions and stuck it to my fridge. She also made sure to dump an entire can of air freshener in my apartment to try and combat the smell of cigarette smoke. Trish even stuck around long enough to help me carry the trash bags to the garbage but had to leave soon enough. Even on a day off she was apparently too busy to hang around all day and drove off after giving me a once over with my new schedule as her assistant. Standing in an apartment with too much empty space that smelled more like a scented candle than my home I suddenly felt very alone.\n\nFlipping open my laptop I saw I still had plenty of hours until Fang was done with her shift. I guess I could shitpost a little to kill time. Turns out it killed exactly ten minutes because I was filled with an energy that couldn't be quelled, It just felt like wasted time. Honestly I even considered cleaning but one glance around my empty apartment told me there wasn't much for me to do. Even videogames, my last bastion, could only hold my attention for an hour. Needing something to divert my energy into I started meal prepping like Trish recommended, At last this was something that eased the electric impulse in my brain. I was accomplishing something, now that I know what I needed to do I even found myself doing bodyweight routines despite that same body complaining. After an impromptu walk around the neighborhood that was likely more dangerous than it was worth I had finally burned enough time to go see Fang. I was quite surprised to see a cab at the exact time I needed one, I don't think I had seen one at all until just now. Sliding into the back seat I recognize a familiar face.\n\n\"Been a while hasn't it, kid?\" he chuckled and started driving before I could even mention where I was going.\n\nNo fucking way was this guy still the only cab driver in the entire city, was this some sort of cosmic prank? The red raptor raised one of his ostentatiously bushy eyebrows as he looked at my expression in the mirror.\n\n\"Alright, spit it out before you explode. I don't want to clean up the mess back there.\" He laughed at his own joke.\n\n\"Are you actually the only cab driver in the city?\" I asked, fearing I already knew the answer.\n\n\"As far as you're concerned? Yep.\" He apparently found that hilarious too. What the hell was that supposed to mean?\n\n\"You must see a lot of people then, any good stories?\" Honestly I wasn't that interested but my stomach was doing flips at the idea of meeting Fang again and I could use a distraction.\n\nHe lets out a low whistle \"Good stories? You bet I have kiddo. Seen a lot of guys like you do a lot of things.\"\n\n\"Like?\" I sighed impatiently.\n\nHe scratched at his equally ostentatious beard before continuing \"Well, this one time I took these two kids, Both wearing suits mind you, to prom. Tried to set the mood for 'em but they weren't having it. Next thing I know, the girl shoots up her school and her boyfriend, terrible stuff.\" he tried to sound flippant but it was clear he really was upset about it. Guess it's more personal when you've met the murderer.\n\n\"Wow, that's... Yeah.\" I couldn't find the words, guess I got what I asked for.\n\n\"Oh it ain't all bad, this other time I drove these two lovebirds to some special gathering at the end of the year. They were obviously head over heels and you could see the respect they had for each other immediately. Didn't have it in my heart to charge 'em for the trip, wouldn't be surprised if they were still together.\"\n\nMy thoughts immediately drifted to Fang, that could have been us. The fantasy was pleasant enough to keep me distracted but I knew in my heart that it wasn't realistic. I directed the cab driver to a fast food place for Fang's burger and it wasn't long before we found ourselves at the supermarket. Wait, did I ever tell him where I was going?\n\n\"So how much do I owe you?\" I asked, hopping out of the car and digging around for my wallet.\n\nSurprisingly the cab driver shook his head \"Like I said, don't have it in my heart to charge lovebirds. You're lucky to have this chance, kid. You ain't supposed to\"\n\nNani the fuck? I open my mouth to ask him what in the hell he's talking about but he's already driving off. So I stood there, in the middle of the night, with a burger and a shitload of questions. Well that's bizarre but not my problem at the moment, turning to the supermarket I realize that she never actually said where she'd meet me. Well, I could stand on the sidewalk like an idiot or I could go looking and possibly miss her. Sighing I chose option 2, waiting for Fang never worked in the past and I only got this far by being proactive. First stop, the parking lot in the back.\n\nFirst stop turned out to be last stop as my quarry was leaning against the building, the vibrant ember of her own cigarette lighting up the night. For the first time she seemed pretty nonchalant about meeting me and waved me over, guess that's what happens when you actually plan these things instead of just bumping into each other.\n\n\"You got the stuff?\" She asked, her tone was flat.\n\nAdmittedly I had no idea whether she meant the cigarettes or the burger so I just nodded.\n\nFang flicked her stub of a cigarette to the ground, I noticed she didn't even bother to put it out as she reached for the bag in my hand and unwrapped the contents within. It was uncomfortable watching her tear into it like she hadn't eaten in days, I remember her doing the same with the pizza.\n\n\"Fang, are you getting enough to eat?\" The question slipped out without me even realizing it.\n\nShe paused her ravenous devouring of the patty to look at me and then continued in much more measured bites. \"Mhm\" she confirmed, mouth full of food.\n\nI didn't buy that for a second, but should I push her on this? Once again my mind told me no, that it was just too risky. But my rapidly beating heart urged me to push forwards, I'd never get anywhere with Fang walking on eggshells.\n\n\"Fang, you work a full time job and play concerts on the side, why are you so thin?\" I asked, keeping my voice as measured as possible.\n\nFang lashed out immediately \"None of your fuckin' business, asshole. Pay up those smokes already.\"\n\nSo nothing good then I thought as reached for my back pocket, popping open the pack I realized I was down to my last three cigarettes. With a sigh I slid one out for Fang and myself. We managed to take a simultaneous first drag, it was always the best one. With the calming nicotine in my veins I looked up at the sky, not a cloud in sight and a full moon beaming down on us amidst a tapestry of stars. It really was a beautiful night I thought as I brought the menthol to my lips again. I could feel Fangs gaze on me as I looked up but when I turned to her she diverted it quickly. Shrugging I returned to my star watching, getting nervous and forcing conversation didn't work last time. In a certain way I was content just to spend time with Fang even if my heart begged for more, sorry buddy but I think brains got the right of it this time.\n\n\"So, did you get mugged or something?\" Fang actually broke the silence, pointing at my lip. If I didn't know any better I'd say she was actively trying to sound uninterested.\n\nI chuckled at that, still staring up at the sky \"You'd think so but nah, Trish just kicked my ass\"\n\nI could suddenly hear Fang choking and I whipped around to help her but she just hacked up her cigarette butt and started laughing, even at my expense it was good to hear her laugh earnestly.\n\n\"Oh man she did? She kept saying she would but it always sounded like hot air to me\" She looked at me with with a smirk, close enough to a smile right?\n\n\"Heh, like you wouldn't believe. Get a load of this\" I raised the hem of my shirt to expose one of the discolored blotches on my abdomen to the cool night air.\n\nFang whistled at that \"Alright, I stand corrected. NOW you look like shit\"\n\nI did my best to look upset while Fang cackled at me \"Yeah sure, yuck it up. You've seen her, she's swole as hell\"\n\n\"So you two got a beaten housewife sort of deal going on?\" There was mirth in her eyes but her words just left me confused\n\n\"Beaten housewife? What?\" I asked, staring at her incredulously\n\n\"Yeah, you two.. Y'know?\" She decided to clarify by sticking her index finger through a hole she made with her fingers. Repeatedly.\n\nNow it was my turn to cough, The surprise of it making me inhale far too much smoke. \"What? No! We only just made up with each other.\"\n\nFang stared at me for a moment, I'm not sure if she believed me but eventually she shrugged \"You know I only agreed to this because I thought you weren't trying to fuck me, right?\"\n\nA thousand words stumbled over themselves to try and reassure her that wasn't what I was after. \"N-no! O-Of course not!\" was the lame response that forced itself from my lips.\n\nShe quirked an eyebrow at that \"So what, am I not fuckable anymore without my long hair?\" Her voice was dangerous, venomous.\n\n\"No! I- You-\" I sputtered, failing to come up with something that sounded reasonable\n\n\"Alright, don't explode dweeb. Just pass me another cigarette\" She cut me off, cool as ever.\n\nI gave up trying to salvage that disaster and fumbled around for the pack, pulling out the very last cigarette with reverence. \"fine, but it's my last one so we're sharing\" I reminded her.\n\nShe looked like she wanted to argue but any good smoker knows the code. I let her have the first drag however, let it never be said that I'm not generous. She passed it back to me afterwards and I stared at the slightly damp filter, memories of a time long past where I got nervous sharing second-hand kisses with the same girl across from me now. I brought it to my lips and savored the feeling again, Maybe it was pathetic but it's not like anyone else knew. We made that cigarette last, both of us enjoying the night sky and the quiet company. Fang tapped some ash to ground, not much left of it now and then we wouldn't have an excuse to be together anymore.\n\n\"So, you and Trish really aren't a thing?\" She asked, her expression unreadable while she was stargazing\n\n\"Mhm\" words just didn't feel right at the moment\n\nFang brings the cigarette to her lips and takes a deep breath, finishing off what was left and grinding it beneath her boot.\n\n\"Could've fooled me.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say to that."},"Perfect Situation Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Perfect Situation Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"Chapter 4: The Good Life\n\nIt had been a month since Trish stumbled into my life and helped me put it at least somewhat straight. Before all this I'd think that was no time at all but now that I was out and doing things every day it felt like an eternity. My first week as her assistant was awkward, especially because she really did demand I call her coach while we were with clients. Most of them were from the richer neighborhoods but we must have scoured the whole city in the Trish-mobile. Personally I preferred calling it the \"Trigga Truck\" but my boss seemed less than enthused at the name. One day I thought she was going to pull into into Fangs old house and scared me half to death but it was thankfully just their neighbors. Still, it wasn't too uncommon for us to pass by while Ripley was doing some manner of yard work.\n\nTrish didn't seem to understand why I was always so nervous in that neighborhood but she wasn't the one with a death sentence if he recognized her. Beyond the close calls with Fang's dad it was honestly pretty pleasant and Trish decided to clear my debt after that first week. However she enjoyed having a secretary\/punching bag hybrid so much that she offered to pay me to keep the position. I decided to take her offer and with the new payment I bought some slacks and a pretty swanky vest so it would look less like she dragged a hobo off the street. Trish was delighted and often went out of her way to adjust it so I looked perfect when we were meeting our clients. I'm not exactly sure why because she was still in casual wear but hey, she's the coach. It wasn't exactly good pay, basically minimum wage but I still had my pension and I really did enjoy spending time with Trish.\n\nThat didn't mean she forgot my personal training however, Trish had me perform a litmus test day one and has been pushing me to my limits. It wasn't even just the physical exhaustion because she enforced the no smoking rule at home too. Not that she could actually stop me but if she ever came over and smelled cigarette smoke I knew I'd be worked twice as hard the next day. It just wasn't worth the risk, the woman was an absolute slave driver. Some days I really wanted to hate her, hell some days I actually did. Except It was hard to argue with how much better I had been feeling after eating right and working out so much. Even so, my inability to smoke at home, in her truck, at the gym or when we were with clients had my addiction clawing at the edges of my mind more than ever.\n\nI probably would have snapped by now if not for my 'smoke dates' with Fang though she'd stop showing up if she knew I called them that. I wouldn't be so generous as to call us 'friends' again, maybe just a couple lonely souls that were looking to be a little less lonely for a while. We only sparingly talked during them, there were a couple bad days it felt like I was feeding a wild animal with cigarettes and fast food. Those nights had her picking at her skin with her head on a wide eyed swivel as if she expected something horrible to happen. Thankfully there were also moments when she acted like herself again.\n\nThe first time I showed up in my work clothes she lost her shit and made me stand still so she could scribble some glasses on my face, that way I could be 'the one true dweeb'. While it was embarrassing at the time, especially because she was still on the clock and plenty of customers saw. She had to hold my face to draw it correctly and her being comfortable enough for that was a small victory I was going to cherish. Other days though she seemed more reclusive than ever, plucking loose feathers, looking nervous and even acting jittery. It was bad enough to watch her suffer, it was worse knowing she wouldn't trust me to help her.\n\nToday though I was left completely to my own devices, Trish managed to get sick despite easily having 16 constitution and Fang wasn't answering. I frowned at my phone, yet another new thing I could afford now that I was vaguely employed. Fang not answering wasn't uncommon, she usually only replied to me at night so I tried not to worry about it. I worried about it every time. Flipping to my contacts I stared at the only two names in there, Fang and Trish really were the only people I knew. My parents were still alive I suppose but neither of us decided to call when I got out of the navy and I wasn't about to start now.\n\nSighing, I pocketed my phone and headed outside wondering just what the hell a guy like me was supposed to do on a sunday morning. I offered to take care of Trish, it was the least I could do after all. She seemed really hesitant about inviting me over though, it was utterly bizarre because it's not like she hid where she lived from me. Maybe she had some dark skeleton in the closet or maybe she was just embarrassed by a messy house. There wasn't any way to find out so there was only one thing to do. Time to spend the day wandering aimlessly and haunt the sidewalks of Skinrow and beyond. I spied a hot dog stand amidst the crowds of people and my stomach growled. Technically street food wasn't a part of my meal plan but I deserved a treat now and then didn't I? Besides, Coach Trish wasn't around at the moment. Smiling devilishly at my nefarious plan I walked over to the orange woman manning the stand.\n\n\"Hey there, chief! What can I get ya?\" she called out as I approached\n\nI scratched my chin as I thought about it. \"One with everything, please\" my stomach has been a black hole these days.\n\nShe grinned at that \"Alright then, one everything dog for the big guy!\"\n\nBig guy? I looked down at myself, I had dressed up in my work clothes out of habit and the shirt\/vest combo really didn't cover my build like my old sweater or jacket did. I got the vest explicitly because I wasn't self conscious about my arms anymore after all. The muscles the navy gave me had been refined by Trish's exercise routine and my old fast food gut was much slimmer after all the cardio. I looked... Nice? It wasn't a feeling I was accustomed to. The vendor lady worked quickly and soon enough I had my prize in hand. The first bite was incredible, oh sweet preservatives and artificial flavors how I have missed you. Without any objective for the day I simply stood by the hot dog stand and watched people walk past as I enjoyed my treat.\n\n\"Trying to work up the courage to ask me out, huh?\" The vendor lady spoke up, she waggled her eyebrows to compliment her smirk\n\nI nearly choked on my hotdog, since when do women hit on me? \"N-no! Not that you're- Just that-\" God I really was bad at this.\n\n\"Well hey, if you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.\" she fluttered her eyelashes at me\n\nAlright that was a little much, taking one more bite I stared at her suspiciously until I realized something.\n\n\"You're fucking with me.\" I stated with certainty\n\n\"Not yet, handsome\" her voice was practically husky as she leaned over her stand to show off her 'assets'\n\nOh god, DEFCON 2! Sound the alarms! What do I do? I don't even know her name! Failing any kind of training or experience in this situation I just stared at her cluelessly, blushing like an idiot.\n\nShe chuckled and started laughing progressively harder until she was wheezing, hand holding her stomach.\n\nEventually she managed to control herself and wiped a tear from her eye \"Don't worry kid, You're cute but a little young for me.\"\n\nI let out a breath I didn't realize I had been holding, Young? She looked barely over 30! Who was she calling kid anyways?\n\n\"Yeah, yeah very funny. You do this with every guy?\" I grumbled\n\n\"Nah, but you were looking a little lost. What's going on pal?\" it sounded like a genuine question, even if she was still chuckling.\n\nI gave up trying to salvage my pride, looking out at the crowds on the street \"Nothing really, that's the problem. I've got no plans and no idea what to do.\" I concluded with a shrug\n\nAs I stared at those crowds I realized the vendor lady hadn't said anything in a while, turning back to her revealed that she was looking at me like I was an idiot. Guess that look wasn't exclusive to Trish.\n\n\"Nothin' to do!? There's a whole world out there! Get out of here and go do something you ain't never done before! Go on!\" She shouted and pointed down the street with a spatula, why does she even have that?\n\nI opened my mouth to respond but she actually left her stand to physically push me down the sidewalk\n\n\"Hey! Wait- What are you- C'mon!\" I argued but she wasn't having any of it\n\n\"And don't come back til' you've done something!\" She called out once I got the hint and started walking on my own\n\nI waved goodbye to the weirdly pushy hotdog lady and headed down the road. That advice was all well and good but it still didn't really give me any direction. Back to aimless wandering then, I needed to work off that hot dog anyways. I opened up my phone and dropped a quick shitpost in an indonesian basket weaving forum but was cut short by a ban. What do you mean I can't make a thread about muzzle game on the video game board? A bell ringing interrupted my frustrations with the janitors, looking up I realized I had found myself at the last place I expected to. The church of our lord and saviour Raptor Jesus, I suppose it was sunday so that explains the bell. Streams of colorful individuals filed through the doors, many of them greeting an orange woman in a white garb with a shawl around her shoulders. She looked so familiar... Wait were those prayer beads at her hip?\n\n\"Rosa!?\" I called out, not quite believing it\n\nThe woman glanced over at her name, she looked surprised only briefly before her face lit up like a christmas tree\n\n\"An-on!\" She hurried over to meet me \"\u00bf\u00a1D\u00f3nde has estado!?\"\n\nI was about to reply to her but I suddenly found it hard to breathe while I was crushed in her grip. Maybe a younger anon would have perished but despite my surprise I was ready for the counter offensive. As soon as her grip loosened I tightened mine and put my new muscles to work, sweeping her off her feet like the debonair I pretended to be in the shower. When I heard a girly yelp I knew I had won our little contest.\n\n\"Ahh! Put me down An-on!\" she was shouting but clearly delighted. Still, if it's what the lady wants I'm willing to oblige.\n\nPlacing her back on her feet I could see that her face was flush, her hands immediately went to her voluminous hair to make sure everything was in place. Looking around I caught the other church-goers who saw our exchange throwing smiles our way. I could feel my cheeks heating up much lika Rosa's. The woman in question finally finished preening and looked up at me with an excitement that was infectious.\n\n\"It is good that you saw the light of Raptor Jesus, hallowed be his name, I knew you had it in you!\" She positively beamed at me\n\nI mean, I wasn't exactly athiest but I don't know if I'd say that I 'saw the light'. Clearly my confusion was visible because Rosa soon adopted a similar look.\n\n\"You are here for church, Si? You are in your sunday best! Muy guapo.\"\n\nHuh, I suppose when she puts it like that it would sound bizarre to tell her that this was all circumstance.\n\n\"Sorry Rosa, I didn't actually come to listen to the good word\" I admitted, rubbing the back of my head sheepishly\n\nI expected her to be upset but bizarrely she got even more excited\n\n\"Ah! You came for the choir then! \u00a1Excelente! We needed a baritone!\" She started tugging me towards those pearly gates, what did I get myself into?\n\n\"Uhm, no, Rosa! I can't sing!\" last thing I needed to do was ruin everyone's sunday with my warbling.\n\nShe blissfully stopped tugging me and looked back, her gaze was calculating until she came to a decision.\n\n\"\u00a1No hay problema! You follow their lead, they teach you. Sencillo.\"\n\nThe words of that hot dog lady bounced around in my skull, 'do something you've never done before'. Was I seriously considering this? Was I really taking the sage advice of someone that sold food on the street for a living?\n\n\"Lead the way, Rosa.\" I sighed, this was a mistake.\n\nShe clapped her hands together, utterly thrilled. \"Wonderful! We can catch up after church. Ven conmigo.\"\n\nRosa led me past the concession and introduced me to the various members of the choir who were doing vocal warm ups. Having directed me to the person in charge Rosa gave me two thumbs up and left to go find her seat. Chatting with the choir lead, an iguanodon by the name of Alan, he gave gave me a few beginner tips that were honestly pretty simple. Breathe with your gut, keep your tongue relaxed and hold your posture. After that brief conversation he had me join the rest of the group with the warm ups.\n\nIt was blatantly obvious that I had never sung before but surprisingly the rest of the choir didn't mention anything. I don't think I ever stopped blushing, I didn't even sing in the shower let alone in front of a crowd and I was about to do it in front of an even bigger one soon. Alan had to correct my posture and politely informed me that I was breathing wrong more than once, I'd been breathing all my life why was this so hard? When the time came I felt woefully unprepared, why did I agree to this?\n\nStanding amidst a crowd of confident people did little to impart their confidence onto me. I could see Rosa looking at me from her seat like a proud mother and I even caught Alan giving me a reassuring smile just before we started, here goes nothing. Once I started singing I realized it was... Good? My voice wasn't quite drowned but conjoined with so many others and transformed into something else entirely. I could still hear myself but the faces of everyone else told me that my poor singing skills didn't ruin the song. Now that I knew I wasn't about to be kicked out or shamed for my lack of skill I could feel myself relaxing into the song.\n\nI was a little behind everyone, I didn't know the lyrics and had to copy their lead but it still sounded nice. The act of singing itself was interesting, Feeling my throat rumble with the notes was a new sensation and I swear I could feel my skull vibrate on the higher pitch. When we finished the first song I realized that I had a pleasant buzz swirling about in my head, it felt good to come together with so many people and create something. My anxiousness faded away as I realized that I was actually looking forward to the next one.\n\nThe feeling didn't fade on the second song and by the third I was running out of breath, eventually the service concluded and everyone shuffled out to begin their days in earnest. Alan congratulated me for the performance and asked if I'd be joining them again next week, I agreed before I even realized it. He seemed pleased but I'd definitely need to talk to Trish about rescheduling our sessions. Rosa wasted no time in pushing through the crowd to meet up with me. I thought she'd attack me with another hug but she stopped short and beamed that same motherly smile she had before I started.\n\n\"Eras maravilloso An-on!\" her tone implied she was congratulating me, I sure as hell couldn't speak spanish.\n\nI just smiled \"You were right Rosa, all I had to do was follow their lead.\"\n\nShe nodded sagely at that \"Si, Rosa is always right\"\n\n\"So you said you wanted to catch up?\" I ventured, still riding the high my performance gave me\n\nRosa's eyes lit up as I reminded her \"Of course, Oh I must call Stella!\" She pulled out her phone as she said as much, her phone case was rose themed of course.\n\nShe dialed up her number, put the phone to her ear and waited, and waited. Rosa's brow furrowed as it presumably went to voicemail and immediately dialed the same number. After a few seconds she shouted into it\n\n\"WAKE UP CHICA, IT IS TWELVE! THAT IS THE AFTERNOON!\" I winced at the explosion of sound in front of me, was Stella still asleep or something?\n\n\"Come, we're having lunch... Yes now! \u00a1R\u00e1pidamente! An-on is back!\" she huffed and ended the call before switching on a dime and looking at me with a cheery smile\n\n\"So, Ready to go?\"\n\nI nodded, mildly concerned at what I had gotten myself into.\n\nAfter hashing out the details Rosa offered to drive me to their favorite spot, apparently they ate there once a week anyways. Rosa drove an otherwise boring sedan were it not for the surprisingly tasteful floral print along the side. I'll give it to her, she takes a theme and sticks with it. Admittedly it felt a bit weird to be in such a small vehicle after I got accustomed to the veritable monster truck that was the Trish-mobile. The far too loud spanish music blaring didn't help with the comfort levels either but I wasn't about to tell Rosa how to run her life, I still had mine that I wanted to live.\n\n\"So, uh, what's Stella been up too?\" I tried to make conversation despite the music but Rosa unsurprisingly couldn't hear me.\n\n\"Rosa!\" I half-shouted, still no response\n\n\"ROSA\" I yelled, my vocal cords were still a little sore from their workout at the church but at long last I got her attention\n\n\"Did you say something Ni\u00f1o?\" She asked calmly after turning the music down to something acceptable for human ears\n\nI sighed internally but repeated myself \"How. Has. Stella. Been?\"\n\nRosa clucked her tongue disapprovingly and fished her phone out of her purse, somehow managing to navigate some pages without crashing the car. Having found what she was looking for she handed her phone to me and at last returned her attention to the road. A Yousnoot video? What the hell? Tapping the screen to start the video I could only wonder what Rosa was getting at.\n\n\"Konichiwhat is up! Watashi wa Stella but you already knew that! Gomenasorry for the delay between videos!\" A high pitched distortion of Stella's voice screeched from the tinny speakers. You've got to be fucking kidding me. I can scarcely believe it but it's right there on the little screen, wait this has HOW many views!?\n\nI paused the video to preserve my sanity, I noticed that Rosa was subscribed to Stella surprisingly. Well that was nice of her even if it was a drop in Stella's disturbingly large bucket. Looking at her video history assaulted my eyes with all the colors of the rainbow and far too much anime, no surprise there. Seems like Stella does it all, from reviews to top 10's to reaction videos and every one of them has tens of thousands of views. Oh hey, she even does let's plays... Of JRPG trash. I'm not sure why I expected any different, Stella wouldn't be able to appreciate the true majesty of Rock Ring anyways. Oh my god Stella no, even the polychromatic miniature equines!? I dropped Rosa's phone back in her purse, unable and unwilling to delve further into that portal of antedeluvian evil. Which was just as well as we apparently had arrived.\n\nIt was a completely mundane looking coffee shop, I'm not sure why I expected different but the memory of Stella's horrid japanglish still weighed heavy in my mind. When we entered the shop I was surprised to see that Stella had actually beat us there. The stegosaurus in question was hunched over a cup of coffee, cradling it like her child.\n\n\"I will go get us something, say hi to Stella, An-on\" Rosa's tone didn't really leave room for argument, not that there was ever any arguing with a hispanic woman.\n\nWhen I took a seat across from Stella I was confused at the lack of reaction though as close to her as I was the reason was obvious, the poor girl was asleep. I didn't really have it in my heart to wake her, after all a month ago I too was sleeping well into the afternoon. Looking her over the best word to describe Stella was disheveled. Her once prominent buns were abandoned in favor of a loose, flowing mane of lime green hair that was frosted with bubblegum pink. Despite being asleep she had pretty evident bags under her eyes and a dollop of drool threatened to spill from her lips. Stella was actually wearing her pajama bottoms in public and her baggy shirt was so large that it barely covered her modesty. Despite her clothing being as loose as it was I could clearly see that Stella's less active lifestyle had gotten the better of her, she had put on more than a few pounds. Not to say that she was obese but Stella was always a fat bottomed girl, you know what that's not a productive line of thought. Shaking my head I noticed that she had fluffy dinosaur slippers to complete her ensemble. she looked like somebody plucked her straight from bed, I suppose that's basically what Rosa did though.\n\nSpeak of the devil and she shall appear, Rosa placed a cup of coffee and a bagel in front of me while she and Stella shared a donut. Oh come on, I wanted a donut too! The responsible part of my brain informed me that I already had my treat for the day and any more would spoil me. I told that part of my brain to shut up for telling the truth. Taking a sip of of my coffee I discovered that Rosa had ordered it black, the taste making my face scrunch up. Just how boring did you think I was Rosa? This is some gender stereotyping or something.\n\n\"What do we do about Stella?\" I whispered over to Rosa as she sat down.\n\nRosa looked at Stella with concern clear on her face and sighed \"Let her sleep, her last stream must have been too pogg-ers\"\n\nRaptor Jesus on his cross of rock please strike me down now\n\nRosa clearly saw my expression because she asked \"Was that not correct? I have been watching her internet show and people love to say that\"\n\n\"It was fine Rosa just please never say it out loud, internet culture should stay there.\"\n\n\"I believe that is... Pepe hands?\" she looked very unsure\n\nAt least the table was very cool on my forehead.\n\n\"Ohmygosh! Is that STELLA!?\" An incredibly high pitched squeal sounded from behind me, sitting back up I saw a couple of high school girls approaching at rapid velocity. Based on their number of belts and the ridiculous braces one of them had they were definitely the type to consume Stella's brand of anime. The stegosaur in question had somehow managed to sleep through the school girls siren wail, something I envied as it still left my ears ringing. Seeing little opportunity for anything else I gave Stella a sharp kick, her eyes shot open and she scrambled to get her bearings.\n\n\"Stella we LOVE you!\" The two girls were practically bouncing where they stood in front of Stella.\n\n\"Oh. My. Gosh, yamete kudastoooooop! You guys are just too much!\" Stella didn't miss a beat, waving her hand daintily at them\n\n\"Pleasepleaseplease sign some stuff for us! No one will believe we met you otherwise!\" their chosen canvas was apparently their shirts based on how they were holding them out.\n\n\"Okay you two but I'm here with friends so just the shirts, Is that daijobu?\" Stella kept her tone calm but I could hear an undercurrent of worry\n\nWhen the two of them nodded eagerly Stella gave them a tired smile \"I'd know you'd wakarunderstand.\" She formed a V with her fingers and held it up to her eye which had the girls squealing.\n\nOne signing later we were blissfully free of the underaged, if only the same were true of my himalayan throat singing forum. Stella slumped back into her seat, taking a sip of her drink with eyelids half closed. It was impressive how quickly she assumed character, I was barely considered sentient after waking.\n\n\"You look good, anon.\" Stella murmured over coffee that apparently did little to wake her\n\n\"Oh I know! Si estuviera soltero...\" Rosa decided to chime in, her eyes looking me up and down\n\n\"You're not so bad looking yourself Stella, I like the hair\" I actually did if I was being honest, aposematism didn't really apply to meteor dodgers with how colorful most of them were.\n\nThe corners of Stella's mouth twitched into a smile\n\n\"An-on no! Not you too! Now she'll never get rid of it!\" Rosa has already whipped out her prayer beads to save both of our hedonistic souls\n\n\"It's just hair, Rosa.\" I offered, not really understanding the reaction\n\n\"JUST hair!? Dios mio, such a boy thing to say.\" Rosa muttered\n\n\"So uh, you're a celebrity Stella? Thats really impressive\" I tried my best to ignore her\n\n\"Oh you know, I made videos when I was school. When we graduated I didn't really know what to do with myself so I just kept making more. If you're on Yousnoot for enough years you're bound to get noticed\" Stella's voice was breathy and measured, her expression never shifted from a half-lidded smile.\n\nI forced myself to take another sip of the black coffee Rosa got me, it would be rude to let it go to waste. I gave Stella a suspicious look, there was no way she was still sleepy after that much coffee. I was starting to think she wasn't all that tired and was just taking full advantage of being able to be low energy for once. Having to play a peppy anime character in front of the camera for hours every day must be exhausting.\n\n\"Enough about Stella! Where have you been all these years chico?\" Rosa asked, slapping the table to get my attention.\n\nThe difference in energy between these two was giving me a headache but even Stella perked up at this topic. No real avoiding it anymore then. I did my best to tell them everything I could from the navy, the interesting parts anyways. It was a little strange, I'd been with the navy for years but when I was digging my memory for events to share it only brought up the past month with Trish. In just that month I'd met some truly wacky people, this one guy asked Trish what foods had the least amount of 5g waves in them. Rosa didn't really get it but at least Stella chuckled at that story. There was a woman who complained she drank only juice and yet didn't lose weight, she refused to believe that a glass of apple juice was just as sugary as soda. It wasn't just people being weird about food either. I think my favorite story was actually my first boxing partner, A tyrannosaurus if you can believe it. I let that one sink in, a T-rex boxer. Trish did her best to give him advice but there are just some natural limitations you know? It had a happy ending at least when Trish pointed him towards MMA, that one was less about punching.\n\nWhile we shared a laugh at the misfortune of the T-rex I considered bringing up Fang. She clearly had some problems she wouldn't talk about and I could use some advice. Stella likely wouldn't be any help but Rosa seemed well put together. I opened my mouth to ask her but my voice died on my lips, Fang seemed pretty reclusive. Was it really my place to bring up her problems? Knowing Rosa she might do something drastic and Fang would never forgive me. I closed my mouth, saying nothing felt wrong but airing her dirty laundry didn't feel much better. I satisfied myself with the idea that I could call Rosa up any time and ask her. On that note I needed her number, something both of them were more than willing to part with. My contacts just doubled in one day, woohoo. While I was recording their numbers I gave Stella a sideways glance.\n\n\"So, which horse is best horse?\" I asked nonchalantly.\n\n\"Purple smart\" Stella said with no hesitation\n\n\"Azteca\" Rosa mentioned only a moment later\n\nThey both looked at each other quizzically, oh man that's too perfect.\n\nWe managed to whittle away a few hours sharing memories, Stella had plenty of stories with people embarrassing themselves. One guy was a simp turned stalker that she actually had to call the police on. Rosa talked about her work, she was running a quaint little flower shop unsurprisingly but was studying to become a pastor. One day somebody apparently ate 50 dollars worth of flowers while she was reading. I was more surprised that pastors needed to be so educated than a hungry weirdo if I was being honest. When our conversation took a more casual pace Stella mentioned the three forbidden runes of D, B, Z and Rosa could not be stopped. Glancing at my phone I could see it was just past 4. I still needed to work out, cook and while I'd never admit it I got way into this weight lifting anime with the opening theme that was super catchy. I was about to ask Rosa if she'd be willing to drive me home but the phone vibrated in my hand and Trish's smiling face popped up.\n\nTrish: Enjoy ur day off?\nAnon: You bet, bumped into Rosa today\nTrish: Rly? Where?\nTrish: W8\nTrish: You didn't\nAnon: I did\n\nThe dots appeared and disappeared, seems like she was struggling to say something\n\nTrish: I'm rly impressed\nAnon: Why?\nTrish: I'll explain l8r\nTrish: U busy?\nAnon: Lunch with Stella and Rosa, about to go home\nTrish: Gr8, u should come over\nTrish: Bring Stella and Rosa\nAnon: To your sickbed?\nTrish: I got better\n\nWhat? How the hell did she get better in like seven hours tops? I bet she was just fibbing so she could see Stella and Rosa again. I sighed and shook my head, knowing full well there was no dissuading Trish from anything. Broaching the topic with the two of them proved fruitful, Rosa was an extroverted soul and Stella just seemed grateful for an excuse to keep chilling out. We all piled into Rosa's sedan, apparently Stella lives on the same street and just walked here. I gave Rosa the directions to Trish's house, It was in one of the poorer neighborhoods but it wasn't skinrow and any of us having a proper house at this point was something impressive. Rosa sped off, music blaring loud enough that talking with either of them was pointless. I checked my phone again, still nothing from Fang. My last message to her was just trying to organize one of our smoke dates but...\n\nAnon: Sung at church today, not the same as an instrument but music's fun\nAnon: Met Rosa and Stella too, you should see her new hair!\nAnon: We're meeting up at Trish's place for a little get together\n\nI paused, trying to find the words\n\nAnon: I think it would mean the world to Trish to see you again\nAnon: She's sick today so the meeting would be less intense, no pressure to stay\n\nI tapped out Trish's address for Fang, I didn't really expect anything to come of it but getting Fang involved in my life felt important. Staring down at my messages I felt like there was something missing. Trish and Fang were friends for ten years, that was almost half our lifespan. They were thick as thieves in school and even 5 years later Trish was sobbing and confessing her sins on a bench late at night. I know full well that those tears weren't because of the pain she caused me, She may have felt guilty and she may have regretted it but it's the fact that she hurt Fang that truly weighed on her.\n\nAnon: She never stopped being your friend"},"Perfect Situation Chapter 5.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Perfect Situation Chapter 5.txt"],"text":"Chapter 5: Despair\n\nWhen we finally pulled into Trish's parking lot my skull was pounding. I almost didn't believe it when the silence returned. My world had been consumed by a language I barely understood for so long that the lack of it was a flashbang to the senses. I exited Rosa's car quickly, eager to escape on the chance she turned her horrid music back on. Stella followed after me, looking similarly dazed though she had been looking like that all day. Rosa moved to join us but stopped when she spied the Trigga Truck.\n\n\"Eso es rid\u00edculo\" she shook her head disapprovingly.\n\nAt least I think that's what she said, My ears were still ringing. Following her gaze I was surprised at the appearance of another car parked along side it. That was strange, did she call a doctor or something? She didn't seem sick enough for that but she was definitely a woman concerned for her health. I took the lead and the two of them fell in behind me, I noted that she kept her lawn well maintained. Where on earth did that woman find the time? Stepping up to the door of Trish's modest little home I rapped my knuckles against it. We waited a short while but that was to be expected, I'm sure she had to drag herself out of bed. When the door finally opened Trish seemed ecstatic to see us, I was hit with a wave of nostalgia when I saw she was wearing her old hoodie.\n\n\"Glad you could make it!\" She chirped, pulling me down in a hug that I returned. Spying Rosa and Stella from over my shoulder she gasped and rushed to meet them, throwing an arm around each their necks and pulling them in for another hug.\n\n\"N-nice to see you too, Trish\" Stella squeaked around her bicep\n\n\"It is no coincidence that we are reunited on the day of our lord\" Rosa agreed with full conviction\n\nHaving got her greeting out of the way Trish invited us all inside. Inside her very dark house, where the curtains were drawn and lights were off. I'm sure she was sleeping until now but wasn't somebody else over too? As soon as Trish closed the door and with it the only light source there was a click and the house itself lit up.\n\n\"HAPPY ONE MONTH ANNIVERSARY!\" A chorus of voices called out, some louder than others.\n\nI blinked, reeling from having to rapidly adjust to the light. There were streamers along the ceiling and even a few balloons, A tray of snacks had been laid out and stacks of cans had been set aside on a table. To my disbelief a pink raptor stood up from behind the couch, a grin plastered on his face. Reed!? Somehow he wasn't even the most surprising thing in this room, That was the young girl in the corner. She looked like Trish in miniature, an impressive feat for someone already so small. Why did Trish never mention her? What was all this even for!? My mouth worked, but my brain couldn't decide what was more important. At least Stella and Rosa seemed as confused as I was.\n\n\"Alright, one question at a time\" Trish stood next to me with her traditional smirk, the deja-vu of seeing it paired with her hoodie was intense\n\n\"Daughter?\" I choked out\n\n\"Sister\"\n\n\"Reed?\"\n\n\"Wanted to see you\"\n\n\"Sick?\"\n\n\"You believed that?\"\n\n\"Party?\"\n\nHer smirk softened, resting her hand on my shoulder \"You deserve it, dummy. You know how many people quit their routine in a week? That's just exercise, you've cut down on smoking, you're more confident, you even went to church today! You've come a long way from that trash pile I found you in. You're the best assistant a girl could ask for and you don't make a half bad punching bag either.\" She punctuated it with a slap on the back, it did little to dissuade the warmth growing in my chest or the color in my cheeks.\n\n\"Besides, I like to send a gift basket to people that stick to their plan for a month. It takes two weeks to build a habit but I do a month to be sure. Represents independence y'know? You're just lucky they were out of baskets.\" She sniffed dismissively, she wasn't a very good actor.\n\nI heard clapping from behind me and to my surprise it was Stella.\n\n\"Congratulations\" she said, tilting her head and smiling at me.\n\n\"Congratulations \u00a1ni\u00f1o!\" Rosa clapped excitedly as she followed suit\n\n\"Yeah, congratulations man\" Reed drawled, joining in\n\n\"Congratulations, Anon\" This time it was Trish, politely clapping along\n\n\"Congratulations... I guess...\" Even Trish's sister was peer pressured into it, though she didn't sound very enthused\n\nStanding amidst all this applause I suddenly felt very self-conscious. looking back at the instigator I saw a devious glint in her eye despite her lazy smile, god damnit Stella, you had to do your anime reference even now? Fortunately everyone got their fill quickly enough. Rosa and Stella wasted little time taking the couch so they could sample the snacks. I saw Reed fiddling with a laptop and some speakers, guess it's not a party without music. Trish steered me towards her sister, she was definitely too young for high school but she still had that awkward teenage ganglyness. Middle school then?\n\n\"Sorry about springing this on you, I'm just cautious about Tana meeting new men\" she whispered as she pulled me along\n\n\"What? Why?\" I mumbled back, why men specifically?\n\nShe just pinched my arm, we were too close to Tana now to speak privately. The girl in question looked up at me beneath a long tuft a hair with apathy at best, disdain at worst. I could see studded bracers around her wrist and a distinct lack of color in her apparel, the rebellious type then.\n\n\"Tana, this is Anon.\" Trish's voice was surprisingly motherly, almost too much so, it was like she was talking to a toddler.\n\nTana's expression didn't change as her gaze slid to Trish \"I know, you've talked about him before\"\n\nTrish's smile faltered a bit \"I know but I wanted you two to meet. He's a very good friend of mine.\"\n\nI gave Tana a half-hearted wave, she barely spared a glance my way. This was awkward.\n\n\"I met him. Can I go to my room now?\" she flipped her hair dismissively, voice totally monotone\n\nTrish sighed \"Sure, Tana. Go ahead. Do you want me to read you a story tonight?\" her voice was so fragile, I think story time meant more to Trish than it did Tana.\n\n\"I'm not a little kid anymore, god.\" was Tana's predictable response before she stomped off\n\nIt felt wrong watching a headstrong woman like Trish get utterly trampled by a pre-teen. Trish and I were close at this point but this felt like a side of her that was too intimate to share among friends. I was about to try and cheer her up when Trish sighed.\n\n\"Sorry about that\" she sounded disappointed.\n\nI shrugged at her \"Don't worry about it. Kids are cruel, Trish.\"\n\nTrish cocked her head and looked up at me curiously \"You think so?\"\n\nI nodded seriously \"I am very in touch with my inner child\".\n\nShe looked confused at the implication but I heard Reed howling across the living room, 5 years separated and my bro still had it.\n\n\"Dude, nice!\" he shot me his classic finger gun.\n\nTrish looked exasperated when I returned fire.\n\n\"I need a drink. Why don't you go talk with your boyfriend?\" She grumbled, not bothering to wait for my response before she walked over to the table and cracked open a can.\n\nNot a bad idea honestly, I could use a bit of levity after Tana and I needed to catch up with him anyways. Reed was still hunched over his laptop, tapping away at something with his tail swishing occasionally. I'm not sure what he was doing because he had the music going just fine, some trashy pop song currently. I sat down and grabbed something from the snack tray before Stella and Rosa devoured them all, cheese and crackers, guess you can't go wrong with the classics. Looking at Reed he seemed barely touched by time, his arms had thinned so I guess he stopped playing the drums. Actually at a closer look he seemed thinner in general.\n\nI briefly worried he wasn't getting enough to eat but while Fang was skeletal, Reed just seemed lithe. Maybe it was his posture or maybe it was my virginity talking but it wouldn't be a stretch to call him feminine. Fortunately he finished whatever he was doing and walked over, plopping his fluffy tail in the last remaining seat he held out his fist to me. A fist I gladly met with my own, with the customary finger wiggle after our knuckles parted of course.\n\n\"How's life been treating you, man?\" Reed asked me, still getting comfortable in his seat. Was his voice always this high pitched?\n\nIt was an innocent question but it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had been so distracted by actually living that I hadn't really stopped to consider it. I used to think life was going to treat me like shit and I was going to treat it shit right back. I had convinced myself that I had missed some critical juncture. I looked across to Stella, she had her phone out and was showing Rosa something, the latina caught me staring and shot me a smile. I could see Trish in the kitchen collecting enough cans for everyone, her tail wagging as she did so. Reed was looking at me expectantly, I guess I was taking too long to answer. I was surrounded by old friends that I never expected to see again. It felt good, great even but there was one monochromatic weirdo still missing.\n\n\"Can't complain.\" I said, it was the truth. What I had was more than I deserved.\n\nReed seemed disappointed at such a simple answer \"Yeah, that's usually how it goes\"\n\n\"But I'm not going to stop until it's better\" I added with a grin.\n\n\"Ha! Now that's what I'm talking about!\" He agreed enthusiastically\n\n\"What about you Reed, what have you been up to?\" I was genuinely curious, I always figured he'd be homeless after school.\n\n\"It was real harsh when you and Fang broke it off. She and Trish got into a big argument soon after and then she left. No band without Fang so all I had left was machines y'know? I could get 'em working on the outside but on the inside? Had to practice that. Turns out I was pretty good so I kept doin' it. Eventually I showed some company my stuff and bam I was suddenly employed.\"\n\nI took a moment to process that information, Trish never mentioned a fight. Reed also never mentioned what he actually did.\n\n\"So what do you actually do?\"\n\nReed chuckled \"I'm a programmer, man. Got the socks to prove it.\"\n\nI couldn't help it, I looked down. His legs were covered by pants, socks weren't visible but they could be hiding just beneath the surface...\n\nStella perked up however \"Oh, you are? That's wonderful. I was actually looking to hire one for a project\".\n\nI dared not consider what manner of project Stella needed a programmer for.\n\n\"Sick! You'll have to slide the deets my way\" Reed had no such compulsion it seems.\n\n\"I think this calls for a celebration. Anyone got a light?\" Reed asked, fishing out some home-wrapped nonsense.\n\nI was already reaching for my lighter when Trish appeared behind him and snatched the doobie from his lips.\n\n\"No. Smoking. Indoors.\" She enunciated each word by poking him in the snout with his own joint. I forgot how anal Trish was about smoking.\n\n\"Aww man... \" He was actually pouting.\n\n\"Do you have any idea how hard it is to get the smell of smoke out of a house?\" She asked expectantly, hands on her hips.\n\nNow that she mentioned it, I'm pretty sure I did smell smoke. It wasn't anywhere near fresh, it was the barest suggestion of a cigarette beneath layers of other smells but it was there. Why would Trish's house smell like that? I doubt anyone else could tell, it was only the fact that my apartment smelled just like it that let me notice in the first place. My musing was interrupted with a thud as Trish dropped a box of beer on the now empty snack table. She tossed each of us a can and grabbed one for herself, guess this is what she was drinking in the kitchen. Staring at the can of beer in my hands I felt a sense of trepidation. I certainly had my vices but alcohol was never one of them, that night on the beach made sure of that. No one else seemed too concerned as they each cracked open their prize, We were all friends here right? I could feel my thoughts darken, Fang and I were more than friends and alcohol ruined that too. I forced myself to pop the top before I could dwell too much, Anon Y. Mous refused to be scared of cheap beer. However as soon as I moved my arm off its rest to take a sip Trish planted her stupidly perfect ass on it.\n\n\"Hey! I wasn't using that or anything\" I scoffed, pretending to be upset.\n\nTrish looked down at me for a change \"You see anywhere else to sit?\" she asked, clearly amused.\n\n\"The floors right there\".\n\nShe gently thwapped me with her tail. Fine, be that way.\n\nThe introduction of alcohol seems to have loosened everyone's lips and we quickly lost a few hours to chatter and drinks. Stella and Reed were discussing their project in slow motion, Reed picking up on Stella's lethargy. Trish and Rosa were swapping history until Rosa made the mistake of asking Trish about losing a few pounds. That would keep the two of them busy for a while, I pulled out my phone so I could check on Fang. Read message but no reply, I couldn't prevent the sigh escaping my lips. Shouldn't have gotten my hopes up, it was still too early for her. I debated sending her another text but Reed piped up enthusiastically.\n\n\"Dudes, we should play a party game!\" he looked at everyone for confirmation.\n\n\"I think I have monopoly?\" Trish added unhelpfully, why would you unleash that on your friends?\n\nThankfully Reed shook his head \"Nah, check it. Never have I ever left Volcadera Bluff\"\n\nAh, so it was one of these. I raised my hand and took a drink \"Navy. I'll tell you about it later.\" Most here had heard the story after all.\n\nReed looked excited for that but it was Rosa who spoke up \"Never have I ever been in a fight, Pon la otra mejilla.\" she drew a cross across her chest.\n\nUnsurprisingly Trish and I raised our hands but Reed did as well, we all looked at him questioningly.\n\n\"Look, man. Some people really want their carfe without paying. You know?\" He shrugged nonchalantly as if beating up junkies was totally normal.\n\nMy turn then. \"Never have I ever binge watched an entire series\" I looked at Stella with a knowing grin.\n\nPredictably the stegosaur took a sip and raised her hand \"not fair\" she mumbled. That got a laugh out of everyone.\n\nTrish downed her can and grabbed another, she was really putting those away. Ignoring her head start in the kitchen she was still a few beers ahead of anyone else.\n\n\"Alright I got one\" she took a hearty sip before continuing \"Never have I ever kissed someone\".\n\nShe looked expectantly at us but not a soul raised their hand, not even me.\n\n\"Ohhh noo...\" She moaned, sliding off the armrest and into my lap, hooking an arm around my neck to keep herself upright. I jumped in surprise, Or tried to anyways, she was really heavy for such a small woman. We chuckled at her theatrics but there were going to be questions after something like that.\n\nRosa spoke up first, her voice distraught \"No kisses? Even as a ni\u00f1ita?\"\n\nIt was Reed that answered her \"Nahhhh, Trish beat up boys. She didn't kiss them\"\n\n\"Don't worry Trish, I didn't get my first kiss until prom\" Stella added gently.\n\n\"Ugh, even Stella.\" Trish groaned, practically laying across my lap.\n\nStella puffed up, indignant. \"What do you mean, even Stella!? I do stuff!\"\n\nShe deflated almost immediately when everyone stared at her expectantly.\n\n\"Uhm, Never have I ever done drugs?\" She offered tentatively.\n\nEvery hand in the room shot up, I knew Trish had done carfe and Reed is Reed but Rosa?\n\n\"We are imperfect souls, that is why we need to be saved\" Rosa somehow managed to sound pious about smoking weed. Impressive.\n\nTrish had taken to shifting in her seat, my lap, which had the unfortunate effect of grinding her rear into my crotch. Alright anon, think unsexy thoughts. Why did I have to drink? It was so hard to focus on anything but that warm friction. Eventually she found the right spot, sending an electric current up my spine.\n\n\"Uh, Trish? Could you stop that?\" I grunted, fighting a losing battle against my body.\n\n\"Could you be more comfortable?\" she asked coyly.\n\nDespite her answer she thankfully stopped her ministrations and I could return my attention to the game.\n\nReed opened his mouth to start the new round but Rosa's phone rang, a medley of mexican music drowning out the pop trash Reed had left on. She held it to her ear and let out a flurry of spanish, there wasn't any talking around Rosa when she got going so we waited patiently for her. When she tapped her phone again she smiled apologetically.\n\n\"Sorry everyone, Mi esposo needs me. Ready to head home Stella?\"\n\nThe lime green girl looked hesitant, I didn't blame her. I don't think my ears will ever recover from that car ride with Rosa.\n\n\"Actually, I'd like to stay and talk with Reed about our project. You don't mind driving me home, right Reed?\" She turned her pleading blue eyes on Reed.\n\n\"Not a problem, dudette\" he replied casually, gay or not no man could say no to those eyes.\n\nWith Rosa's absence the mood dampened slightly, She brought a lot of energy to the room. Reed didn't seem dissuaded however.\n\n\"Alright, one more. Never have I ever danced at prom.\" Well that was weirdly specific.\n\nOnly Stella raised a confused hand, I looked at both Reed and Trish curiously\n\n\"Didn't you two go to prom together?\" I asked.\n\nReed shook his head \"technically, but I was the DJ. No time for dancing\"\n\n\"Should've seen my dress..\" Trish muttered bitterly around her can of beer\n\nStella looked apprehensive, I didn't know what to say either.\n\nTrish looked pensive for a moment \"Hold on! I'll be back\" she exclaimed, suddenly excited about something. She stood up on shakey legs and after a moment to get her footing she managed not to stumble her way down the hall. I had gotten so used to her weight and warmth that it felt wrong to have her absent.\n\n\"Yeah, me too actually. Gotta get somethin' from the car.\" Reed stood as well, leaving me and Stella alone.\n\nI leaned back in my seat, head swimming from hours of light drinking. Stella mirrored me, closing her eyes and sighing contently. I had forgotten she was woken up early today and the sun had long set by now. Still, there was something I was curious about.\n\n\"Do you still do tarot readings Stella?\"\n\nStella cracked one eye open but the smile on her face told me she was just being coy \"I see your minds eye is more open to the arcane mysteries, Anon.\"\n\nI was about to ask her why she felt the need to talk like a bad gypsy parody but she pulled out her phone.\n\n\"It's not the same as with a physical deck but the power of tarot lies in the reader not the cards, this program will allow me to divine your fate.\" she intoned ominously\n\n\"Are you having fun, Stella?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She dropped her pretense quickly. \"Would you like a reading?\" There she goes with those eyes again.\n\nAs soon as I nodded she tapped at her screen and furrowed her brow.\n\n\"Reversed Lovers, as your first card this represents indecision. Your lack of commitment will lead to a major imbalance in your life, be honest with your fears and desires.\"\n\nAnother tap of the screen \"Upright chariot, for your own sake you must take decisive action no matter what path you follow.\"\n\nA third tap \"Upright temperance, patience and understanding will ease your journey.\"\n\nShe looked up, eager to hear what I thought.\n\n\"That was a hell of a lot more detailed than the ones you used to give\" I admitted. Impressed that I could actually decipher it while drunk\n\n\"I got better\" she admitted sheepishly, curling some hair around her finger.\n\nI smiled, that was a fun way to kill some time. Lack of commitment? Funny, I was committed to stuff for the first time in a long time. Trusting tarot cards was already silly, trusting digital tarot cards seemed even sillier. Reed returned shortly after my reading, carrying a black box of some kind. I raised an eyebrow but Reed waved me off.\n\n\"You'll see, man.\" He winked at me, setting it down in a corner.\n\nReed kneeled and started fiddling with it so I talked with Stella more. I asked her about tarot and she actually tried teaching me to read the cards themselves. I'm really not sure how Stella managed to get anything coherent from this list of adjectives if I was being honest. Stella seemed more amused than anything at my poor attempts at divining the future but was a patient teacher. Learning tarot actually managed to kill a good 20 minutes. Reed had long since finished setting up his mysterious box and was pestering me for a fortune when I heard Trish call out\n\n\"Heyyyy!\" she slurred enthusiastically\n\nReed looked up with a smile and Stella gasped, putting the phone down I could see why. Trish had apparently spent all that time dressing up, she was wearing an utterly sinful black dress. The top was of a thin black material that let me get a good view of her generous cleavage, the opaque fabric rising halfway up her breasts for modesty. Her crest and horns glittered gold and emerald with expensive jewelry, even her tail had golden rings and chains to complete the set. Following her tail I realized that the swell of her hips made the dress stop at the top of her thighs. Raptor Jesus have mercy upon me. I followed those toned legs all the way down to the black heels she wore.\n\nEager for a second look I realized that her dress was actually tiny. It was clearly a skimpy piece but Trish was a mature woman. Her bust strained her top, her sculpted thighs were depressed by the tight fabric hugging her hips. Her well defined arms and thick shoulder muscles stretched the sheer material nearly transparent, even the faintest outline of her abs could be seen when the cloth hugged her just right. Trish barely fit into that dress, leaving her femininity on full display. As she posed there, hip cocked with a confident smirk on her face I swear I could hear voices from a long forgotten recess of my brain.\n\nThe cheer of electrochemistry was ecstatic. \"Oh yeah baby! We. Are. Back! Mmm, love that rush of testosterone.\"\n\nMy physical instrument roared at me \"What are you doing sitting right now!? What good is that body you've built if it's stationary? >IMAGINE.\"\n\nThe whisper of suggestion curled in my ear \"Look at that woman. She must have dressed up just for you, champ.\"\n\nThe throaty rumble of my ancient reptilian brain demanded one thing. \"BREED.\"\n\nSilencing the cacophony with another sip of beer I struggled to find the right words to describe what I was seeing.\n\n\"Wow.\" I croaked. Good enough.\n\nTrish seemed delighted despite my lack of eloquence. She even struck a pose, lifting her leg and thrusting out her bust and tail for balance. That too small dress of hers hitched up just enough that the blush on my cheeks was almost certainly not from the alcohol.\n\n\"Look at me! Aren't I the 24-year old prom dream?\" She held the pose for just a moment, her smirk giving way to laughter when she stumbled.\n\n\"A really drunk prom dream\" She added with a giggle and joined us in the living room.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye I saw Reed move to his laptop and hit a key. The lights suddenly flicked off, leaving us in total darkness before new ones took their place. A variety of multicolored lights suddenly illuminated room, bathing it in rich reds, blues and greens. Following the streams of light up I could see the bulbs hidden amongst the party streamers. The white noise that was the ambient pop music gave way to something with a thumping bass, with rythm. I didn't get a chance to question it because Trish stepped in front of me.\n\n\"C'mon, Anon. Lets make up for lost time.\" her voice was as gentle as her smile when she offered her hand to me.\n\nI held my hand up to stop her \"Woah, hold on. I can't even dance!\" I tried not to sound as nervous as I felt.\n\nTrish quirked an eyebrow, that smile of hers sharpened into a grin.\n\n\"Then I guess I'll just have to help you won't I?\" she grunted as she grabbed my hand and pulled me out of my seat.\n\nStumbling a little after being yanked to my feet I realized that Trish still hadn't let go of my hand. Standing next to her beneath the light I could see her dress actually sparkled. Maybe I was just drunk but I could swear her eyes sparkled too.\n\n\"Wouldn't be the first time.\" She murmured, her grin still playful.\n\nMy dance lesson with Trish wasn't much of a lesson, I don't think Trish really knew how to dance either. It didn't seem to matter, maybe it was the alcohol or maybe it was the company but we had fun. Stella was more nervous than I was, once we got her groovin' I swear she was mimicking magical girl transformations. Not that I was any better in the cringe department, one of the songs playing sounded a bit like rythm heaven ringside so my drunk ass struck a pose like the wrestler. Trish thought that was hilarious and started doing it too, shame we were missing a third pillar man. In-between songs I went for another beer but discovered we managed to go through the entire case. while I was shaking cans to see if any had some of the golden nectar remaining, the music shifted tone. The notes were long and slow, a woman sung about love lost and found, I could feel a hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"No proms complete without a slow dance, one more?\" Trish pleaded, tugging me back to our makeshift dance floor.\n\nTrish pressed herself against me and my arm wrapped around her waist unconsciously. Her hand found mine and we began to sway with the music. Her ample chest squished against me as her body molded around mine. In contrast to the calm music I could feel her heart beating rapidly and mine was no better. As we slowly danced throughout the room I realized that the light was playing on the air itself. Wait, was that fog? It was! A wispy layer of fog caressed our feet and tufts rose up to meet us. Following their movement lead my gaze back to the black box, Reed you sly son of a bitch. I swiveled my head to find him but he and Stella mysteriously disappeared, The barest rumble of a car starting could be heard.\n\nGuess that left me and Trish alone for the night, it had felt that way since 'prom' started anyways. Our song had ended but a new one had begun before we could decouple ourselves. Trish didn't seem to mind much so I didn't see a reason to stop. We danced and swayed among the fog clouds, the lights flickering between them. Trish murmured something I couldn't hear despite the soft music we were listening to.\n\n\"Hm?\" I prodded her.\n\n\"Thanks for tonight\" she admitted.\n\n\"Why thank me? You were the one who threw the party\" I reminded her, Now I was the one who got to give the 'you're dumb' look.\n\nTrish was silent for a few moments \"Yeah, okay. You can thank me now.\"\n\nDespite the fact that she was clearly joking I couldn't help myself.\n\n\"Thank you, Trish. For tonight, for everything.\" I replied earnestly, hugging her a little tighter. I hope she knew I meant it.\n\nTrish chose not to say anything, instead she intertwined her fingers with mine and rested her head against my shoulder. Our height difference more apparent than ever, I could easily see right over her. Her tail was swaying far too fast for it to be the music, was she actually wagging it? Things slowly started falling into place despite my clouded mind. The handholding, the slow dancing, the tail wagging.\n\nDid Trish like me?\n\nSo many past events redefined themselves, it had all become so obvious. Yet there was still one question unanswered.\n\nDid I like Trish?\n\nShe pulled me out of my apathy, she was my partner, she was my coach, she was my friend. Why even ask that? Why wouldn't I like Trish? Almost as if sensing my thoughts she pulled her head off my shoulder. She didn't say anything, her eyes merely gazed into mine. The song ended but as a new one began neither of us moved. The world seemed to have faded away until nothing remained but the woman in front of me. Her gentle breath, the warmth of her bosom, her hand around mine, the faint scent of perspiration mingled with a feminine deodorant, her pleading diamond pupils. A distant voice was calling me from somewhere within my mind, trying to tell me something. My hazy mind just couldn't find it, Lost within her amethyst prisms I couldn't find myself.\n\nThe spell was broken when she slowly, hesitantly, closed her eyes. She tilted her snout upward, lips slightly parted. Trish was so sure, so confident in everything she did but here she was waiting for me. I slowly leaned down to meet her, the difference in height between us making the journey last painfully long. The back of my mind itched again, one final warning that was lost when my lips brushed against hers. All that mattered then was that we were connected, my lips tingled as we experimented with each other. Her shorter snout requiring only a little finesse to get used too. I could feel her horn brushing against my cheek occasionally, smooth and cool against my flush skin.\n\n\"Ow!\" I broke off from her on instinct.\n\nTrish gasped \"Sorry! Sorry!\" she immediately cupped my face, trying to inspect the damage.\n\n\"I'm fine! I just thought you poked my eye out there\" I reassured her, resting my hand over hers.\n\nWe shared a nervous laugh, both of us unsure where to go from here.\n\n\"Try again?\" Trish asked, her cheeks tinged with color.\n\n\"You need the practice\" I concluded, relishing in the fact that her blush deepened.\n\nOur next few kisses were tentative and chaste, mindful not to repeat the last incident. With practice came confidence, with confidence came passion and I quickly learned just how passionate Trish truly was. She leapt into my arms and crossed her legs around my waist, unwilling to be even slightly apart. The beads on her jewelry rattling as she kissed me like every moment could be the last. I tried and failed to keep up with her hungry lips, she peppered my jaw and neck with kisses when I was too slow. Dimly I recalled what Trish admitted earlier tonight, she must have been craving intimacy for years. I smiled into her lips, happy to let her vent her frustrations on me.\n\n\"My room-\" She moaned \"is the last one-\" she kissed my cheek \"down the hall\" she finished, her breath hot and heavy in my ear.\n\nThe room was dark, the furniture was cluttered and I had a hornier than usual triceratops in my arms. I slowly made my way down the hall but drunk as I was managed to lose balance. Accidentally slamming Trish into the wall didn't seem to hurt her so when she gasped at the impact I took full advantage of her exposed neck. She cradled my head and moaned, urging me to continue ravishing incredibly fine scales there. Unable to control a primal urge within me I bit down hard enough to leave an imprint of my teeth in her flesh. She gasped, impossibly it felt like her grip tightened in response to me. I kissed her new mark and my lips traveled back to hers, I could feel a damp spot growing where her legs wrapped around my waist.\n\nNewly inspired to take my conquest to the proper breeding ground I reluctantly pulled off the wall and continued on to her room. Pushing open the door we nearly tumbled to the floor, the look she gave me when I dropped her on the bed told me I was going to fuck this dinosaur. Momentarily free of Trish I started stripping my clothes, damned vest, why did I have to wear layers? Trish watched me hungrily as more and more of my clothes found their way to the floor. Crawling onto the bed and between Trish's thighs our lips were reunited once again. I could feel her breasts brushing against me with her heavy breaths, they had teased me long enough. Grabbing the hem of her top I yanked it down, at long last freeing her expansive chest. The sheer fabric that still covered her breasts did nothing to preserve her modesty, the sight left me painfully hard. Taking a diamond-hard nipple into my mouth I grinded my length against her, neither of us able to contain our moans. Her lacy black panties were utterly soaked and her tiny prom dress had scrunched up around her waist, giving me full access.\n\nI trailed butterfly kisses from her breast, down her stomach, to her womb, and finally on her panties. Trish gasped and squeezed her powerful thighs around my head at the sensation. I slowly peeled her underwear down her thighs, the material sticky with her juices. Doing so exposed her arousal to the air and left my head swimming. I didn't have it in me for any more foreplay, my body was screaming at me to let nature take its course. Positioning myself at her entrance I looked at Trish for confirmation, the brief reprieve seemed to give her a moment of clarity. She reached over to her dresser, fumbling a bit until she pulled out a condom. Normally I'd question why she had that but normally I wasn't sharing a bed with a naked woman. Tearing the package and awkwardly covering my tool I bent over her and placed a gentle kiss on her lips.\n\n\"Ready?\" I asked breathily.\n\n\"Mhm\" came her nervous reply.\n\nAs I entered her for the first time. Her tightness seemed simultaneously welcoming and resistant, I groaned as I slowly sunk my length into her. Watching her face switch from apprehension to pleasure as I bottomed out inside her felt as good as actually hilting her. I paused a moment, both to let her adjust and to give me a moment to try and cool down despite her sweltering insides. When she nodded I pulled out and thrusted against her in one motion, the sensation sent my head spinning. Trish gasped when I did, arching her back off the bed as her body practically begged for my touch. I thrust into her purposefully, grinding my length inside her to reach her deepest depths. Each time my hips met hers she would moan my name. Bottoming out inside her I paused just long enough to place a kiss on one of her breasts. That was all the time she needed.\n\nHer hands that were gripping the bedsheet found my shoulders and I suddenly found myself beneath her. Her eyes were aflame with a hunger that was focused entirely on me. She sat up, putting her breasts on full display and letting my member slide out of her. She immediately sat back down, grinding her slick entrance up and down my length.\n\n\"T-Trish?\" I gasped at the sensation.\n\nTrish leaned down with a predatory smile, her breath smelled of cheap beer and I could feel her lips brushing against my ears.\n\n\"Call me mommy.\" Arousal was dripping from her voice.\n\nShe started rolling her hips back and forth, Any thought but thrusting back against her was lost to me. Trish smirked and picked up the pace, her breasts bouncing with the rhythm. I bit my lip, willing myself to hold on just a little longer but with Trish controlling the tempo it was impossible.\n\n\"I'm about to-\" I moaned\n\nShe immediately grabbed my cock and slid it inside her. Her hips never stopped bouncing, the lewd sounds of flesh clapping and the sudden tightness were too much for me. My world exploded and left me numb to everything but the woman spasming on top of me. Coming down from my high I saw a self satisfied smile on Trish's face. I think she came just from the idea of being cummed inside. We held each other, basking in our afterglow while reality slowly reasserted itself.\n\n\"I needed that\" Trish sighed happily.\n\nI think I did too, I was feeling refreshed and... Really tired.\n\n\"I kind of want a cigarette, you see it in the movies all the time\" I admitted.\n\n\"Not in the house\" Trish scoffed.\n\n\"Yes, mommy\" I couldn't help but snicker as her eyes widened.\n\n\"Not a word of that to anyone\"\n\nThe world had started spinning, the alcohol was catching up with me. I just answered her with a smooch on the snout, right below the horn. Her face scrunched up but she giggled and planted a wet return kiss on my nose. Her bed was so much softer than it had any right to be, It was getting harder and harder to keep my eyes open. I could hear the rustling of fabric as Trish wagged her tail, I thought about teasing her but yawned instead. Taking a deep breath the days events seemed to sink in, so much had changed today hadn't it? Closing my eyes and letting sleep take me, I rested easy knowing it was finally over.\n\nBzzt\n\nBzzt\n\nBzzt\n\nI barely cracked my eye open, the eyelid far too heavy. Who the hell was calling me at this hour? I wasn't even sober yet. Carefully extracting myself from Trish's grip without waking her I scrambled for the phone before THAT woke her. Fumbling about in the dark for my slacks I eventually followed the buzzing and turned on the phone. It was 2AM, did Stella leave something behind? I tapped open my messages and it felt like a jolt of electricity lanced my heart and raced up my spine. I wasn't feeling tired anymore.\n\nFang: I'm here."},"Perfect Situation Chapter 6.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Perfect Situation Chapter 6.txt"],"text":"Chapter 6: Hang On\n\nI stared at the phone for a few moments, my eyes adjusting to the glare amidst the darkness. Do I text her back? Do I wake up Trish? Why the hell is she even here this late, I sent that text nearly ten hours ago! From Trish's room I could the dull thudding of someone banging on the front door. She was really insistent on this wasn't she? I glanced back at Trish to see her sleeping soundly despite Fang's best attempts to wake us. We've got work tomorrow, if Fang is willing to meet her again then she could do it when its not two in the morning. Until then I can go see what Fang wants, I tried not to think about the fact that the guilt roiling in my stomach heavily influenced that plan.\n\nFang and I haven't been dating for years so it wasn't cheating right? It may have been correct but the thought didn't really soothe me when I slept with Trish just as Fang and I started talking again. Another pang of guilt, this time for Trish, why was I thinking like this? It's not like I wasn't into her. Technically I was the one who kissed her last night! Ugh, I didn't have time to think about this, With no other plan I started stumbling in the dark trying to put on my pants and button up my shirt. God damn fucking dress shirt why do you have so many of them? The thumping had gotten more insistent and my phone vibrated once again, fuck it who needs a fully buttoned shirt?\n\nI opened and closed the bedroom door as quiet as I could, I had to make sure not to wake up both Trish and Tana. Wait, did Tana hear everything last night? I winced as memories of slamming Trish into the wall resurfaced, what the hell were we thinking? Walking by the veritable mountain of discarded cans seemed to have answered my question. I grimaced at them as I passed, alcohol and I really do not get along. The knocking was much louder in the living room. All of our 'prom' lights were still on and the playlist had repeated back to the thumping dance music. Guess that explained why Fang thought we were still awake, I made sure to turn off both before heading to the front door. Pulling it open revealed a disheveled ptero-girl who looked decidedly pissed off.\n\nShe started to yell \"What took-!\"\n\nMy hand shot forward and snapped her snout shut, the look she gave me was both incredulous and furious. I could feel her struggle to talk despite my desperate attempt to shush her, I held a finger to my lips.\n\n\"People are ASLEEP, Fang!\" I stage whispered as I pushed past her, quickly shutting the door behind me before I finally released my grip.\n\n\"One.\" She held up an index finger, eyes narrowing \"don't ever do that again.\"\n\n\"Two.\" There's the second finger \"don't ever do that again\".\n\n\"three-\"\n\n\"Don't ever do that again?\" I interrupted her impatiently, it was too late at night for a lecture.\n\nShe didn't look impressed, crossing her arms with a half empty bottle of vodka in one of her hands.\n\n\"Fang, it's four hours from sunrise. Why are you drinking?\" I tried to move the conversation along.\n\nShe shrugged and took a swig, murmuring around the bottle \"Well I thought I was going to a party.\"\n\nI tried not to sound exasperated \"you're late, everyone went home hours ago.\"\n\nFang withdrew the liquor from her lips and cocked her head \"but not you?\"\n\nHer tone wasn't accusatory but it still made my heart sink, should I tell her what happened?\n\n\"I got a little drunk, Trish let me stay the night.\" I replied with a shrug, that was still the truth.\n\nFang looked me up and down, eyes lingering briefly on my unbuttoned shirt.\n\n\"Yeah, I can see that.\" She held up the bottle for another drink before asking \"you still a fucking asshole when you're drunk?\"\n\nShe said it so nonchalantly, like it was a natural question. I think that hurt more than if she was actually trying to upset me.\n\n\"No, didn't ruin any friendships tonight.\" I shook my head, hoping I was right.\n\n\"First time for everything then.\" she replied casually.\n\nI sighed and sat down on the front step, rubbing my aching eyes of sleep. To my surprise Fang sat down beside me, the feathers of her wings brushing briefly against my shoulder. I grimaced when I saw just how thin her plumage really was, this close to her a few bald spots were visible on her wings. I frowned knowing she wouldn't answer if I tried to bring it up, at least there was one thing I could talk to her about.\n\n\"So what're you gonna do now that you missed the party?\"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow at me \"I didn't miss shit, party's still here.\"\n\nI looked around the darkened porch, no dancers or DJ's sprung out of the ground so I just pointed at myself.\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"You see anyone else?\" Fang droned as if the answer was obvious\n\nI yawned, leaning against the door before mumbling my reply \"not much of a party\"\n\nshe shook what remained in her bottle and answered \"Well I'm drunk and you're drunk, I think that counts.\"\n\nI chuckled \"We're both drunk and we're not screaming at each other, look how far we've come.\"\n\nFang laughed too, bitterly, but she laughed.\n\n\"Oh yeah? Well you've seen the depressing shit I do, how far have you really come?\"\n\nI scratched the back of my head, embarrassed to admit it. \"Well, I've just sort of been working with Trish the past month.\"\n\nFang looked pensive at that, I'm not entirely sure why.\n\n\"Got a smoke?\" Fang switched gears, holding out a hand and looking at me expectantly.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure I've paid you back three times over, Fang\" I complained, feeling around for them.\n\nShe simply smirked and gestured 'gimme' with her fingers.\n\nPopping open the pack revealed that it was mostly full, guess I really have been cutting back on smoking. Not of my own volition, that's for damn sure. I Slid one out for fang and one for myself, time to rectify that. Pulling out my cheap lighter I noticed that it was practically empty, guess I forgot to replace it. Thankfully I still managed to spark a flame even if it took a few attempts. Taking that first drag relaxed me in a way I can't describe, it had been too long.\n\n\"You forgetting someone?\" Fang stared at me expectantly with an unlit cigarette between her lips.\n\n\"Right, sorry.\" I apologized, handing the lighter over to her.\n\nShe clicked it once, twice, thrice, her expression growing more and more irritable until she eventually just tossed it to the side and looked to me, clearly annoyed.\n\n\"Hold still\" she grumbled around the filter.\n\nShe leaned inches away from my face as she held the tip of her cigarette to the glowing end of mine. Fang positioned her hand carefully to shield the fragile ember from the wind as she shared my flame. I could feel my heartbeat pick up when she did, Fang tended to value her personal space during our smoke dates. Maybe it was the alcohol? A new wave of guilt crashed against me as I thought of Trish alone in her bed while Fang and I 'partied'. Why was I so torn up about this? Once Fang lit her cigarette I quickly looked away, trying to settle the warring feelings within me. That's when I caught sight of a shadowed figure turning the corner. A figure that even from a distance I could tell was far too small.\n\n\"Tana!?\" I called out to them\n\n\"No shit?\" Fang murmured quietly beside me\n\nThe person hesitated, that was a good sign I was right. When they walked over to meet us it was confirmed. Tana was smart enough to wear a dark hoodie, whether for warmth or for camouflage I didn't know. From where she walked in it was clear she was returning rather than leaving. I didn't know whether I should be upset at her sneaking out or grateful that doing so meant she didn't hear me and Trish. Surprisingly Tana seemed more annoyed than worried about being caught, in fact she was glaring at me.\n\n\"What are you still doing here?\" she huffed.\n\nI took a calming drag of my cigarette before answering. \"Could ask you the same thing.\"\n\n\"Uh, I live here?\" Tana replied, sassy as ever.\n\n\"You know what I mean, smartass.\" I plucked the menthol from my lips \"don't you have school in the morning?\"\n\n\"Don't you have work?\" She spat, trying her best to turn the tables on me.\n\n\"Yep.\" I replied, hooking a thumb towards Fang \"but a late arrival woke me up.\"\n\n\"Dig the new look, Tana\" Fang grinned, nodding in approval.\n\nTana seemed to notice Fang for the first time, it took a few seconds before the realization dawned in her eyes.\n\nShe gasped \"Lucy? Is that really you? When did you get so... Cool!?\"\n\nI winced at that but Fang physically recoiled, neither of us had heard that name in years.\n\nFang tried to act nonplussed \"actually, I go by Fang now\".\n\n\"Wait, you can change your name?\" Tana asked, surprise still evident in her voice.\n\n\"Hell yeah you can! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise!\" Fang shouted and pumped her arm\n\nTana's face quickly screwed up in thought \"Okay, call me... Horny! No wait, that's terrible. Queen! Hm... Warrior?\"\n\nI shot Fang a disapproving look but she was waiting patiently for Tana to finish, the sincere smile on her face was almost enough to make me feel guilty for trying to dissuade her.\n\n\"Okay, I've decided.\" The tiny triceratops said it with a surprising amount of confidence \"My new name is Spike.\"\n\nI brought the cigarette to my lips and gave 'Spike' a few moments to bask in her decision.\n\n\"Well, you may be purple but you don't look like much of a dragon to me\" I added, exhaling the smoke in my lungs\n\nThey both just stared at me, tough crowd.\n\n\"Blame Stella\" I deflected with a shrug.\n\nFang ignored me and looked to Tana, grinning around her menthol \"Don't mind the dweeb, Spike. It's a good name.\"\n\nTana tried her best to hide just how pleased she was that Fang complimented her. I'd bet Trish would kill to have that kind of respect from her sister. It's a little strange though, shouldn't Tana be with their parents? She could just be visiting I suppose but she has a 'room' that she snuck out of. I was about to ask her about it when she surprised me by squeezing between Fang and I, this doorstep was getting really crowded now.\n\n\"Tana-\" I started but Fang shot me a disapproving look of her own. \"Spike, we're smoking. It's bad for your lungs\"\n\nTana scoffed, I fully expected her to bring up the hypocrisy over the fact that we were smoking ourselves. Instead she reached into her hoodie and pulled out a single slightly bent cigarette of her own.\n\n\"Anyone got a- Hey!\" Fang snatched it from her before Tana could react.\n\n\"It's bad for your lungs\" Fang repeated my words with surprising authority.\n\nWhile Tana looked upset she didn't argue with Fang. Seeing my moment I cleared my throat to get her attention.\n\n\"If you go to bed I wont tell Trish about tonight\" I tried my best to sound amicable.\n\nTana practically sneered at me, either she didn't take well to bribes or she was just that spiteful.\n\n\"Go to bed, Spike. It's a good deal.\" Fang thankfully backed me up.\n\n\"But...\" Tana started to protest but she withered underneath Fang's stare \"We're going to talk again... Right?\"\n\nThat fragile question was the first time she sounded like the little girl she actually was.\n\nFang smiled plaintively \"We'll see, good night.\"\n\nTana lingered a few moments more before standing up and entering her home, the door closing with a soft click. I was surprised that Fang handled that so well, I never took her for the 'motherly' type. She didn't look much like one either with a loose fitting black tank-top contrasting her pale feathers or the ragged jeans she wore with a hole torn across the knee. Unlike what she used to wear I was fairly certain that was due to actual age rather than a stylistic choice. A variety of charms hung from a collection of necklaces across her neck, the meaning of them lost to me much like the symbolism behind the tattoo's adorning her shoulders.\n\nI yawned, the late hour getting the better of me. \"When did we become parents?\"\n\n\"We?\" Fang raised an eyebrow, smirking at me \"I'm pretty sure I did all the work there.\"\n\n\"You two clearly knew each other, unfair advantage.\"\n\nFang didn't offer a response to my sleepy rebuttal, instead she replaced the cigarette I gave her with the one she liberated from Tana. Guess that explained the mysterious smell of smoke in the house. Fang swapped the embers between them and glanced back at me curiously.\n\n\"Why'd you send me Trish's address anyways? You think I didn't know?\"\n\n\"I thought you two had a falling out?\" I asked, just as curious.\n\n\"It's hard to forget ten years.\" She answered bitterly.\n\nTen years? So she lived here back in school?\n\n\"Can't believe she still lives here, Trish really hated her mom.\" Fang added absently, unaware of the missing puzzle piece she just provided me\n\nNow even my sleep and booze addled mind could manage to put things together. Trish was an incredibly young home owner, who lived alone with a rebellious little sister, who's mother I've never seen or heard about. I couldn't stop the frown from forming on my face, this was a hell of a realization to have at two in the morning. Trish never talked about this, she didn't talk about Tana either, why was Trish so secretive about her home life? Something to ask her in the morning I suppose, until then I'm keeping Fang company. The ptero in question seemed to be just as lost in thought as I was. Staring at her in the moonlight I noticed something that brought a smile to my face, she seemed to have gained a little weight. It wasn't much but at least she wasn't quite so skeletal, guess our smoke dates paid off.\n\nThe wind picked up sending chilly night air gusting past us, the breeze tousling Fang's hair ever so slightly. Wait, her hair? I noticed that she had let some grow in but figured she was just waiting. The barest hint of locks splayed across her scalp, it was far too much hair for her to be between shaves. Fang was changing her style and while it may have been nothing it felt like a positive change to me. One moment I blinked and the next my eyes were locked with two amber pupils, she had caught me staring. It felt like I should've looked away or apologized, instead a deepseated calm within me told me to hold her gaze.\n\nI gestured towards her hair \"You're growing it out?\"\n\nFang ran a hand over her head, tousling what little hair she had before replying. \"You like it?\"\n\nI nodded \"yeah, I do.\"\n\n\"Why?\" She sounded suspicious \"Because it makes me look feminine?\"\n\nThat was a loaded question, one that if answered poorly could spell disaster. One that, at least tonight, I felt confident walking into.\n\n\"Yep\" I answered casually, it was the truth after all.\n\nThe fact that I so boldly admitted it took the wind from her sails, that lasted for only a moment before I could see anger form on her face. It wasn't a vivid or righteous rage, it was the look of a woman who was tired of explaining, tired of hoping people would remember.\n\n\"I'm-\" Fang started with a sigh\n\n\"After all\" I continued, her expression tightened but she let me speak \"Someone very important to me once said that non-binarys don't owe people androgyny\"\n\nWhen her anger immediately evaporated into confusion and then realization I let an easy smile come over me, you still got it Anon. Fang looked away from me so I couldn't see her own smile, a truly genuine one that had been absent far too long.\n\n\"You...\" She started, her voice a gentle rasp.\n\n\"I...\" Fang tried again, struggling to find the words\n\nThe ptero-girl took a few seconds to gather her thoughts before she turned to me, those citrine orbs of hers were heavy with the kind of tired that sleep couldn't fix.\n\n\"Why are you doing this?\" She asked with quiet exasperation.\n\n\"You'll have to specify\" I laughed a little nervously, unsure what she meant.\n\n\"Everything.\"\n\nFang was searching my eyes for something, cigarette hanging loosely from her lips. \"You show up in my life after years, let me scream at you and then disappear just like you did before? But just as I'm starting to forget you again, you show up arm in arm with my ex best-friend.\"\n\nHer voice was starting to gain strength now that she was lost in her memories. \"But you're not dating her, that would have made things too simple. Instead you started to talk with me, it wasn't even some plan to get me in your bed either.\"\n\nShe dug a hand into her pocket and pulled out an old phone, battered and marred with a noticeable crack across the screen. Between that and the scratched screen it looked like she'd either dropped or thrown that phone more than once.\n\n\"Then\" Fang tapped the screen and brought up a chat history I recognized \"You just wanted to talk more. You kept sending messages, you kept telling me how you were doing, asking how I was doing.\"\n\nFang was starting to look as aggravated as she sounded, her feathers bristling. \"I kept thinking you were playing some long con! That I'd eventually figure out what you were doing!\"\n\nThe building energy within her proving to be too much until she was forced to hug herself, the sharp talons on her hand digging into her arms hard enough that I could see a bead of crimson forming in the depression.\n\n\"I never did\" she admitted, her voice falling to nearly a whisper\n\n\"Why?\" She repeated dejectedly, looking fraught in the dim blue glow of her phone \"what do you want from me?\"\n\nI sat there, my mind slowly unpacking everything that Fang told me. We stared at one another in silence aside from the low hum of insects and Fangs slightly labored breathing. What did I want from her? It would be a lie to say that I didn't want things to go back to how they were, when we were together and I didn't ruin our lives. But that was a shallow desire, we all wanted to go back and fix our mistakes. What did I want from Fang right now? Why did I go through so much effort for her? Why was I on this porch in the middle of the night?\n\n\"Because I want you to be happy.\" I admitted, It really was that simple wasn't it?\n\nFang didn't seem to think so, she was waiting expectantly but there wasn't any more to say.\n\nI frowned at her \"Is that so hard to believe?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She wasn't making a joke, she was stating a fact.\n\nThe cigarette couldn't soothe the pain that one word caused me, not that there was much of it left anyways. I flicked the butt to the pavement and crushed it while I recovered from what I deserved. My mind was desperate to find something to say, something important or dramatic. Just like in the pizzeria there was nothing I could say that sounded right. Fang had apparently decided that was all she was going to get from me and started scrolling through our texts. To think that those mundane and seemingly unimportant conversations were what she cared so much about.\n\n\"Look, Fang. I don't have some speech prepared for you.\" I wet my lips, unsure where to begin.\n\n\"You were the first person that I ever connected with, It's thanks to you that I've got some of the happiest moments of my life.\" My heart was screaming at me to stop exposing it but I forced myself to continue.\n\n\"Our lives had gotten intertwined so fast I didn't know what to do. I had spent my whole life alone and then four months into the year I found myself in l-love with a girl that loved me back.\" I cringed internally over my stutter, saying that word felt awkward after so long. I could feel Fang's eyes boring into me but I couldn't bring myself look at her. Not until I was finished.\n\n\"So I got afraid, I tried to disconnect myself. I convinced myself that what we had wasn't important, that you were too flawed. I tried to go back to what I had before, what was comfortable.\" The words kept flowing from my lips, things I had always known but didn't dare dwell on.\n\n\"Of course I want you to be happy Fang.\" I finally found the strength to meet her eyes with mine. \"Because I think no matter what, a small part of me will always love you. I'm sorry it took me this long to realize it.\"\n\nI all but whispered my last confession. Fang held my gaze, her amber eyes had lost some of their brilliance but looking into them took me years in the past. Those eyes took me to a rooftop that overlooked the city, to the girl sitting across me, to the same smile she wore now. It was a smile that I couldn't help but mirror.\n\n\"Okay.\" Fang matched my whisper with her own.\n\n\"Okay?\" I repeated hesitantly.\n\n\"I'm so tired, Anon.\" Fang answered softly, pausing to take a deep breath of the cool night air \"I'm so tired of work, tired of bills, tired of debt, tired of drugs, tired of being alone.\"\n\n\"I'm tired of hating you\" she rubbed her shoulders uncertainly \"So I forgive you, okay?\"\n\nMy chest warmed with a fire that I had no hope of controlling. I just nodded, I couldn't trust my voice and hoped she didn't hear the sniffle that almost certainly escaped me.\n\n\"So.\" I tried and failed to hide the emotion choking up my voice \"We're starting over?\"\n\nFang gave a slight nod \"Yeah, I guess we are.\"\n\nI stiffly thrust my hand out to her and cleared my throat.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Anon.\"\n\nFang chuckled at my antics \"stop being such a dweeb, dweeb.\"\n\nAnon Y. Mous wouldn't be deterred though, I waited patiently for my hand shake. Eventually I was treated to the view of her slowly accepting that fact, from the shake of her head to her lips curling into a smile. After that, it didn't take long before she grasped my hand in hers, shaking it gently.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Lucy.\""},"Perfect Situation Chapter 7.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Perfect Situation Chapter 7.txt"],"text":"Chapter 7: Jacked Up\n\n\"Lucy, huh?\" I raise an eyebrow \"You look an awful lot like an old friend of mine.\"\n\nFang releases my hand, her sharp nails tickling my skin. She looks thoughtful and taps her chin a few times, appearing to ponder something.\n\n\"That's certainly a coincidence.\" She quickly adopts a grin \"Why don't you tell me about them?\"\n\n\"well, They were easily the most talented musician I knew-\"\n\nFang snorted, interrupting me \"If that's the case then you should listen to them these days.\"\n\nI was admittedly interested but I couldn't resist the chance to call her on the mistake \"So you know Fang too, Lucy?\"\n\n\"Alright, you can stop calling me that now\" Fang groaned, screwing her face up in disgust \"makes me sound like some old lady.\"\n\nI snickered at her reaction \"Fang, I hate to be the one to tell you this but you do sound like an old lady.\"\n\nAs soon as the words left my mouth I regretted it. I had grown so comfortable I didn't even think about teasing her. There was a moment just long enough for my heart to drop over the horrible mistake before Fang's cackling caught me off guard.\n\n\"No thanks to you!\" She ramped up her natural rasp to comical levels \"who's been feeding me smokes the past month?\"\n\n\"It's really not that bad\" I reassured her, stifling a laugh.\n\n\"Oh it is, but at least I'm not alone\" She flicks her finger up and down, gesturing to my clothes \"You look like someone's dad! Where did you even get this stuff?\"\n\nI glanced at my attire, Just simple brown slacks, and a white dress shirt only buttoned up halfway. I grimace as I notice a beer stain marring the otherwise pristine shirt. When did that get there? More importantly, why had I not fixed this shirt by now?\n\n\"What's wrong with them?\" I grumble as I fiddle with the buttons.\n\n\"You look like you lost your soul in a cubicle\" Fang looked me over once more \"that didn't actually happen, right?\"\n\nI scoffed at the thought and shook my head \"Nah, you think Trish and I could look this good if we sat down all day?\"\n\nThe primal urge bubbled within me, something inherent and masculine. Perhaps it was the alcohol that hadn't fully left my system or perhaps it was the presence of a female in my midst but I couldn't resist it. My arm curled, my fist clenched and I flexed for all I was worth. I shot Fang a smirk behind the bulging bicep, I could practically envision the anime-esque glimmer on my teeth as I did. Unlike my old clothes, this new shirt was well fitted so that rather than hiding the muscle it stretched and teased the physical perfection beneath. Oh yeah, I was looking good!\n\n\"Down boy\" Fang remarked dismissively but she wasn't fooling anyone with that smile.\n\nChuckling and a little embarrassed I quit showing off and actually answered her \"Trish is a personal coach, remember? She hired me on as a sort of in the field secretary that her clients can punch.\"\n\nFang brought the cigarette to her lips instead of responding, clearly lost in thought about something.\n\n\"You know, like boxing? She's got a program for it\" I threw a few half-hearted punches at the air to emphasize.\n\nThat seemed to snap her out of her reverie \"Trainer, huh? She always was good at telling people what to do.\"\n\n\"That's what I said!\"\n\nWe shared a good-natured laugh at her expense, at least, I think we did. Something in Fang's expression seemed... Dark.\n\nNow that the pressures of our conversation had eased, it felt like a time capsule back to my youth. If I closed my eyes it was all too easy to imagine Fang and I back in school, like we never missed a beat, like we never spent years bitter and alone. Oh wow, closing my eyes turned out to be a horrible idea. The exhaustion suddenly caught up with me all at once, I checked my phone for the time. How did we manage to spend an actual hour on this porch? A titanic yawn gripped me, it's not like I got many hours of sleep to begin with. Fang wasn't safe either as once mine finished she too was forced to yawn. Even as sleepy as I was I couldn't help but be impressed, fang had one hell of a yawn with a snout that long. Looking at the time again I felt guilty. It wasn't really my place to invite her in but it would feel wrong to send her off in a cab.\n\nI nod my head towards the door of the home \"You wanna come in? I doubt Trish would mind.\"\n\nFang hesitated for a moment, staring at the door with apprehension before she sighed \"Guess it's time then, I was sort of enjoying the night being just the two of us.\"\n\nSeems like Bill Withers hasn't left me, even five years later.\n\n\"I meant to sleep, fang. Trish drank a hell of a lot more than I did. We shouldn't wake her.\"\n\nPlus I still hadn't decided what to do with... Us? Were we an us? This is what I'm talking about.\n\nOnce she nodded her assent we both stood up from the porch step and stretched away the aches that had accumulated from such a poor seat. My spine popped audibly as I finally corrected my posture, good lord I hadn't sat that hunchbacked since I spent my days shitposting for hours on end. It's a good thing some kind posters made posture checks or I might have done permanent damage. Fang looked like she was enjoying her stretch as well, She even splayed her wings out to their full length. The sight left my heart sinking, I had caught bits and pieces of their condition before but now I could plainly see just how bad they were. It wasn't just that she was missing feathers, she was missing damn near half her wings. I could vividly remember being wrapped in them like a blanket but now? What few feathers she had remaining hung limply from the skin and close to the bone, she could cover my shoulders at best. Fang caught me staring but neither of us said a word, as desperate as I was to talk to her, I knew it was too much for one night.\n\nInstead, I carefully opened the door for her, I even held my tongue regarding any ladies' first remarks. Fang seemed to read my mind regardless and rolled her eyes but still went in without complaint, following after her I saw something in the last glimmer of moonlight before she was consumed by the shadows of the home. Her tail, poking out of her jeans, had the barest hint of black marking near the base. Surely that wasn't a tattoo? But what else could it be? I shook my head and gingerly closed the door behind me, that was a mystery that would haunt me for a while. Fang paused in the living room, she crossed her arms and whistled.\n\n\"Huh, guess you weren't kidding\" despite her hushed tone she sounded impressed.\n\nStepping next to her I could see she was looking at the pile of empty beer cans left scattered on and around the table. God damn, you never really knew just how much beer was in a case until it was empty.\n\n\"Would you believe Trish downed most of that?\" I whispered to her, people were sleeping after all.\n\n\"She get too drunk to leave you a blanket? Harsh.\" Fang whispered back, looking towards the sole couch in the room.\n\n\"What?\" I asked before the realization hit me, I was totally sleeping on the couch and not in Trish's bed. Yep. Definitely.\n\n\"Uh, yeah, you can have the couch\" I offered, hoping I didn't sound nervous as I slid into the same armchair I was in earlier.\n\nFang promptly slumped onto the couch belly first, guess that made sense with the wings and all. She grabbed a couch cushion and crossed her arms beneath it, I'd be damned if she didn't look comfortable. Wish I could say the same, sadly this wasn't one of those fancy chairs where you could pull a lever and gain a footrest. I had slept in some pretty shitty conditions back in the navy but I wasn't about to repeat them as a civvie. Gingerly moving cans from the desk to the floor to make space for my feet I could hear Fang snicker over the scraping of cans.\n\n\"Remember, no take-backs\" she mumbled from her makeshift pillow, sounding very pleased with herself.\n\nI didn't deign that with a response, I was already starting to regret being the gentleman. My back certainly wasn't going to be thanking me in the morning but I guess Fang would have had it worse. Propping my feet up on the newly cleared space I gave one last stretch for the night. With a pleased sigh, I leaned into the plush seat and finally gave in to the demands of my sore, tired eyes.\n\n\"Hey, what's that?\"\n\nI barely managed to force my eyes open, Fang was pointing towards the smoke machine that Reed brought. Unable to fight another yawn, I informed her as much.\n\nI could hear Fang 'hmm' thoughtfully but it was far too late to talk to her about it, what was so interesting about a smoke machine anyways? Thankfully, that seemed to be the only question she had. At long last, I could finally fall into the velvet embrace of slumber.\n\nMy dreams were an eclectic mess, swirls of vivid shades and sounds that kept me company in inky blackness. The colors joined the ethereal sensations to solidify into something tangible. A spray of ice water chilling me to the bone. A seductive cloud of choking smoke that promised I didn't need to breathe. A leash pulled taut around my neck as gray feathers fluttered down from an invisible sky. A ship held aloft by a sea of faceless figures with one twinkling star beckoning in the night sky. A clay bird adorned with a spider web of fractures resting in a shallow basin of liquid gold. A blinding white cage trapping me with a thickly-maned lion about to pounce. Eventually, I was left alone in the tenebrous realm of dreams with nothing to keep me focused. Little by little the consciousness I retained had begun to slip until the staccato bellow of a firearm pierced the darkness. Its terrifying note intensifying into a shrill scream until the unbearable sound had begun to rattle my skull.\n\nI shot out of my chair, taking great gasps of air. My heart was hammering in my chest and sweat had overtaken me in my sleep. That awful note I heard continued into the waking world but had distorted into something less menacing. I could see Tana in the kitchen, bending down and retrieving a dropped spoon. I relaxed as I realized that horrid sound was well and truly gone. She just woke me up from a nightmare that's all. As my heart gradually settled, the details of my dream faded away from me. I was surprised, usually, I didn't dream at all, for good reason it seems. Faint rays of sunlight were filtering through the pulled blinds signaling that it was morning. The ache in the back of my eyes seemed to say otherwise, well if Trish wasn't awake then I didn't have to be either. I leaned back in my seat, reveling in the fact that I didn't have to get up for school as soon as the sun rose unlike certain people in the house.\n\nOnce I closed my eyes, however, my stomach grumbled. I stubbornly stayed where I was, it wouldn't be the first time I ate a sleep sandwich. Yet I couldn't relax between the clink of Tana's spoon against a bowl and my stomach doing its best attempt to eat itself. Ugh, Did Rosa and Stella have to eat everything last night? With a groan I stood and headed towards the kitchen, Tana barely paid me any mind. Looking at the disheveled girl I doubt I looked much better, she had thrown on the baggiest clothes she could and pulled her hair to the side rather than style it. Tana stared blankly at her phone as she slowly chewed what was likely the only sugary thing in the household. Opening a few cabinets proved my suspicion true, I liked whey and oatmeal as much as the next guy but sometimes you just crave something with, uh, taste.\n\n\"You mind if I have a bowl of that?\" I asked tentatively.\n\nTana grunted in reply, good enough for me then. With a bowl and spoon in hand, I set up my own breakfast of deliciously unhealthy cereal. While the first bite was heaven in my mouth I felt a little guilty to break my meal plan. Worse, the thought made me embarrassed, A grown man really shouldn't worry so much about eating cereal. I soothed the pain with another bite of Chieftan Crunch, The colorful box art exclaimed 'crunchatize me, Grug!' How the hell did something like this even get sold in this day and age? Rather than dwell on that I looked across to Tana. I should say something to her, Trish and I are on good terms. Might as well make the attempt to be on good terms with her family too.\n\n\"How's school going?\"\n\nThe glare she gave me was absolutely withering, I guess I deserved it for doing the most boring adult thing ever.\n\nI held up my hands in surrender \"alright, fine. You got me, that was a dumb question.\"\n\nThat at least made her smile but rather than reply she grabbed another spoonful of delicious racism and returned to her phone.\n\n\"So you knew Fang?\" I tried again.\n\n\"Mhm\" was her non-committal response, a good start.\n\nI tapped the table as I thought about how to get her to open up. Her hoodie was unzipped exposing an interesting shirt underneath, the simple black shirt had some rather distinctive letters across the chest. I swear I had seen them before but it was hard to tell what it said beneath the jacket. The realization struck me like lightning, that was a VVURM DRAMA shirt! No wonder it was so baggy, that must have been Trish's shirt from high school!\n\n\"So, What was your favorite song? I'm partial to Ballad Of The Boot myself.\"\n\nTana paused mid-bite, putting the spoon down. The tiny triceratops looked at me with new eyes, Maybe even a hint of respect?\n\n\"The Hitler song with the really long name was their best work\" Tana said with certainty, clearly she had thought about this before.\n\nIt took me a moment to put the memories together, the Hitler song? God damn it Reed, who let that man name anything?\n\n\"A lady of excellent taste, what else do you listen to?\" I smiled as Tana started listing off bands. Hook, line, and sinker.\n\nFor once, Tana and I had a pleasant conversation. Truth be told I was lucky to know what genre she was even talking about let alone any particular band or song. Thankfully, I was Anon Y. Mous the bullshitter extraordinaire, and managed to navigate the conversation without embarrassing myself. I found it a bit funny, I was never a very musical person yet so many of the people in my life were. While I nodded along to Tana explaining exactly why some bands latest album lacked soul I resolved to change that. Maybe I'll try listening to some of the stuff she was talking about? I definitely needed to practice my singing on more than just Sunday too. When Tana checked her phone again she cursed and snatched up the backpack left leaning against the table. It was then that I realized I was missing an opportunity.\n\n\"Before you go, do you know why Fang and Trish stopped talking?\" I called out as she was halfway to the door.\n\nTana paused, glancing at the sleeping ptero before she turned back to me\n\n\"Not really\" She shook her head for emphasis \"see ya later, Mr. Mous.\"\n\nI wasn't so sure if I believed her but the idea that I had become a 'Mr. Mous' was too distracting. At least Tana couldn't see me die on the inside when she turned and left for school.\n\nThat sobering thought sat with me as finished the rest of the sugary cereal, had to devour the evidence after all. With my conversation partner gone to school and Fang still fast asleep on the couch, I turned to the time-honored tradition of phone posting. Still had a few hours until Trish and I absolutely had to be somewhere but she'd certainly want to talk with Fang. Not to mention the most obvious thing, Trish was a woman, which meant she took absolutely ages to get ready for anything. I didn't actually know that for certain but stereotypes existed for a reason, right? Deciding to err on the side of caution I set a pot of coffee for the three of us. Giving it a bit more thought I poured a glass of water as well, Trish was definitely going to need it when she woke up. Frankly, it was a small miracle I managed to get through the morning without a hangover myself.\n\nI considered sneaking down the hall but it's not like Tana and I were trying to be all that quiet, Fang slept like a rock it seems. Water in hand I pushed open the door to Trish's room and was immediately caught off guard. I was too drunk and, uh, preoccupied to notice last night but it was jarring just how personalized her room was compared to the rest of the house. She had a trophy on a small table next to the bed and even some medals hanging off the bedpost. A pair of heavy dumbells lay next to a standing mirror and stereo, an old XL VVURM DRAMA shirt was pinned to the wall above the dresser, just below it were framed photos. The most obvious thing of all was the smell, the air itself was scented heavily with Trish. Stepping into her room It was hard not to feel like an invader of some kind, that I didn't belong here. Walking around to her side of the bed I paused when those pictures became clear. There was one where she had a gloved hand held up by a referee but by and large, most of these were memories from her childhood. I could feel the frown on my face when I saw just how many of them featured Fang, both as a child and as the teenage girl I fell in love with.\n\nTrish really never stopped being her friend, what on earth could have caused them to break apart as they did? One photo, in particular, caught my eye, picking it up left me drowning in melancholy. It was VVURM DRAMA's big break at Dino-Moe's, Based on the angle of the picture it looked like Moe himself took this. Their performance was amazing until I went and ruined it by fucking with the cables, ending the show before their finale. I put the frame back on the dresser before I was well and truly lost in my memories. Turning my back on the relics of the past I walked towards sleeping beauty herself. Trish had unconsciously taken full advantage of my absence, she had splayed herself fully across the bed. Her hair was a haphazard mess, her pillow was damp with drool and the silence of the room was broken by intermittent snoring. Alright, maybe beauty wasn't a very apt description but I wasn't going to hold it against her after last night. I almost didn't want to wake her, but I knew she'd be upset if I didn't. Reaching out and grasping her shoulder I shook it gently to no avail, Giving a firmer second shake achieved similar results. Only one thing left to do before drastic measures then.\n\n\"Hey, c'mon sleepy head. Time to get up.\" I whispered into her ear\n\nFinally, those lavender lashes of hers fluttered open, at least for a brief moment before she screwed them tight again. Trish let out a long, pained groan as she tightened into a ball, tail curling around herself protectively.\n\n\"Anon... I'm going to die...\" she mumbled beneath her pillow.\n\nI did my absolute best not to laugh at her but still couldn't resist chuckling.\n\n\"You're not going to die Trish\" I patted her shoulder reassuringly \"here, I got you some water.\"\n\nDespite my offering, Trish remained stubbornly curled beneath the covers.\n\n\"It'll make you feel better\" I coaxed her, shaking the liquid audibly within its glass.\n\nThat seemed to do it, Trish reluctantly shed the warmth of her blanket and took the drink from me. I winced when I saw her dress, it was clearly a tight fit, and the... Rigors... Of last night proved too much for it. The expensive fabric was stretched and torn irreparably in several places. Not that Trish seemed to mind, she was far too busy draining the glass like it was the last thing she'd ever drink. When the last drop was gone she deposited the empty glass on the table and promptly fell back into the bed, eyes closed.\n\n\"Best. Assistant. Ever.\" she mumbled, barely audible.\n\nI rolled my eyes, I'm pretty sure treating my boss's hangover wasn't in the job description. No better time than now to broach the subject of Fang, had to do it before Trish fell back asleep. Deep breaths, Anon.\n\n\"Listen, Trish. I've got a bit of a surprise for you\"\n\nShe didn't open her eyes but a smile pulled at her lips, coyly replying with a simple \"hmm?\"\n\n\"Fang's here.\"\n\n\"WHAT!?\" She shouted, shooting halfway out of bed.\n\nA hand quickly went to her head, face scrunched up in pain. The hangover punishing her for the noise.\n\nI let her recover before whispering \"I bumped into her a while ago, she's... Not in a great place but we've been talking.\"\n\n\"But- You-\" Trish struggled to find the words before a determination took over \"I'm talking with her.\"\n\nShe swung her legs over the edge of the bed but I held out a hand to stop her\n\n\"She's asleep, Trish.\" I gestured towards her bathroom \"Why don't you get cleaned up, I'll get breakfast ready.\"\n\nTrish looked like she wanted to argue, in fact, I knew she was going to. If she got a word in I'd never convince her otherwise.\n\n\"Don't forget we've got work today, she'll still be there when you're done.\"\n\nA few seconds passed before Trish eventually sighed \"you're right.\"\n\nI stood back to let her up, which she managed to do after only a little stumbling. Once she found her footing, Trish grabbed my collar and yanked me down to her eye level to place a quick peck on my lips.\n\n\"So responsible\" she whispered fondly.\n\nI didn't get a chance to respond as she let me go right after and sashayed over to the bathroom, tail swaying back and forth languidly. For the best honestly, I doubt I would have been able to respond to that without putting my foot in my mouth. I headed to the kitchen once I heard her start the shower, torn between elation and doubt. Why couldn't I just have straightforward feelings for once? Thankfully, I had another excuse not to focus on actually resolving them. Raiding through Trish's pantry I couldn't find much suitable for breakfast, guess bacon and eggs didn't work great for an herbivore. Thankfully however I found that classic box that no household was complete without, pancakes! With that decided I set about preparing the table, humming a tune as I worked. Having finished the first batch I turned back to the kitchen table to set the plate down only to find Fang sitting there. She was nursing a cup of coffee that I placed earlier, how the hell did she manage to do that without me noticing?\n\nThe tired ptero smiled knowingly as if she knew exactly what I was thinking.\n\n\"If you tell me how you did that, I'll give you these pancakes.\"\n\nFang didn't even look up from her coffee \"You'll give them to me anyways\"\n\nDamn, she was right. What was this Jedi mind trick? Fang smiled smugly when I placed the syrupy plate in front of her until she noticed something\n\n\"Where's my fork?\"\n\n\"You never asked for one\" I shrugged, smiling as I returned to the stove\n\nI expected her to argue, at least complain a little, but there was silence. Unable to control myself I had to look back, Fang sat there with a rolled-up pancake in her hand looking straight at me. As soon as she had my attention she opened that cavernous snout of hers and devoured the entire pastry with a single snap of her jaws. Fang, what the hell?\n\n\"Fang, what the hell?\" I echoed my thoughts.\n\nShe looked impossibly self-satisfied as she chewed. Alright, fine, that was pretty funny.\n\n\"I'm not interrupting anything am I?\" A tentative voice called our attention.\n\nBoth Fang and I turned to see Trish standing uncomfortably at the entrance to the kitchen, her hair still damp from the shower. I half expected her to dress up for meeting Fang again but her choice of attire was a simple tracksuit that I'd seen her in plenty of times. She didn't even bother zipping up the jacket, a black crop top lying beneath it preserving her modesty.\n\n\"Oh! You forgot this in my room, Anon\" Trish decided to push past the awkwardness by making her way to me instead, I could see my discarded and forgotten vest folded over her arm.\n\nI couldn't help it, I looked at Fang. She glanced between Trish and myself, clearly putting everything together. Trish all but spelled it out after all. Trish handed over the vest with a nervous smile, looking at me for comfort while she steeled her nerves.\n\n\"Hi Fang\" Trish said at last, turning to greet her\n\n\"Hi Trish\" Fang replied, her tone as perfectly neutral as her face.\n\n\"So!\" I cleared my throat \"How about breakfast then?\"\n\nTrish sat down and shot me another smile, I was unsure whether it was for helping break the ice or for the food.\n\nSitting down myself I feel like I didn't do much for the atmosphere. It was still thick with tension and expectation, Trish seemed unsure what to say while Fang didn't look eager to speak at all. Guess it's up to me then.\n\n\"What kept you from showing up last night, Fang? We missed you.\"\n\n\"Sleep.\"\n\nIt was startling how curt she had become, the playful Fang from just a few minutes earlier completely gone. I was about to ask why she was asleep in the middle of the day, well into the night even, but Trish actually spoke up instead\n\n\"You were coming to Anon's party?\" She sounded genuinely surprised.\n\n\"Mhm\" Fang didn't meet her gaze \" Anon thought we should talk.\"\n\nTrish gave me a wide smile, this must-have meant a lot to her. Trish's expression held more than just gratitude though, was that pride?\n\n\"The party may have been for me but it was all Trish's idea, she was the one who called Reed!\" I added cheerily, probably best to talk up Trish here.\n\n\"You found Rosa and Stella though!\" Trish turned to Fang before adding \"At church, if you can believe it, I know I almost didn't.\"\n\nFang grunted in response, still far too interested in her rapidly emptying coffee cup to look at either of us.\n\nHeart? Brain? Any ideas here? No? Time to go with gut then.\n\n\"Alright, what the hell is the deal here!?\" I ask in disbelief\n\n\"You two used to be best friends!\" I slap the table to get their attention, the sound even makes Fang look up. \"Why are you acting like this!?\"\n\nRather than give either of them time to answer me, I look straight at Fang.\n\n\"If you can forgive me, why can't you can forgive her too?\"\n\nA few heartbeats pass by in silence, then a few more. I can feel Trish's stare on me but right now my eyes are locked with Fang's. It's a contest of wills that I refuse to lose. I can tell that Fang is searching my eyes for something, despite saying no words I understood perfectly what she's asking me. Why, why am I doing this? Fang finally tore her gaze from me, instead fixating it on Trish\n\n\"Why don't you tell me everything that happened last night, Trish?\" She asked far too casually for the conversation at hand\n\n\"What?\" Both Trish and I echoed each other.\n\n\"I'll answer as soon as you're done. Don't leave out any details\" She glanced at me briefly \"If she does, correct her.\"\n\nWhat the hell was this about? Trish glanced between us nervously, I'm not sure why when she basically already told Fang about the most intimate part of the night. Fang was waiting expectantly however, At this point, even I was curious where this was going.\n\nSeeing little opportunity for anything else, Trish started recounting the night. It started with her faking an illness to have the day for preparations and calling Reed over to help set things up. Then, of course, the party actually started with Rosa, Stella and I arriving. Trish mentioned introducing me to Tana but I added that Trish never told me about her before yesterday. Fang's expression darkened at that but held her tongue. Trish continued on to the party games that Reed started, she didn't actually specify the game so I gave examples. When I brought up Reed's last question Fang's eyes narrowed but again she chose not to comment. Finally, Trish got to our little prom night, I interjected again that Reed took Stella home once the slow dance started. That left only the end of the night, Trish and I shared a look, the dual blush on our cheeks was a good enough indication of what happened after that.\n\nFang was glaring daggers by the time the story was finished, not at me surprisingly, but Trish. When she looked my way her eyes actually softened, it almost looked like sympathy.\n\n\"Why don't I tell you what actually happened\" She said turning a steely gaze towards Trish \"Trish planned every moment of that night.\"\n\n\"She brought Reed so she could use him to subtly direct the conversation, The game he chose wasn't spur of the moment, the questions brought up were carefully chosen.\" Fang growled, her voice building intensity\n\n\"Why do you think he even had that fog machine? He didn't use it when everyone was actually dancing! It was all for Trish and her perfect fucking plan\" she practically spat the words.\n\n\"Here's the best part, Trish KNOWS this is wrong. That's why she was drinking so much, she needed to build her confidence.\" Fang had gripped the side of the table now, her talons digging into the wood \"Or better yet, she just wanted an EXCUSE for herself. She didn't manipulate anyone, she was too drunk to do that!\"\n\n\"Tell me, Anon. When was the last time in the past MONTH you did something that Trish didn't want you to do? Don't actually answer that, I already know.\"\n\nFang stood from her chair, looming over an utterly stunned Trish.\n\n\"You want to know what happened? Why we're not friends? It's THIS shit. She just can't let people be THEMSELVES! She did it to me for YEARS before you and she tried doing it AGAIN once we broke up! At least by then, I was actually smart enough to catch her BULLSHIT.\"\n\n\"So no, I DONT forgive her! Because she was a manipulative, controlling psycho five years ago and she's STILL. FUCKING. DOING. IT!\" Fang screamed hoarsely at Trish, tattered wings flaring behind her.\n\nI was no less stunned than Trish, that was... Wow. My mind desperately dug for something I could use to refute her, this wasn't how I wanted it to go. I came up empty, there was no denying the past month had absolutely been consumed by Trish. My personal and professional life could be summed up by doing whatever Trish said. Even the little things, when and where to stop for food? Trish. What we were doing on our days off? Trish. Hell, the one day I actually did something completely independent of her was entirely because Trish wanted me to.\n\n\"I'm leaving. Thanks for trying, Anon.\" Fang rasped bitterly, her voice raw.\n\nTrish And I sat in silence, now alone. It wasn't a surprise that her cheeks were damp with tears still freely flowing. What do I even say? How do I even talk to Trish now without worrying about some kind of ulterior motive? Was it like this since the first day we met again? Was she grooming me like some kind of fucking project? Polishing a trophy she wanted since high school?\n\n\"I think I'm going to go too.\"\n\n\"Anon...\" Trish sobbed audibly for the first time.\n\n\"I just need to think about some stuff, okay? Maybe take a few days off work.\" I stood stiffly \"I'll send you the schedules.\"\n\n\"Please...\"\n\nPlease don't believe her, please comfort me, please don't go.\n\nI walked towards the door, forcing one foot in front of the other. My hand paused on the doorknob, I wasn't strong enough to leave without looking back. Even from here, I could see Trish still sat in the kitchen. Her expression was unreadable with her face buried in her arms, the shaking of her shoulders told me enough. I stepped through the door to find Fang still standing on the porch, mascara running down her cheeks. Closing the door to Trish's home with a quiet click felt darkly familiar.\n\nIt felt like I was closing the door of the principal's office on her for the second time."},"Siblings Stick Together.txt":{"path":["Multiple","Siblings Stick Together.txt"],"text":"Title: Siblings Stick Together\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Naser and Naomi\nRating: Semi-NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: SurpriseVisitor\nSummary: On the heels of a disastrous prom night spent on the beach, Fang struggles to cope with what Anon said to her. Can the brother she's despised and scorned for years possibly help?\n\n\nPluck. Another white feather falls from my beak, drifting onto the floor of my dim, moonlit room. The feather itself hasn\u2019t changed; it is still a feather, but no longer is it part of a whole. It littered the floor with a dozen others, purposeless. Nothing more than refuse, destined to rot in a landfill. \nPluck. I seethe as a streak of scarlet flows down my wing, the metallic taste of blood in my mouth. A wave of adrenaline masks the pain, both inside and outside, for a moment. Another feather falls to the floor, joining the others. I sit on the edge of my bed, sheets marred with splotches of crimson, wing stretched in front of me, focusing on anything I can. Anything except tonight.\nMy claws dig into the side of my arm, breaking the skin. Blood smears my fingers, the pain at the forefront of my mind. I shudder as the pain dulls and another pain returns. I promised I would stop doing this. \nYank. That one hurt. Tears wet my face again, the pain clouding my mind like morphine. Focus on the pain, or it\u2019ll hurt more. I take a deep breath, the scent of blood filling my nose. Hold onto it, or you\u2019ll lose it.\nI open my mouth and reach for another feather to yank. I stop short as another wave of grief begs to be vocalized. Tears squeeze themselves out my eyes, threatening another deluge. A scream claws its way up my throat. My hands pull at my scalp, a desperate attempt to keep my thoughts inside. The breath I was holding leaves my lungs as a shaky moan, the final seal broken. I gasp, a thousand dark thoughts taunting me from the edges of my perception.  Helpless to the violent whims of my emotions, I cave.\nI wail a terrible note of pain and loss; one solitary chord of a much longer song, for one single night of a much longer life. Tears flow anew and I bury myself in my abused wing, tearing at my hair. It had taken months for Anon to pull me out of my shell, to wrench me away from my friends, to learn my innermost secrets and insecurities. My guard was down, I trusted him, and in a single drunken rant spanning a few scant minutes he had torn me to pieces and scattered them to the ocean, lost to the tide forever. \n\nA doorknob turns, sickly amber light creeping across the floor up to my shoes. I should\u2019ve locked the door.\n\u201cFang?\u201d Naser calls, worried as he always is. I fail to respond, my words replaced with a sob that wracks my body. \u201cOh my God, Fang!\u201d Footsteps rush over and a shadow blocks the light from the hallway. \u201cAre-are you okay? What happened, do you need first aid, or-or a doctor, or-\u201d His words meld together into a symphony of panic, voice cracking and sentences falling apart as he desperately tries to grasp the situation.\n\u201cNaser...\u201d I moan quietly through my wing, unable to muster anything more. \u201cPlease...stop...\u201d He stops, but I don\u2019t have the energy to thank him, continuing to stain my wing with blood and tears instead. All that remains in the room is my crying and labored breathing. Footsteps click away, and the door closes. Solitude, once again...\nFootsteps click back towards me, and a weight depresses a spot on the bed next to me. Why is he still here? \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he whispers. Fuck off. Go away. Get out of my business. Phrases I had pelted at him so often they were almost instinctual, and yet not one made itself heard. \n\u201cAnon happened,\u201d I whisper back, the last thing I had expected to say to Naser of all people. He stays surprisingly quiet, and more words spill forth from me like my tears had been. \n\u201cGot drunk. Yelled at me. Called me a faggot.\u201d My tone deadens, tears still falling.\n\u201cMentally Ill. Attention whore.\u201d Anger creeps in, a tear struggling to escape my eye.\n\u201cTold me I\u2019m broken. Can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d I clench my fists, claws digging into my palms. \n\u201cFucking bastards. Mom, dad, Naomi, Anon...fuck all of them!\u201d For a moment, I forget Naser is sitting next to me. The next moment, I realize I don\u2019t care. The anger brings me clarity, and I briefly wonder what it would be like to sink these claws into Anon\u2019s throat.\n\u201cUh, what does...Naomi...have to do with this?\u201d I lower my wing just enough to see past it, and look over at Naser. Even in the moonlight, I can see the shocked expression on his face. Of course the fucking idiot doesn\u2019t know, why would he? I hide behind my wing again. \n\u201cPushed Anon to me. Her idea from the fucking beginning. Part of her plan to \u2018fix\u2019 me.\u201d The word alone brings me to the edge of rage. \u201cNone of this would\u2019ve happened if she had just kept her fucking snout out of my business!\u201d My wing leaves me, revealing my wet, makeup-smeared face now blistering with barely-restrained hatred.\n\u201cWhy does everyone want to \u2018fix\u2019 me so fucking badly?\u201d My wings flare violently, every self-inflicted wound reminding me of their existences in unison as I say that word again. I grimace from the pain, my fury hitting its peak. \n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anybody FUCKING CARE ABOUT ME?\u201d The meteoric outburst leaves an empty crater in me, despair and anguish flooding in from all sides to fill the void. I collapse, hunching over and burying my face in my hands as my tears return. All sorts of terrible thoughts plague my mind as I weep, my burning throat and wing in agony only a miniscule portion of my pain. \nLoser. Nuisance. Unwanted. Broken.\n\nI feel the gentlest touch of a hand against my shoulder. Naser. Baby brother Naser...\n\u201cExcept you\u2026\u201d I sob. \u201cYou\u2019re...always there. No matter how many names I call you or what terrible things I say to you, you\u2019re always there...why?\u201d He doesn\u2019t respond.\nAfter some time, I dare to raise my head again. Naser\u2019s looking at the ground, conflicted. He notices me watching him, and sits back up. He clicks his tongue a couple times, then reaches into his pocket, pulling out his phone and pressing the screen a few times. A generic dial tone sounds once, twice, thrice\u2026\n\u201cHey sweetie! What\u2019s up?\u201d Naomi\u2019s high-pitched, overexcited voice is like nails on a chalkboard, and instantly puts me on edge. What the fuck is he doing?\n\u201cHey babe, uh...weird question, but did you...have anything to do with...Fang and Anon?\u201d He\u2019s being particularly careful with his words. She giggles obnoxiously. \n\u201cI should\u2019ve known someone as smart as you would\u2019ve figured it out eventually!\u201d Disgusting.\n\u201cYeah, but, uh...what did you do?\u201d \n\u201cOh! Well, I noticed that Fang was stressing you out so much last semester, and I wanted to help, but she-...they wouldn\u2019t ever really talk to you or I. I heard that a new student was transferring, so I...well, pulled some strings. Got them into a couple of classes together, put in a bit of effort, and look at them now! Don\u2019t they make a lovely couple?\u201d \n\u201cI, um\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCome on Naser, stop worrying. I bet they\u2019re having a wonderful night together. Anon is everything Fang needs to fi-ahem...help them. Is...someone else there?\u201d I was so focused on the traitorous bitch\u2019s explanation that I didn\u2019t realize I had leaned over and was angrily breathing into Naser\u2019s phone. I clamp my snout shut, turning away but still listening intently. \n\u201cUh, no, it was just the TV. Let me...turn that down.\u201d I can\u2019t control my breathing. Anon drunkenly spilling the beans was one thing, but to hear her so succinctly lay everything on the table like that reignites my hatred. \u201cBut, um...do you really think they need...fixing?\u201d\n\u201cI...well\u2026\u201d A hint of nervousness creeps into her otherwise cheery voice. \u201cYou know what I mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNaomi\u2026\u201d Naser is actually pushing back against her? She sighs.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever say it to their face, of course, but...look, don\u2019t worry about it. Fang and Anon are practically made for each other.\u201d I know exactly what that fucking cunt means by that. \n\u201cYeah, I guess...I\u2019ve uh, gotta go. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d\n\u201cOkay sweetie, bye-bye!\u201d The call ends with a click. Naser lowers his phone onto the bed, but doesn\u2019t move his gaze from where it was.\n\u201cShe has no idea\u2026\u201d he mutters.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t care,\u201d I snarl, rage threatening to consume me again. \u201cShe never did. Only wanted me out of the fucking picture.\u201d I struggle to keep myself from screaming. I was right about her all along. Naser looks distraught and aimless, like that conversation casted doubt onto everything he knew. \n\u201cThis...this isn\u2019t right\u2026\u201d he mumbles. He slowly hunches over, placing his face in his hands. \u201cThis is all my fault\u2026\u201d My white-hot rage flash freezes in an instant.\n\u201cNaser, no. She tricked you. She tricked everyone. This is all because of her.\u201d \n\u201cDid she really do all this...just for my attention?\u201d I lightly nod. \u201cDoes she even care about me then? Or just my attention? I trusted her...\u201d He trails off, and a painful silence cloaks us. The darkness I sought when I arrived earlier suddenly feels oppressive and uncomfortable. \n\u201cNaser...are we broken?\u201d He doesn\u2019t reply, but I know what he\u2019s thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s just us, isn\u2019t it? Nobody else can understand us. They won\u2019t.\u201d \nNaser\u2019s head finally turns, his eyes meeting mine. Anguish. Betrayal. Heartbreak. Just like me. Two lost souls cast into the howling dark at the whim of someone who couldn\u2019t care less. For the first time in almost a decade, I feel like we truly understand each other. Like all the arbitrary limits that separate us no longer matter. \n\nThe few inches between our snouts disappear as I press my lips to his. For a moment, it almost feels like I haven\u2019t lost anything at all. In fact, this is the best I\u2019ve felt all night, if only for a few seconds\u2026\nI open my eyes as I pull away, looking into Naser\u2019s eyes. \nOh God.  \nAll at once every feather on my body stands up, every wound feeling like it\u2019s being torn open again. I whip my head back towards the floor, hands clenching my knees. Terror grips my heart. No word dares bear the responsibility of being spoken first. The world stands still, and I swear I can hear the swell of the ocean\u2019s waves again. \nI feel the gentlest touch of a hand against my shoulder. I don\u2019t move a muscle. The weight on the bed shifts ever so slightly closer. My eyes dare to glance sideways. Naser smiles warmly, a reassurance I\u2019m not sure I want. I raise myself back up, never breaking eye contact. \nOur lips meet again. All my fears and apprehensions recede like the tide. We pull away and look into each other\u2019s eyes again, and this time I only feel relief. Someone that cares. Someone that\u2019s always cared. Someone that I was looking for for so long, and he was right in front of me this entire time. I lean into him, laying my head on his shoulder. The hand on my shoulder reaches to my back, pulling me closer. I reflexively stretch a wing to place around him.\n\u201cAh, fuck!\u201d I seethe, pulling the wing back. \n\u201cShould I...get some first aid or something?\u201d \n\u201cOkay, but...don\u2019t let them see you.\u201d He nods, takes his shoes off, then quietly steps out into the hallway, closing the door behind him. Barely a minute later he returns, a red bag with a white cross on it in hand.\n\nOver an hour of awful chemical smells and sharp pains pass before Naser is satisfied with his work. Parts of my wing are covered in gauze, some already stained red, my hands and arms have a number of bandages on them, and my face is no longer smeared with makeup, blood and tears. Exhausted, I collapse into him, wrapping my arms around him and burying my head in his chest. \n\u201cI love you, Naser.\u201d Words I\u2019ve needed to say for so long, but with never the right person to say them to.\n\u201cI love you too, Fang.\u201d Words I\u2019ve needed to hear for so long, but with never the right person to hear them from. He runs his fingers through my frayed, unkempt hair. My eyelids fall shut, the grace of sleep ready to take me into a new chapter of my life. Naser shifts, trying to release himself from my embrace.\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d \n\u201cFang, I need to sleep too.\u201d\n\u201cSleep here.\u201d Mercifully, he relents. We lie in each other's embrace, drifting off to sleep. I know our love will be challenged and scorned, but we will face it together.","Title":"Siblings Stick Together","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Naser and Naomi","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"SurpriseVisitor","Summary":"On the heels of a disastrous prom night spent on the beach, Fang struggles to cope with what Anon said to her.

His clothes were rumbled, hastily grabbed from an unpacked box; a box that contained nothing of Lucy\u2019s. None of them had, their contents flung out in a desperate search for something, anything, that proved Lucy had moved into that apartment with Anon. Even her side of the bed was cold, the sheets undisturbed. Pulling his coat tighter against the fall air, Anon shivered involuntarily, a shiver that had nothing to do with the temperature.\nFrantically, Anon ran through the events as he knew them. Lucy hadn\u2019t been there when he woke up, no trace of her to be found in their apartment. Ripley didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, claimed to not have spoken to Lucy in years. Could this be some sort of elaborate prank, some means of getting back at him for hiding a jack-in-the-box in one of the boxes Lucy was packing the day before?\n\u201cNo, this is too cruel, even for her\u2026\u201d Anon shook his head, not noticing the stares that followed in the wake of his muttering. The apartment Lucy and he shared was in an older but still well-traveled part of town, a place where two young lovers could afford to start their lives together. A passing mother pulled her young daughter closer to her as Anon brushed past, unseeing, uncaring of anything or anyone that wasn\u2019t Lucy. Anon could feel himself spiraling out of control now, feel his world slipping away. He needed some advice, someone to set his mind straight, and he knew just where to find it. \nTish\u2019s apartment wasn\u2019t too far away from the small one-bedroom he and Lucy shared. Truth be told, it was Trish who had found the place for them, her and Rosa proving to be a huge help in getting their life started. Trish was Lucy\u2019s friend, her best friend. Lucy had probably just\u2026stopped by, on her way to get some breakfast, just like she said they would do. Grimacing, Anon remembered the plans he and Lucy had made as they laid in one another\u2019s arms last night, plans that seemed to be vanishing like midmorning fog.\nThe building that Trish lived in was an old brick building, on a block that was a historically Triceratops neighborhood. Anon had nearly cried when he read her name on the list of tenants, reaching out to it like a drowning man would reach for a life preserved. Thumbing the button, Anon waited: The buzzer for Trish\u2019s apartment pierced the stillness of the morning, the shrill bell echoing loudly in the small stoop that served as entrance to her building. \n\u201cCome on, pick up Trish\u2026\u201d Even Anon could hear the panic on his voice.\n\u201c\u2026Hello?\u201d The voice on the other line was groggy, dripping with annoyance. Trish was never a morning person.\nAnon pressed himself as close as he could to the small intercom, struggling to keep his voice steady. \u201cTrish, thank Raptor Jesus you\u2019re up! This is Anon, is Lucy with you, I can\u2019t find her anywhere!\u201d She had to know where Lucy was, she had to!\n\u201cWait, Anon? Like from high-school, that Anon?\u201d Hot malice radiated from Trish\u2019s voice, muffled only slightly by the dodgy intercom. \u201cThe Anon that broke Fang\u2019s fucking heart all those years back?! How fucking DARE you come asking about her now! You fucking skinny piece of SHIT, do you know what you did to her?! FUCK. YOU.\u201d \n\u201cTrish, wait, please! I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but if I did anything to Lucy, please I can fix it, just tell me where she is!\u201d\nAnon could almost picture Trish on the other side of the intercom, a familiar look of hatred and rage blossoming across her face. Thinking back to those high-school days, Trish had looked at Anon like that a lot.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking unbelievable, you know that Anon?! You waited this fucking long to try and apologize, like it MATTERS now?! And what\u2019s with this \u201cLucy\u201d shit, anyways?!\u201d Trish\u2019s disgust for that name is evident even through the tinny reception of the ancient intercom. \u201cFANG is happy now, playing HER music, and you can just go fuck off back to your cave, you little spear-chucking piece of SHIT!\u201d A loud thump punctuates Trish\u2019s final words, as if she had struck the intercom with her fist before ending the call. \nAnon could only stand there, staring blankly at Trish\u2019s name on the list. Nothing she said made any sense! She talked like Anon had hurt Lucy in the past, back in high-school, but Anon had no idea what she was talking about, they had loved each other in high-school. And what was that about, about \u201cFang\u201d, like it was her real name, or something? Lucy used to go by that, sure, but she hadn\u2019t used that name in years. The only thing that Trish had said that made any sense, was that Lucy was playing music; but what did she mean by \u201cher\u201d music? What was that trigga talking about?!\nMovement from across the street caught Anon\u2019s eye as he turned away from the intercom, two hulking Triceratops moving towards him, scowls on their face. Gulping, Anon chastised himself for not watching his mumbling, especially here. Turning his back on the two probably wasn\u2019t a good idea, but Anon had to get out of there, fast, and no one could sprint backwards. \n\n\u201cAt least I\u2019ve got a lead now,\u201d Anon said as he took off running, the two men calling out after him. "},"What If Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Multiple","What If Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Chapter 2\r\n\r\nRemembering what Trish had said about Lucy playing her music, Anon spent the rest of the morning scouring every slightly dodgy record store, every second-hand guitar seller; any place where the old Lucy would\u2019ve been drawn to. It was the early afternoon by the time Anon paused in a familiar park, his heart sinking. The park had changed in the five years since he was gone: The playground had gotten replaced, and a few semi-permanent vendors were lining the paths and walkways, attempting to secure some weekend sales. The morning mist had burned off, leaving in its wake a bright and crisp Fall day. Families were out taking walks through the park, letting their children play in the piles of fallen leaves ahead of them. Every sight of a happy couple made Anon cringe a little more; there had been no sign of Lucy in any of the stores he visited, and no one there had seen anyone matching her description. \r\nSighing, Anon sat back on one of the park benches, scrubbing his hands across his face. He had since stopped wishing to wake up, pleading that this was just a bad dream, that he would blink his eyes and find himself back in bed, Lucy snoring gently next to him. Running from this situation wasn\u2019t going to get him anywhere; if he was going to find Lucy, he couldn\u2019t stop looking for her here, wallowing in self-pity! With one final scrub to wipe away the initial building of tears, Anon got to his feet, already looking up more music stores on his phone. \r\nA loud gurgling from his stomach reminded him that he hadn\u2019t eaten anything all day. He had been to consumed in his search to stop for food, but now that he had given himself a momentary respite, his body was paying him back in spades. Scowling, Anon tracked his eyes across the park, looking for a food vendor, any vendor, where he could get a quick bite before setting off again. A somewhat run-down cart sat on the edge of the path a few feet away, a faded red and yellow umbrella tilted against the afternoon sun shielding the purveyor from Anon\u2019s view. That one would do nicely, Anon decided, speed-walking over to it. A quick bite to eat, something he could take while he walked, and then it was back to his search. \r\nStepping around the umbrella, Anon\u2019s mind went blank, all thoughts of food escaping his mind. Like some sort of memory given life, the cart\u2019s vendor was the same orange woman with the ridiculous hat whom he had talked to before heading to Lucy\u2019s house, all those years ago! Age hadn\u2019t done any favors to the woman or her cart; the painted sign on the side of the cart had faded, been re-painted, and then faded again, the cartoon hot-dog barely legible on the side. The woman herself bore a few more wrinkles, and her overly large chef\u2019s hat sported a few more stains on it than Anon remembered. Her eyes were as quick as ever though, flashing quickly in the sun as she weighed Anon up as a potentially customer.\r\n\u201cHi there! Looking for some grub? We\u2019ve got chili dogs today, and I don\u2019t mind saying that you could use one, son!\u201d The woman was already dipping a ladle into a tureen on the back of the cart, steam roiling as she opened the metal lid. \u201cYou must really be hungry, friend, that mouth\u2019s hanging open so far I could practically drive my cart through it!\u201d Anon forced his mouth closed, mind racing. It was tenuous at best, but any link to his past might be the secret to finding out where Lucy had gone. Plus, that chili did look good.\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll take one. Listen, you may not remember me, but I used to live here, a few years back. You helped me once, gave me some advice about a \u2013\u201c\r\n\u201cAbout a girl, right? Yeah, we don\u2019t get a lot of humans here, outside of Skin Row, so I remember you. You were dating that Ptero girl, right?\u201d The vendor continued prepping the chili dog, smiling at Anon\u2019s curt nod. \u201cShame about what happened between the two of you. It\u2019s a small town, and word spreads pretty quickly, especially when you\u2019re friends with Moe.\u201d The vendor paused, ladle hovering over the surface of a glistening hot-dog. \u201cMoe didn\u2019t catch up with you, did he? He was pretty mad about what happened, what\u2026what you said to her.\u201d\r\nAnon grit his teeth, the vendor\u2019s question stabbing into his heart like a knife. \u201cA-actually, we, uh, worked things out. Have you seen her lately? We were supposed to meet up, but she hasn\u2019t answered her phone.\u201d He knew the lied was weak, and moved to disguise it, holding up his phone in an attempt to defend his tale. The vendor\u2019s eyes narrowed as she spooned the chili along the length of the hot-dog.\r\n\u201cBoy, I\u2019ve seen better lies from drunks so plastered they couldn\u2019t tell I was serving \u2018em the mustard bottle. What\u2019s really going on?\u201d The orange woman leaned her palms on the cart, and despite her diminutive frame seemed to loom over Anon, her eyes narrowing. \r\nAnon knew it was no use continuing to lie, but the thought of telling the truth, that his life with Lucy had just\u2026 vanished, sent chills down his spine. \u201cLook, have you seen her lately? I really need to find out where she went. It\u2019s important\u2026\u201d Anon could feel the tears welling up once more. \r\nThe vendor studied his face for a moment, eyes scanning his face for any semblance of falsehood. Something passed across her face, some sort of\u2026understanding of the situation. Sighing, the woman stood back, wrapping the chili dog up before handing it over. \r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where she is now, but I\u2019ve seen her at DeVito\u2019s, the pub down past Skin Row? Saw her there a few nights ago, when I was trying to work the night crowd.\u201d The vendor\u2019s hand shot out, snagging Anon\u2019s jacket as he spun to leave. \u201cHey, listen! That neighborhood is real bad, kid, so be careful. You could get hurt there \u2013 hey! What about my money?!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnon couldn\u2019t care about the minor theft he had just committed. He had found where Lucy could be, and he didn\u2019t dare waste another second without her.\r\n"},"What If Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Multiple","What If Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"Chapter 3\r\n\r\nPast Skin Row: That is what the vendor had said. Anon walked quickly through his old neighborhood, quietly wishing that he still had his old knife to protect himself, especially now that it was getting late. Those two seemed perfect for each other, knife and neighborhood. That little blade had felt out-of-place anywhere else he carried it, back then, and Skin Row had been unwelcoming to anyone who dared cross through it without one. As Anon stepped by another homeless human, closing his nose to the man\u2019s filthy stench, his hands flinched in his pockets, instinctively wrapping around his keys, ready to use anything to protect himself.\r\nSkin Row itself had gotten worse over the years, if that was at all possible. Even more windows were boarded up, even more trash had accumulated in the street. Fragments of memory bubbled at the familiar sights, and Anon found himself passing his old apartment building, the brick fa\u00e7ade crumbling from age and mistreatment. It looked like it still was in use, given the lights on in the windows. Tracking his head up, Anon could see the small window that used to be his own, the only dark window on that row. Did anyone live there, anymore, wallowing in loneliness as he did so long ago?  Hearing Trish talk about high-school had stirred up some painful memories for Anon, memories of his life before he met Lucy. Anon was so sure he was going to coast through life back in those days, unaware and unbothered by anyone else. It was Lucy who had helped pull him out of that hole, helped him experience life as it should be lived. And now she was gone, disappearing out of his life like a ghost.\r\nThe crazed ramblings of a drug-addict snapped Anon out of his reverie. Skin Row was no place to take a walk down memory lane, and he still had a ways to walk before he got to the right part of town. In the past, Anon rarely visited that part of town, the neighborhood that sat on the opposite side of Skin Row as Little \u2018Troon, but he vaguely recalled that it was even worse than Skin Row, a ghetto where the poor dinosaurs and humans intermingled. Racial violence was high there: While you could get jumped for your clothes here in Skin Row, there you could get jumped for your skin alone.\r\nA few blocks further down, Anon reckoned he must be close, the ever-present graffiti in this part of town displaying an equal amount of anti-human and anti-scalie epitaphs. Feeling the suspicious stares of the dinos track his progress down the cracked and refuse-covered streets, Anon pulled the collar of his jacket up higher, not wanting to give them any excuses to stop him. The hunger in his belly had been replaced, driven off by the stolen chili dog and replaced by something else; an aching, burning desire to see Lucy again. Anon knew he could walk forever with that to sustain him, so long as it brought him closer to his love. \r\nAnon nearly past the pub at first, walking by the nondescript building that sat on the street corner. Any sign the building had at one point was long gone, only the skeletal remains of a pre-fabricated sign sitting above the faded door, the name \u201cDeVito\u2019s\u201d barely legible on the rough, splintered wood. Peeking through a grimy window, Anon could make out a few shapes mingling inside, patrons of scales and skin alike easing the passage into night with a few pints of cheap liquor. But no Lucy. Anon hesitated at the threshold, his stomach a tight ball of nerves and desire, before pushing the heavy bar door open. \r\nAnon grimaced, the smells of stale beer and cheap cigarettes assaulting his nose as his eyes adjusted to the gloom. A long bar ran the length of one side of the room, where a scarred Triceratops flashed Anon a cold stare, his hands busy polishing a set of chipped mugs with the cloth that hung at his waist. The rest of the bar\u2019s open space was spotted by a few small tables, the small chairs in front of them mismatched as often as no.  Few of the patrons bothered to look up at the newcomer in their midst, preferring instead the lonely company that can be found only at the bottom of a glass. Even this early, several of them were amassing quite a retinue, empty bottles littering the tabletops and bar in front of them. His eyes finally fully adjusted, Anon could spy a small stage set up at the back of the bar, several pieces of cheap sound equipment already set up around one lonely stool.\r\nSuppressing for the moment a flutter of hope, Anon made his way to the bartender, stepping between a drunken, snoring man and another who seemed eager to catch up. \u201cExcuse me, who\u2019s playing tonight? The stage, it\u2019s set up for tonight, right?\u201d Anon asked quickly, eyes flickering between the bartender and the stage, keeping his thoughts calm. The Triceratops behind the bar had arms as thick as Anon\u2019s legs, and the last thing he needed was to be run out of bar with another errant \u201ctrigga\u201d comment. \r\nThe bartender glowered at Anon, his dark eyes tracking up and down. One of the man\u2019s horns was broken, and a few others were tipped in black ink, a new fad that had arisen since Anon was off at college. It was supposed to display how many kills you had, a practice Anon seriously doubted until now. \r\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be on later tonight. You wanna watch, you buy something. Got it skinny?\u201d The gruff voice of the bartender brooked no argument, and Anon passed a few bills across the counter, not caring how many he got in return. A mug of warm beer smelling faintly of piss later, Anon was settled at the end of the bar closest to the stage, desperately willing the minutes to tick by faster. He didn\u2019t have to wait long, however: Perhaps twenty minutes later, the back door of the bar opened, revealing Anon\u2019s quarry at last.\r\nLucy was\u2026 different than Anon had seen her last. Gone was her flowing grey hair, her head shaved down instead, and gone were the professional-looking clothes, replaced instead by a grimy black tank-top displaying what was no doubt some band\u2019s slogan and a ratty pair of old black jeans. Lucy\u2019s wings looked thin, as if she had been preening again, and had been preening for some time; in fact, her entire frame seemed dangerously thin, like she didn\u2019t get enough to eat. Her face was gaunt, and dark, poorly applied make-up stifling her features. Her eyes were heavy, glancing at everything with the same disinterested stare. Tattoos patterned her arms, black twisting designs of various crudeness, matching similar ones that flashed on the backs of her hands as she fumbled with her bass. Not a guitar, but a bass, just like the one she had been forced into playing, all those years ago.\r\n\u201cLucy!\u201d Anon sprang to his feet, leaving the untouched beer on the counter as he ran over to her. Confusion ran across her face momentarily as Lucy turned his direction, confusion that was replaced by anger in a heartbeat. Something in Lucy\u2019s eyes nailed Anon\u2019s feet to the floor, causing him to stop a few feet in front of her. Rage, raw and heavy, flashed in her amber eyes, her frown quickly turning into a sneer of disgust.\r\n\u201cWho the fuck do you think you are skinny, calling me that?!\u201d One sharpened claw pointed accusingly at Anon, the others clenched in a fist. \u201cNO one calls me that, got that, shithead?!\u201d \r\nAnon couldn\u2019t believe it. When he saw Lucy come out of the back room, he had excused her appearance as an anomaly, something she had adopted at the last moment like a poorly thought costume prepared the night before Halloween; but her eyes held no recognition for him, her voice none of the usual tenderness. It was as if she was seeing him for the first time, and did not like what she saw.\r\n\u201cI-it\u2019s me, Anon\u2026 Don\u2019t you recognize me, babe?\u201d Anon\u2019s hand shook as he reached out to Lucy, faltering half-way at her withering stare. \u201cYou\u2026 you left this morning, and I\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you to-\u201c\r\nA sharp slap resonated throughout the bar, interrupting Anon\u2019s words and sending him stumbling into an empty table, the bartender\u2019s cocked eyebrow the only reaction from the others assembled in the bar. Anon could feel his face stinging from the blow, feel hot tears starting well up in his eyes. Lucy\u2019s shoulders were shaking, her wings outstretched and bristling, pure murder radiating from her lithe frame. Lucy understood what she was seeing, now.\r\n\u201cHow. DARE. YOU. Showing up here, talking to me, after all these years! Like, like nothing even happened, like we were still TOGETHER!\u201d She was yelling now, a shrieking that finally managed to pulled a few patron\u2019s attention away from their liquor. \u201cYou fucking piece of shit, after what you said to ME?! I should fucking kill you Anon, for what you did!\u201d Lucy took a step towards where Anon had slumped over the table after her slap, and then another, her fists clenching and unclenching. Her voice had dropped into a frenzied whisper, just loud enough for Anon to hear, the words cutting into him like the finest knives. \u201cI told you Trish was right about you, how you\u2019re just a no good spear-chucker, a skinny fuck who means NOTHING to me. Get the fuck outta here, right fucking now, or so help me\u2026\u201d Towering over Anon now, Lucy\u2019s eyes narrowed in pure malice, her claws fully extended: Clearly, it wasn\u2019t going to be a slap next time.\r\nWordlessly, Anon stared at Lucy, the woman whom he loved for so long, hesitating for a few moments before another scream of \u201cGO!\u201d snapped him back to reality. Letting the tears run down his face, Anon turned and fled out of the bar, running past the junkies in Skin Row, past his old apartment, past all the people in the world who didn\u2019t matter so long as Lucy was away from him. Anon ran back to his new home, the one he had intended to share with Lucy, weeping the whole while as barely managed to unlock the door in time to vomit up what felt like everything he had every eaten onto the cold hardwood of the entryway, retching and gagging on his hands and knees as tears poured out of his eyes. Anon was utterly, entirely spent, his world ripped apart in the span of a few hours. Curling into a fetal ball, not caring if he wallowed in his own vomit, Anon sat there alone, crying until he had no more tears to shed, a quiet wail escaping his lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cLucy\u2026Lucy\u2026Lucy\u2026\u201d"},"What If Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Multiple","What If Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"Chapter 4\r\n\r\nIt was at least an hour before Anon could peel himself off the floor, the smell of what he had done finally becoming too much for even his numbed senses. A roll of paper towels and some cleaning spray from the move took care of the mess on the floor, Anon moping up his sick with stiff, robotic movements. He felt worse than numb; he felt dead, like a part of him had been murdered back at the pub. Lucy\u2019s words ran over and over in his head, a echoing symphony of \u201cpiece of shit\u201d and \u201cwho means NOTHING to me\u201d playing on repeat in his head, punctuated with images of her hand lashing out at him. Again and again and again\u2026\r\nAnon snapped out of his trace, shaking his head a little, realizing he had been scrubbing the same patch of hardwood for minutes now. Back in the kitchen, the soiled paper towels discarded, Anon stood staring at the wall, searching his thoughts for what to do. Something had happened to Lucy, something awful, and she seemed to have forgotten him. Truthfully, she seemed like an entirely different Lucy, so different from the one with whom he had rekindled their relationship a month ago. Could there be anything Anon could do to rekindle that love, to reignite the spark of \u201cthem\u201d in her? Anon\u2019s face still stung from the slap she had given him earlier. Was there anything of the Lucy he knew in that woman?\r\n\u201cNo. Wherever she is, Lucy is Lucy, and I love her,\u201d Anon said to himself, out loud. \u201cNo matter what it takes, I\u2019m going to win her back.\u201d His stomach growled in agreement, reminding Anon that he hadn\u2019t kept anything down that day. Smiling, Anon moved to the bathroom to clean himself up, remembering that there was a convenience store half a block down. \u201cFood first, win her back later,\u201d He said, catching his reflection in the mirror before nodding. Nothing was going to keep him from the woman he loved, not even the woman herself.\r\nA freshly-cleaned Anon stepped out of his apartment building, his new shirt free of any vomit-stains. Despite everything that had occurred, Anon felt\u2026 confident. Maybe it was his little pep-talk he gave himself in the kitchen beforehand, or maybe it was the semblance of a plan that was forming in his head, but Anon no longer felt lost, betrayed by what had occurred. Whomever Lucy was now, whatever had happened, Anon would set it right. The streets were quiet this time of night, only a handful of others walking home in the cold autumn night, but Anon met each gaze with a smile and a nod, hoping that any confidence he projected outward would help sustain the confidence he felt within himself. \r\nIt took only a few minutes to reach the convenience store, a small Din-o-Mart situated on the corner of the block. The large neon sign displayed a smiling cartoon dinosaur eating snack by the handful, illuminating the huddled figure of a pan-handler crouched near the door of the mart. He and Lucy had grabbed some dino-nuggies here the night before, eating them out of the bag, laughing at the mess. Anon smiled at the memory as he walked to the door, trying not to make eye contact with the dirty pink raptor sitting next to an overladen shopping cart.\r\n\u201cLike, spare some change, dude?\u201d A voice from the past riveted Anon to the spot. It couldn\u2019t be, could it? He always claimed to be the richest raptor in the world\u2026 Turning his head to face the man, Anon\u2019s eyes widened in shock. Crouched low on his heels was Reed, filthy hand held out expectantly, bloodshot eyes gazing up at Anon.\r\n\u201cReed? Shit, man, is that you?\u201d Anon crouched next to the man, his nose wrinkling. \u201cWhat happened, man? Lucy and I just saw you the other day, you said you had a gig lined up!\u201d Reed\u2019s glassy eyes stared back at Anon as the question hung in the air, his obviously fried brain attempting to put the signals together. \r\n\u201cDude, is that Anon? Broooo, I haven\u2019t seen you since high-school! Gimme a hug, my man!\u201d Despite his drugged-out stupor (or perhaps because of it), Reed\u2019s old personality shone through as he and Anon stood up, embracing one another. \u201cMan, it\u2019s been, like, what, five years bro? How you been?!\u201d Reed\u2019s smile was infectious, and despite all that happened Anon found himself happy to have meet a familiar face, albeit in a strange location.\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Reed. Lucy\u2019s\u2026 We had some\u2026 Look, when was the last time you\u2019ve seen Lucy?\u201d Anon unconsciously wiped his hands on his jacket, attempting to clean the filth from Reed\u2019s back off of them. Something from Trish\u2019s diatribe earlier today tickled Anon\u2019s mind as he smiled at Reed. Trish had described Lucy as someone totally different, and he chalked it up to just another trig-out, but if Reed could confirm his suspicions\u2026 \u201cShe\u2019s not been herself lately and I just wanted to know if you\u2019ve talked to her.\u201d\r\n\u201cLucy\u2026 Lucy\u2026\u201d Anon waited patient for Reed\u2019s drug-addled brain to make the connection, hoping he wouldn\u2019t have to prompt him too much during the conversation. \u201cOh, you mean Fang! Man I haven\u2019t seen her in a looooong time, bro. Ever since she, like, killed the band, we kinda went separate ways. Me, I\u2019ve been investing in some various ventures, doing a little \u201chedge-fund\u201d management, if you catch my drift\u2026\u201d Reed winked one bloodshot eye, the pupils of his other one intermittently dilating and expanding seemingly at random. Anon wondered what he was on now, if it was safe. \u201cAnyways, bro, real shame what happened between you and Fang. I heard about it from, like, Trish, right? Suuuper hard, bro, what you said to them. You gotta\u2019 put others first, sometimes, ya\u2019 dig?\u201d Reed attempted to clap Anon on the shoulder, missing by a few inches to the left and stumbling slightly. \r\n\u201cLook, Reed, I don\u2019t know what Trish told you in the past, but Lu\u2026 Fang and I are cool now, okay? In fact, I was hoping you could help me out, I want to surprise her at work tomorrow night, but I can\u2019t remember where she plays, do you know?\u201d Anon hoped his voice didn\u2019t sound too desperate. It was a long shot, asking someone in Reed\u2019s condition for help, but Reed often saw things others didn\u2019t see. Anon smiled again, thinking of all the times Reed had helped him out in his relationship with Fang. No, damnit, she was Lucy. Lucy!\r\n\u201cNah, not Lucy, man, Fang. Like I said, I haven\u2019t seen them in a while, but, like, I know I\u2019ve heard their song a few times at this pizza place down the street, Clawfino\u2019s? Ya\u2019 know, that one and you and they wrote in high-school? That song\u2019s like, super deep man\u2026\u201d Reed wavered slightly, as if all of the sudden his legs were straining to support his weight. \u201cHey, bro, do you think you could, catch me? It hella\u2019 hurts when I fall, dude.\u201d\r\n\u201cWah\u2026 Reed, you okay man? Reed!\u201d Reed had become even more unstable, swaying back and forth like a drunk attempting to walk the line, before collapsing heavily to the side. Anon barely managed to catch Reed in time, slowing his descent enough that Anon didn\u2019t think Reed\u2019s head was too injured by the concrete. Raising one eyelid and then another, Anon could see Reed\u2019s pupils were almost entirely gone, just a small pinprick of black showing in his purple eyes. A small amount of foam had startled to collect in the corner of Reed\u2019s mouth.\r\n\u201cShit, Reed, can you hear me?! REED! Fuck, call an ambulance, quick!\u201d The manager of the Din-o-Mart had come to see what the commotion was, no doubt ready to banish the homeless vagrant from her store\u2019s entrance. At Anon\u2019s instance the woman began dialing 9-1-1, the begrudging look in her eyes telling that she didn\u2019t really care what happened to Reed, so long as he didn\u2019t die outside her store. \r\nAnon continued to cradle Reed in his arms, feeling his friend\u2019s body begin to spasm slightly. Calling out his name once more, Anon could hear the wail of the siren approaching, thankful that the hospital wasn\u2019t too far away. \r\n\u201cReed, they\u2019re almost here bro, hang in there! Reed? REED!\u201d Reed had gone suddenly limp, the spasms halting almost as soon as they had begun. It didn\u2019t seem like Reed was breathing anymore. \u201cDamnit, Reed, NO! I\u2019m not going to lose you too, bro, hang in there, please!\u201d As Anon attempted to shake his longtime friend back into consciousness, he could feel just how emaciated Reed was beneath those baggy rags, could feel the scabs that festooned Reed\u2019s hands and arms as he held him close, tears welling up once more. \r\nThe ambulance had pulled up to the curb, the EMT\u2019s quickly prying Reed out of Anon\u2019s arms, attempting to resuscitate him on the sidewalk. They said they had to get Reed to the hospital, and fast, and before they could protest Anon had jumped into the ambulance with them. \r\n\r\nHe had already almost lost someone he cared about today. Reed wasn\u2019t going to be the second.\r\n"},"What If Chapter 5.txt":{"path":["Multiple","What If Chapter 5.txt"],"text":"Chapter 5\r\n\r\nThe ER was finally quiet, the frenzied activity of Reed\u2019s arrival having finally been triaged as necessary. Anon sat alone in the waiting room, filling out medical forms as he waited for more information about Reed. The EMT\u2019s had to keep Reed\u2019s heart beating manually the whole ride over, and Anon couldn\u2019t get the image of Reed just\u2026collapsing, out of his mind. The forms themselves didn\u2019t help; a dense network of liability clauses and pre-existing conditions that Anon could only guess at. Reed of course didn\u2019t have any medical insurance, but Anon was more than happy to provide his own when prompted by the stern-faced nurse. Heaving another sign, Anon returned to the forms, attempting to make heads-or-tails of them.\r\n\u201cDoes the affiliate, or any of the affiliated, posses or maintain, herewith to the best of the provider\u2019s knowledge, an amount of provincial care not exceeding the maximum deductible amount as described in line\u2026 uhghhhhh!\u201d Anon threw his head back in disgust. He must have read that line a dozen times, his eyes sliding disinterestedly off it each time. He just wanted to make sure Reed was okay, alive and hopefully stable, before continuing his pursuit of Lucy. Glancing at his watch, Anon realized it had only been an hour since Reed had collapsed in his arms; to him, it had felt like a day.\r\n\u201cNaser would know how to fill out these forms, he always wanted to go into medicine,\u201d Anon said to the empty pastel-wallpapered room, the smell of stale disinfectant his only companion. Thinking about Lucy\u2019s brother made Anon wince. He hadn\u2019t tried Naser on the phone yet, to ask for help, but considering what Ripley and Lucy had said today, he didn\u2019t think Naser would be any wiser about what Lucy was doing. Anon hoped that wherever Lucy was, she was okay: A hospital is no place to be alone.\r\n\u201cSir, have you finished the paperwork?\u201d A kind-faced Stego nurse interrupted Anon\u2019s thoughts, her gaze friendly. Anon was thankful it wasn\u2019t the same nurse who had handed him the intake paperwork in the first place, see hadn\u2019t been pleased by Reed\u2019s smell as he was wheeled into her ER.\r\n\u201cAlmost, but I\u2019ve got a few-\u201c Anon\u2019s questions were halted by a quick smile from the nurse. \r\n\u201cExcellent! The doctor has a few questions for you, regarding the patient, could you please follow me, sir?\u201d Brisky, the nurse stepped away, not caring to look back to see if Anon was following. Scrambling after her, the intake paperwork still clutched in one hand, Anon hoped these questions wouldn\u2019t take too long. Careful to keep close to the nurse as she lead him down one winding corridor after another, Anon felt his mind wandering once more to the thought of Lucy being hurt, laying alone in a sterile hospital room, no one in her life to offer their support. Anon said a silent prayer to Raptor Jesus that his thoughts wouldn\u2019t come true.\r\n\u201cJust in there, sir,\u201d said the nurse, nodding to a door labeled \u201cE-102\u201d before turning quickly back the way they had come from. The door to the room was heavy, wide enough to fit an overly large hospital bed through, and as Anon shouldered his way through, the last person he expected to be there turned to face him: Naser, in a white doctor\u2019s coat and everything, checking on Reed\u2019s vitals.\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Naser said, turning back to Reed and leaving Anon gaping in the doorway. \u201cIt is you. Never thought I would see your face around here again, Anon.\u201d Naser\u2019s voice sounded strained, as if he was keeping something inside of him on a tight leash. Punching a few keys on Reed\u2019s monitor, he crossed around to the foot of the bed, scribbling something on Reed\u2019s chart before replacing it in the cradle on the bedframe. \u201cIt\u2019s been what, five, six years?\u201d \r\nAnon had finally worked enough moisture into his mouth to respond. \u201cNaser, I didn\u2019t\u2026What are you doing here, shouldn\u2019t you be at-\u201c\r\n\u201cAt medical school?\u201d Naser cut him off, crossing his arms underneath the badge fastened in his pocket. \u201cYeah, I already graduated from pre-med, took me two-and-a-half years. I guess it\u2019s some sort of record.\u201d Naser\u2019s dejected tone made it very clear what he thought of that record. \u201cI\u2019m just doing my internship back home, here at good ol\u2019 Volcaldera General.\u201d Still standing at the foot of the bed, Naser had made no move to welcome Anon.\r\nAnon smiled weakly, hoping to ease the tension that hung thick upon the air. Stepping into the small room, he let the door swing shut, soundless on its hydraulic piston. \u201cThat\u2019s great man, seriously. I\u2019m glad to see you, I need your-\u201c\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Naser\u2019s shout made Anon jump. Leveling a finger at Anon\u2019s chest, Naser\u2019s voice was low and hot, his anger apparent. \u201cDo you know what you put me through, what you put Fang through?! She\u2026THEY loved you man, and when you said what you said on the beach that day, it was like you drove a, a wedge or something, between all of us!\u201d Anon could only keep silent under Naser\u2019s onslaught, watching that finger as it stabbed repeatedly towards him. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get along with Mom, or Dad, or me in the first place, but after you and them broke up, it was like she was done! Done with everyone, all of her family! And guess who had to take responsibility for making amends, huh? Who Mom and Dad pushed again and again to get her back, who couldn\u2019t even breathe in his own life without Mom bursting into tears about her little \u201cPirate Princess\u201d? Ugh!\u201d Naser\u2019s hands clenched the air, his eyes staring unknowingly at them as he pushed his emotions down a troubled part of his past. \u201cWithout her, everything fell on me, everything! I had to be twice as good as I was before, I couldn\u2019t possibly do anything I wanted to, lest I end up like them! That\u2019s why I graduated so early, why I had about two hours of sleep every night for two. Whole. YEARS!\u201d \r\nSuddenly, Naser had crossed the space separating them, seizing Anon\u2019s jacket front in both hands. \u201cBecause of you, Fang is broken, and it nearly broke ME! Oh, how I wanted to hate them, to hate you, especially you, for what the two of you did to me, for what you caused!\u201d Naser\u2019s eyes were wide, his golden eyes narrowing into slits as he pressed his face closer to Anon. \u201cAnd where am I now? In fucking Volcaldera General! Even when I hate them, I STILL can\u2019t leave them alone, Anon, and do you know why? Because I LOVE them, damnit!\u201d Anon could say nothing but watch as Naser\u2019s anger deflated all at once, like a balloon with hole poked in it. Suddenly there were tears in Naser\u2019s eyes, running heedlessly down his cheeks. \r\n\u201cI could\u2019ve gone anywhere, Anon, anywhere I wanted to! Hospitals were lining up to accept me, and where do I pick? An entry-level place like Volcaldera General, just so I could be close to them. Do you know I check the ER log every single day, dreading I\u2019ll see their name on the intake log? Do you know what it\u2019s like, the only communication you can have with your own sibling to be if you find out they\u2019ve been stabbed, or raped, or, or, or DEAD, on some fucking intake log?!\u201d Naser was still gripping the front of Anon\u2019s jacket as he leaned his head onto Anon\u2019s shoulder, devolving into wordless sobs as Anon gingerly grabbed him in a comforting hug, hands move awkwardly around his wings. \r\nAnon didn\u2019t know what to say, letting Naser instead sob into his shoulder, his clothes already wet with tears. The Lucy he knew had made up with her family in the five years they were away, her relationship with her brother mended. For Naser to react this way\u2026 Anon knew at that moment that this wasn\u2019t some practical joke that everyone was playing on him, no: This was something much, much worse. Something had happened to him, not to Lucy, not to everyone else. He was like a different person to those around him, a stranger transported as if by magic into wretched lives. Looking over the sobbing form of Naser, Anon caught his reflection in a polished cabinet, saw himself as the people around him must have seen him for the first time. \r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry Naser, for what I said all those years ago. I, uh, can\u2019t remember what I said, but I know whatever it was it must\u2019ve been awful. Nothing I can say or do will make up for those years you lost, for the pain you must feel for losing her, but I just want to say that the Anon who said those things, is dead. I\u2019m a different person now.\u201d Anon moved the still-sniffling Naser off his shoulder, holding his hands on the other man\u2019s shoulders and fixing him with a level glance. \u201cLook at my eyes, Naser. I love your sister, love her with everything I am. Maybe I didn\u2019t back then, I don\u2019t know, but I realized that I want to be with her, want to keep her safe, help her heal. Can you help me, Naser? Can we help her heal?\u201d \r\nNaser\u2019s eyes widened as Anon spoke, his half-formed retort dying on his lips as Anon continued. At first, Naser couldn\u2019t understand what was happening, why the man who had crushed Fang\u2019s heart all those years ago had suddenly reappears, had suddenly confessed that he loved them. But as Naser searched in Anon\u2019s eyes for any semblance of a lie, however small, all that he was able to find, was love. \r\nNodding, Naser scraped a sleeve across his face, mopping up equal parts tears and snot. \u201cY-yeah, I\u2019ll help you Anon,\u201d he said with a shaking voice, grabbing Anon\u2019s hand as it still rested on his shoulder. \u201cMaybe you can help them, maybe not, but I\u2019d like to believe you can, anyways.\u201d Anon\u2019s face softened into a smile as he released Naser\u2019s shoulders, patting him in what Anon considered a brotherly way. \u201cBesides, they told me you took Reed in, that\u2019s got to count for something, right?\u201d\r\nAnon felt like shit right then: This whole time, he had completely forgotten whose bed they were standing next to! \u201cShit, Reed! Naser, is he going to be okay? He seemed pretty bad when they took him in.\u201d For the first time, Anon glanced down at the pink raptor, a clean hospital gown covering his skeletal frame as an IV line dripped what were probably life-saving fluids into his veins.\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty roughed up, and high on a drug cocktail that frankly should\u2019ve already killed him, but he should live. Give him some time to detox, and he\u2019ll be back to normal.\u201d Naser paused as both of them considered Reed in his normal state. \u201cOk, well he\u2019ll be okay, I can say that.\u201d Anon clapped Naser on the back in thanks, returning the younger man\u2019s smile. \r\n\r\n\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s go help Lucy.\u201d"},"What If Chapter 6.txt":{"path":["Multiple","What If Chapter 6.txt"],"text":"Chapter 6\r\n\r\nNaser seemed excited at the prospect of reconnecting with his sister. After washing his face, he managed to snag a few minutes away from work, enough to drive Anon back to the neighborhood near Clawfino\u2019s, making sure Anon promised to keep in touch before speeding off in the NasCar 2.0, a slick black mid-engine sports car. Checking his watch, Anon figured he still had a few hours until Lucy\u2019s show would end, having decided that making a scene during her set wasn\u2019t the best idea. Still, plenty of time to finally get some food in his stomach.\r\nAs Anon toured around the neighborhood near Lucy\u2019s venue, finishing the last few bites of the sandwich he picked up from a market some blocks away, he wondered what he would say to Lucy. Sure, he and Naser had hashed out what in general to say, as well as what to avoid, but it was the specifics that weighed on Anon\u2019s mind. Would Lucy even give him the time to say his piece, or would she react like she did earlier today at DeVito\u2019s? Anon needed something to break the ice with her, some sort of peace offering, but what? Dusting the last bit of crumbs from his lapels, Anon spied a flower store further down the block. Flowers had never been Lucy\u2019s coup of tea, but people seemed to do this sort of thing in the movies all the time. At any rate, it would give Lucy something to make fun of, besides himself. \r\nNearing the small store, Anon could see through the window that they were getting ready to close, the two women running the shop cleaning up their emptied-out display shelves. Glancing around, Anon found the name of the store: \u201cRosa\u2019s Rosas\u201d. She probably thought that was funny, even. Smiling, Anon pushed open the front door, not quite sure what to expect.\r\n\u201cExcuse me, se\u00f1or, but we are closing now. If you would like to come\u2026back\u2026tomorrow\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s words trailed off as she turned to greet her newest customer. Contrary to Reed, the years had treated Rosa well, her femininity only getting more refined with age. A long white apron covered her floral-print dress, not unlike the one she had often worn in high-school, and a matching white bandana kept her long curls away from her face. Her eyes held the same kindness that Anon remembered, although they were currently wide with shock.\r\n\u201cHey, Rosa, it\u2019s uh, been a while.\u201d Anon\u2019s attempt at small talk fell upon deaf ears as Rosa continued to stare at him, her mouth silently working. \u201cI was hoping you could, um, help me with something? Rosa? Hello?\u201d The moment stretched on, Rosa still unable to do anything but gape at him like a fish. Finally, just as Anon was getting ready to say his awkward goodbyes, Rosa erupted, shouting as she fled into the store\u2019s back room.\r\n\u201cSTELLA! VEN R\u00c1PIDO! IT\u2019S AN-ON!\u201d Muffled conversation spilled from the back room behind the store\u2019s counter, an unintelligible stream of Spanish totally beyond Anon\u2019s little vocabulary. Shortly thereafter, Rosa returned, dragging behind her longtime partner in crime. The stego girl was much as Anon remembered, sporting a cringey anime top over ragged jeans, her white apron of mess of plant stains. Mostly is was her hair that changed: Gone were the twin buns that Stella sported in high-school, replaced by an elaborate plait pulled over one shoulder. Like Rosa, her blue eyes stared widely at Anon, herself unable to do more than gawk as Rosa ran over to wrap Anon in a big hug.\r\n\u201cHey Rosa, it\u2019s good to see you t- OW!\u201d Rosa had broken the hug quickly, moving instead to smack Anon upside the head, her eyes flashing.\r\n\u201c\u00a1Pendejo! Do you know what you did, An-on! You broke that poor girl\u2019s heart! And you come back now?\u201d Rosa punctuated each sentence with another smack, her arms having lost none of their strength as Anon held his hands up to protect himself. Finally, she pulled Anon into another hug, whispering under her breath. \u201cDios lo perdone\u2026\u201d Anon let the events play out as they were, unable to bring himself to speak in his defense. Whatever he had done in this life, it seemed everyone knew about it. \r\n\u201cLet him go Rosa, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s been through a lot to come back here.\u201d Stella had moved closer in the meantime, wrapping Anon in a hug of her own as Rosa stepped back, wiping an errant tear from one eye. \u201cAnon, I\u2019m so sorry for what happened between you and Fang. I guess my readings back then weren\u2019t very accurate\u2026\u201d A brief flash of sadness darkened Stella\u2019s features as she took a step back, her comments about her tarot readings prompting Rosa to fish her familiar rosary beads out from her pocket. \u201cStill, you must\u2019ve done something these past years! Oh, did you watch this new anime series that came out? It\u2019s called Space-\u201c\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think An-on came by to talk about that, Stella dear. Come, Anon, sentarse. You must tell us everything!\u201d Rosa pulled Anon gently by the arm towards the counter where two tall stools sat on either side, her and Stella taking their seats with practiced ease. Anon lowered himself gingerly onto the hard stool. This wasn\u2019t at all what he expected when he considered seeing Rosa and Stella again. He figured out from Naser that the news of the other Anon\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s breakup was well known throughout the school by the end, but from Naser\u2019s hurried explanation as he sped through traffic, it seemed that whatever this other Anon had done, it was truly awful. Rosa and Stella weren\u2019t close with Lucy by any means, but for them to be so understanding\u2026\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I can explain, really, except I\u2019ve come back for Lucy, to apologize for anything I said to her, maybe even everything I said\u2026\u201d Fidgeting with a stray leaf still resting on the counter, Anon\u2019s eyes fell from the gaze of the two women. He hadn\u2019t even done whatever the other Anon had done, and he still felt guilty about it! \u201cBut that\u2019s all in the past now. I want to make it up to her, I want her to be happy again, and I think I can do that.\u201d\r\n\u201cAhh, el amor encuentra un camino\u2026\u201d Rosa blew her nose heavily on a handkerchief pulled from her pocket, and at the same time Stella\u2019s face lit up. \r\n\u201cAh, I knew this was going to happen! A few days ago, I did another reading, and it was\u2026weird, somehow. I dunno, but the cards were all mixed up. It was like I was doing a reading for someone who wasn\u2019t even there!\u201d Stella\u2019s hands slowly crept up, her elbows held tightly to her sides, assuming the same position she had always adopted whenever she was excited. \u201cRosa doesn\u2019t want to believe in what I see, but it must be true!\u201d\r\n\u201cAhh, I do not want to believe it because it is black magic, Stella! An-on must follow his heart, not some cartas paganas!\u201d Stella deflated somewhat at Rosa\u2019s chastisement, but her face still held that familiar beaming look in it. Reaching across the counter, Rosa took Anon\u2019s hand, squeezing it hard around the rosary. \u201cYou have to go to her, An-on. Go to Fang and tell her how you feel!\u201d\r\nSmiling, Anon squeezed back briefly, glancing between the two old friends. \u201cThat\u2019s actually why I was here. I thought, maybe, if I brought some flowers, or something, she might\u2026 I mean, I know Lucy was never one for flowers, but\u2026\u201d Anon\u2019s words trailed off as Rosa and Stella beamed at him. \u201cWhat? What did I say?\u201d \r\nWordlessly, Rosa turned to the workbench behind her, where assorted flowers and cuttings littered the steel work surface. Carefully, she selected one long-stemmed flower, the red blossom looking somewhat familiar to Anon. Holding it out to him, Rosa smiled, tears shimmering in her eyes. \r\n\u201cMiddlemist Red Camelias, An-on. You show her this, and she will understand.\u201d Stella blew her nose loudly, reduced to a blubbering mess on the other side of the counter. \r\nAnon accepted the flower carefully, twirling it between his fingers slowly as he moved towards the door. \u201cRosa, Stella, I can\u2019t thank you both enough for this. I don\u2019t know how to\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cOh, just go, you pendejo! Before you make Stella cry more!\u201d Stella was indeed weeping now, her face a mixture of emotions too complex for Anon to decipher at first glance. With a final wave back to the two women, Anon pushed himself back into the cold night, the shop bell ringing merrily as he exited. He could see thick clouds starting to form overhead, intent on making good on the weather forecast\u2019s promise of rain. Hold his flower close to his body with both hands, Anon set off on the final leg of his journey: Clawfino\u2019s. \r\n\r\nHe hoped Lucy would understand. "},"What If Chapter 7.txt":{"path":["Multiple","What If Chapter 7.txt"],"text":"Chapter 7\r\n\r\nFang stepped out of the back door of the pizza place, into the dingy alleyway. Standing close to the door, she lit a cigarette with practiced ease, holding her hand out to protect the little flame from the rain. It had started raining mid-way through her set, ensuring what little crowd had remained would be the only crowd she got. No one liked going anywhere in the rain. Now, a few hours later, she was getting ready to leave, having distributed the frankly pathetic tip amount to the other members of the band. These gigs were paying even less nowadays as well. She started to pull out a wad of bills from the pocket of her torn-up black jeans, hand half-way out before stuffing them back again. She knew how little was in there, how it wouldn\u2019t be enough to make rent. She would have to start finding more venues to play at, more shitty bars and dead-end restaurants desperate enough to book the likes of her. Pulling a deep drag, Fang let the smoke flow slowly out of her mouth, staring up into the sky. \r\n\u201cFuck,\u201d she said quietly, the rain drumming a soft tempo on the dumpster next to her. Checking her phone, it was a little after midnight, still far too early to return to her run-down studio apartment. Returning to early on any given night allowed her too much time to dwell on her life, on just how fucked she was. Better to stay out late, pushing herself to the edge of consciousness, maybe find a few parties where she could bum some booze off some wasted teenagers. That way, she only had to get through the door before collapsing onto the futon that served as her bed, the sweet darkness of sleep welcoming her. \r\nSoon, that darkness of sleep wasn\u2019t going to be enough.\r\n\u201cFuck,\u201d repeated Fang, her cigarette already reduced to the small nub of the filter. \u201cHow did it get to this\u2026\u201d\r\nFrom the back door to Clawfino\u2019s, she could see the entrance of the alley, watched as the occasional car rolled on through the night. A fluorescent lamp doused the area near the door in bright light, spoiling Fang\u2019s night vision somewhat. That was probably why she didn\u2019t see him until he stepped into that white halo, the rain masking his footsteps, some skinny fuck probably thinking she was an easy mark. With a snarl fang reached for her guitar case, the black plastic having served as an effective weapon in the past. \r\n***\r\nAnon could see her standing there, huddled close to the building and out of the rain, the white glow of the lamp shining down on her. Lucy looked tired, unbelievably tired, like she hadn\u2019t slept in days, like there was something in her sleep that made her afraid. Raindrops fell down her face as she pulled another drag from her cigarette, following the curves and lines of her face, small drops from heaven for the girl who had long ago shed her last tear. Standing there, awash in the light and rain, Lucy looked beautiful and sad, like the perfect flower plucked carelessly from the earth and discarded into the street. Drawing a deep breathe, Anon walked towards her, the rain rolling down his face, the flower carefully shielded in his jacket. As Anon stepped into that pool of light, Lucy finally took notice of him, a wordless snarl forming on her lips as she reached for her case.\r\n\u201cLu\u2026Fang, wait, it\u2019s me! Anon! I just want to talk, okay?\u201d The case didn\u2019t lower an inch, Lucy still crouched by the door, ready to bash his head in if need be. Her dull eyes flashed malice as she squinted towards him.\r\n\u201cYou again? I told you to fuck off, Anon! I don\u2019t want to talk to you, I don\u2019t want to hear your bullshit!\u201d\r\nUndeterred, Anon took a half-step forward, watching as the heavy black plastic case was raised another inch, Lucy\u2019s arms ready to strike. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t want to talk to me, but I want to say something to you. If you don\u2019t like what I have to say, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll leave you alone. Forever.\u201d Anon could hear the pleading in his voice, knew he was desperate for Lucy to stay. If he could just talk to her\u2026. \u201cPlease?\u201d\r\nSeconds passed, the steady drumbeat of the rain the only noise in the dark alley. Slowly, she put down the guitar case, her eyes never leaving Anon. She remained tensed, like a cornered animal, unsure if it needed to strike out or flee. \u201cFine. Say what it is you came to say, then get the fuck outta\u2019 here and leave me alone.\u201d\r\nTaking a deep breath, Anon started into the speech he had been going over in his head for the past few hours. \u201cFang, I\u2019m sorry for how-\u201c\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re SORRY? Fuck Anon, you\u2019re about four fucking years too late for a SORRY! Look, if that\u2019s what you came here to say, I don\u2019t need to listen to this shit, I\u2019m leaving.\u201c She turned to leave, grabbing her case with one hand as she started down the alley. \r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for how your life has turned out. Playing at these shitty gigs, in the bad part of town. You deserve better than this in life, Fang, better than anything I could give you.\u201d Anon watched as Lucy paused, her back to him, just on the edge of the light. \u201cWhat I said those years ago doesn\u2019t matter right now. I was, uh, a different person when I said those things, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you should have more than this.\u201d Anon paused for a moment, working more moisture into his mouth.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I should have more.\u201d Fang turned, fighting to keep the sadness out of her voice, a sadness she had buried deep inside of herself. \u201cI SHOULD have friends, a family, a real band. I SHOULD have all the things I dreamed about in high-school, back when I was happy. But what do I have now?\u201d She gestured with her guitar case. \u201cI have a fucked up life, with no friends, no family. I play bass in a band I hate, in clubs and bars that barely even know I exist except from the name on the set list. I have no past, no future, no life. I should be making something of myself, but instead I\u2019m standing in the rain listening to YOU!\u201d  A sudden burst of anger, bright and hot, bubbled up through her. Clenching her free hand in a fist, she waved it at him, wishing she could crush that stupid bald head of his. \u201cA fucker, a nobody, a LESS than nobody, who had the gall to come to me and tell me how sad MY life is! FUCK you, Anon, you little piece of-\u201c\r\nHe didn\u2019t let her finish, cutting her off mid-sentence. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Fang! I am somebody. I\u2019m somebody who can\u2019t stop thinking about you, all these years later.\u201d Fang could see the color rising in his cheeks as he took a step closer to her, his hands till clenched underneath his jacket. \u201cI\u2019m somebody who remembers the joy you used to have in playing music. I\u2019m somebody who remembers the song we played on the roof of the high-school. I\u2019m somebody who remembers what you said to me, who can\u2019t stop remembering what you said. Damnit Fang, I\u2019m somebody who loved you!\u201d Anon\u2019s voice caught suddenly, and as he stood there Fang thought she could see tears beginning to fall. From inside his jacket, Anon withdrew a single red flower, holding it limply at his side. Something about that flower stirred Fang\u2019s memory, from a past that she had thought buried.\r\nFang could see Anon\u2019s shoulders quake, hear his voice strain to fight back the sobs. \u201cFang, please\u2026Please, let me love you again, let me share in your horrible life. Because as bad as your life may be now, my life without you is worse.\u201d Fang said nothing: She could only stare at him, her mouth slightly open, fighting to find that anger once more, to tell him to go fuck off, that she didn\u2019t need anyone anymore. That anger had sustained her when all of her other defenses had failed, had been the coal that had never stopped burning. But tonight, as Fang reached for that anger, she realized that it had stopped burning long ago, that she had been stoking it herself, desperate to find an emotion, any emotion, left inside of her. In this dark alley, behind a shitty venue, in this pissing rain, she realized that just maybe, she could find another emotion. \r\n***\r\nLucy stared at Anon wordlessly, her tired eyes searching his face. Luckily the sobbing had died down, withering away in that cold stare. He had poured everything of himself into those words, told Lucy the absolute truth about himself, how he felt about her, and all she could do was stare at him. Anon refused to say something, lest he break the fragile silence, lest he prevent Lucy from saying the words he desperately wanted to hear. Seconds rolled on, the rain beating its staccato drumbeat on the world.\r\nFinally, hesitantly, Lucy stepped near him, her had shaking as she reached out for the camelia. Brushing his fingertips briefly, Lucy slipped the flower from his limp hands, twirling it around her fingers just as he did. Unable to look anywhere else, Anon watched as Lucy dropped the flower, her guitar case, watched as she wrapped her arms around his back, burying her face in his chest. Holding her gently to him, Anon watched as her lithe form began to shake, her muffled sobs barely audible against the rain. Silently the two of them stood there, letting the rain fall down, letting it wash away their past, their uncertain future reaching out in front of them.\r\n***\r\nLucy\u2019s studio apartment was only a few blocks from the alley where the two of them had reunited. Except to give directions, Lucy had said nothing, had only held onto his hand as she lead him through the dark, rain-slicked streets. Anon could feel her leaning into him, supporting her as best he could. All he wanted to do was collapse into her arms, but right now he could sense that she needed him a little more than he needed her. The last few hours had been a blur to Anon, and he didn\u2019t dare remember waking up without Lucy, lest she fade away like mist once more. Arriving at the run-down building Lucy called home, she had murmured something about her apartment number before collapsing into Anon, falling at once into a deep sleep. Smiling, Anon carried her in his arms, attempting to fish the keys from her pocket without disturbing her or dropping her guitar case, pushing the door open with his back when he finally managed to open it.\r\nLucy\u2019s studio was a disaster. Half-eaten takeout containers mingled with clean and dirty clothes on the floor, and the sink in the small kitchen was dripping steadily. The only furniture Anon could see was a ragged old futon couch, the red fabric of the upholstery stained and littered with cigarette burns. Leaning the case against the wall, Anon carefully laid Lucy on the couch, covering her with his wet jacket as she snuggled down. Not wishing to disturb her, Anon sat on the floor next to her, watching her chest rise and fall in rhythm with the sink. Drip. Breathe in. Drip. Breathe out. \r\n\r\n\u201cShe really was the most beautiful thing,\u201d Anon mumbled as he eased himself into a blissful sleep, finally reunited with his Lucy.\r\n"},"What If Epilogue.txt":{"path":["Multiple","What If Epilogue.txt"],"text":"Epilogue\r\n\r\nA breeze blew into the small studio apartment, slightly disturbing the curtains as it did so. The wind didn\u2019t have very far to go in this small space as it rattled empty take-out containers, swirling around discarded clothes as it circled the small room. Into the deepest part of the room it blew, passing across the new again, but once old, couple of Fang and Anon. Only Anon felt it though; Fang had long since passed out, finally giving into the rejuvenating sleep that she so desperately craved, content that she was safe at last. Anon\u2019s bare arms prickled against the cold autumn air, his jacket long since given over to Fang. It was only hours since he and Fang had gotten back together, a few months since his return to Volcaldera after his long stay away with the Navy.

The wind swirled around the still-unpacked room, past boxes left haphazardly throughout the small one-bedroom apartment, rustling the fresh bouquet of flowers with a large \u201cCongratulations!\u201d balloon still tied to the vase. Deeper still it flew, into the bedroom, freshly christened by the young couple of Lucy and Anon. Only Anon felt it, though; Lucy had long since fallen asleep, exhausted from the move out of her parents house and from\u2026 other things. Anon\u2019s bare chest prickled with goosebumps for a moment as he lay there, hands folded behind his head, smiling up at the celling. One month since he and Lucy got back together, one month since his return to Volcaldera after his long stay away from the love of his life. As his eyes drifted shut, Anon listened to the breeze whistle softly through the apartment he shared with Lucy, utterly content at the new life he was about to start.\n\nThe wind blew in from the open window, bringing a new beginning; but it was not the beginning anyone could have imagined.\n\nAnon rubbed the sleep from his eyes, sitting up in his new bed, the shadows of unpacked boxes lingering in the morning gloom. Yawning sleepily, he made his way to the bathroom, the tap sputtering slightly as he washed his face, preparing to face the first day of the rest of his life. Still unused to the new surroundings, Anon cast his gaze around for his toothbrush before realizing it was still packed away. Lucy had been very insistent that they pick up where they left off, and that did not include unpacking right then. \u201cMy parents bought us this bed, Anon. We should break it in, just to make sure it\u2019s a good one\u2026\u201d Smiling, Anon wiped his face on his sleeve: A part of him was surprised that bed was still in one piece! His eyes adjusted to the morning gloom, Anon stared into the mirror\u2019s reflection, angling to get a glance at the woman who had so effortlessly captured his heart.\nLucy wasn\u2019t there.\nFrowning, Anon turned, quickly stepping into the bedroom, the empty room mocking his previously contentment. Something was strange about the room, and not just for the lack of Lucy. The stacks of unpacked boxes seemed\u2026 smaller, the bedframe different. Anon shivered against the breeze that blew in from the opened window down the hall, his panic growing.\n\u201cLucy? Lucy, where are you?\u201d Anon cried out, crossing the room quickly to peek into the closet. Nothing. Calling out again, his footsteps quickened on the hardwood of the hallway, his gaze frantically checking the second bathroom, the kitchen, the living space. Nothing. No balloon, no flowers, no Lucy. It was as if she had just\u2026 vanished, taking with her all aspects of their shared life. Anon could feel his heartbeat ringing in his ears as he rushed back to the bedroom, numb fingers fumbling through his pants pocket for his phone. \n\u201cJ-just out getting coffee, probably\u2026\u201d Anon had never gotten over his mumbling, the frequency always increased in times of stress. Checking his phone, the wrongness of the morning continued. Someone had deleted Lucy\u2019s number from his speed-dial, changed his background from a smiling selfie he had taken with Lucy on the pier to some esoteric landscape shot. The phone quaked in his hands as he punched in a familiar number, one he had memorized since returning: Lucy\u2019s number.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry, the number you are trying to reach is no longer in service. If you would like to-\u201c Anon cut off the robotic voice with a touch of his thumb. His chest felt like it was going to burst, his breathing ragged. Anon quickly tapped up a new phone call, struggling to remember the number of Lucy\u2019s parents\u2019 house.\nOne ring, followed by a second. \nA third seemed to stretch out into infinity.\n\u201cHello? This had better be good buddy, it\u2019s seven in the damn morning!\u201d The rough voice of Ripley crackled through the phone, and for the first time Anon felt relief at hearing the voice of Lucy\u2019s father.\n\u201cRipley, it\u2019s Anon. Look, Lucy\u2019s not a home, did she say anything to you, say she was going anywh-\u201c\nBefore Anon can finish, Ripley cuts him off, nearly yelling at this point. \u201cAnon? Who the fuck is that? Who\u2019s calling?!\u201d A gnawing pit of fear feasts on Anon\u2019s stomach as he takes another deep breathe to calm himself down.\n\u201cAnon, sir, Lucy\u2019s boyfriend? Y-you helped us move in together yesterday.\u201d Anon can\u2019t help but keep the stammer from his voice. Ripley was a strong man, in both mind and body, there\u2019s no way Alzheimer\u2019s could have caught him this fast. Working some moisture into his mouth, Anon continued his desperate plea to the ptero-patriarch on the phone. \u201cI woke up this morning, and she was just\u2026gone, and I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d\n\u201cLucy\u2019s boyfriend? You little shit, how dare you bring her name up to me! I haven\u2019t spoken to Lucy, to Fang in years! Why the fuck would I care if you moved in with that good-for-nothing shit, I ought to run a trace on you and beat the shit outta you, you little \u2013\u201c\nAnon cuts the call off, the phone slipping from his hands. He and Lucy had lunch with her parents just yesterday, and Lucy had lived in their house before deciding on moving into a new apartment with her boyfriend, Anon. Anon, the one currently standing alone, in an empty home, with no sign of the love of his life to be found.\n\nSomething had gone very, very wrong.","Title":"What If","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Tracy, Rosa, Stella and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Anonymous","Summary":"What if the Anon from ending 4 ended up in Ending 2?"}},"Naser And Nasera":{"Altered Paths - Nasera Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Naser And Nasera","Altered Paths - Nasera Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: Altered Paths - Nasera\nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Nasera and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: Rangto\nSummary: In an alternate universe not that different from the one you know, Anon decides to join his new High School's sports clubs after its president, the beautiful and outgoing Nasera, convinces him to. Unfortunately for Anon, he's not exactly the fittest human around. Hilarity ensues as he tries to do his best to not only fit into his new role, all the while his feelings for the club's president grow by the day.\n\n\nChapter 1: Join the Club\n\nYou know the story by now. Probably know it well. The story of Anon Y Mous and Lucy Aaran. \n\nThe story of how a lost boy and a broken girl found each other through the coming-of-age quagmire. \n\nIt\u2019s a story as old as time; a lost boy and a broken girl get to know each other, grow to admire qualities in one another, and help each other rise above all the hell that life puts one through.\n\nYou know of their struggle to find themselves and their effort to make sense of the world around them, one that\u2019s often cruel and uncaring. You\u2019ve seen how they find each other in their darkest hour and how they helped pull each other out of that darkness and into a brighter future. \n\nYou have seen them achieve the height of happiness in each other\u2019s embrace, but you\u2019ve also seen them reach the lowest possible points in their lives, often resulting in untold suffering to them and all those around them...\n\nBut the tale of Anon and Lucy isn\u2019t the only story to tell. Out there, there are thousands of possibilities, thousands of altered paths, each more different than the last.\n\nAll it takes is one different variable to alter the course of history and the flow of fate...\n\nWhy don\u2019t we check in on one such possibility?\n\nThe year is 201M2020 BC.\n\nAnon Y Mous, a human teenager of eighteen years of age, recently transferred to a brand new school named Volcano High.\n\nHe once attended a school farther north named Rock Bottom High, located in the human town of the same name. Rock Bottom itself is a mountain town of not much fame aside from its winter Skiing resorts. \n\nFrom an outsider\u2019s viewpoint, it isn\u2019t a place of much renown. More so outside of the winter season. If anything, Rock Bottom\u2019s the kind of place you go to be unremarkable and to lead a quiet, if unhappy, life.\n\nThis is the place Anon hails from. This is the world this young man has always known; a dull, unremarkable life. Is it little wonder that he tried filling the void with the power of anime waifus?\n\nDon\u2019t answer that.\n\nUnfortunately for Anon, his little passion came to light thanks to a fellow student who didn\u2019t think too fondly of him, outing the information in possibly the most embarrassing way imaginable: Chain emails.\n\nAs a result of that embarrassment and subsequent harassment, the young man transferred out of Rock Bottom High, which meant he had to bid his boring old town and boring old life farewell.\n\nAs fate would have it, the only other school within a hundred miles willing to accept his transfer so late into the school year was Volcano High, located in the bustling city known as Volcaldera Bluffs.\n\nWhile a setback in many ways, most consider moving schools and towns a chance to start again. Indeed, it is something most people would jump on and embrace wholeheartedly.\n\nOnly, there are two problems:\n\nProblem one. Volcaldera Bluffs is a predominantly dino city. As such, dinosaurs don't view humans in the best light. This meant that the school Anon would transfer into would also be a predominantly dino school. Humans like Anon might find it challenging to blend in.\n\nProblem two. Anon isn\u2019t exactly like most people. People who would make the most out of the cards dealt to them and adapt to new friends and new challenges. Instead, Anon only wishes to scoot by unseen and unknown, finishing his last six months of school and vanishing altogether into a life of mediocrity.\n\nBut as fate would also have it, his plans went out the window when he set eyes on her.\n\nLet's check up on Anon. See what the petite caveman's been up to since his transfer to Volcano High...\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a whole week since I transferred out of Rock Bottom High. \n\nI never actually expected to get so used to the cavalcade of cereal mascots that surround me on the daily. Yet here I am, not even minding that I\u2019m surrounded by what some of my old classmates would confuse for a furry convention. \n\nVolcano High isn\u2019t at all like back home. Over in Rock Bottom, I think I only ever recall seeing one or two dinos at school. It\u2019s the complete inverse of Volcano High now that I think about it. I wonder if that\u2019s because the temperature back home\u2019s better suited for humans or if dinos just don\u2019t like to live up in the mountains.\n\nWell, whatever the case, I\u2019m not in Rock Bottom anymore. I shouldn\u2019t think of that old town as my home anymore. Though now that I think about it, did Rock Bottom ever feel like home? I had a house and parents, even if they did everything they could do to avoid having to deal with me. I bet they\u2019re overjoyed over not having to house me anymore.\n\nI put those thoughts out of my mind as I head down the hallways, all the while wondering what kind of strange things the day would bring me.\n\nI haven\u2019t even taken more than twenty steps when I run across the Aaran sisters chatting away with Trish and Reeda. Almost on cue, one of the Aaran siblings, a beautiful and well-toned ptero of light brown scales, a dark auburn toned hair, wing feathers, and an orange crest, turns to face me. As always, aside from her natural beauty, the other thing I always notice is her asymmetrical profile, her left wing atrophied into a stumpy little thing. \n\nSince meeting Nasera on my first day of school, I\u2019ve been curious to know the story behind that clipped wing of hers. Something tells me that it might be a very sore subject to bring up in casual conversation. Literally and figuratively.\n\nI don\u2019t know how it is with dinos, but I find that Nasera\u2019s injury gives her an air of uniqueness and strength, which only serves to amplify the rest of her natural beauty in a way that I can\u2019t describe. Maybe I find scars appealing? Perhaps I have a kink for survivors? It could be the idea of someone carrying on with life despite such a disability that makes something in the back of my mind click. \n\nOr it could be all the anime I\u2019ve watched over the years...\n\n\u201cHey, Anon!\u201d Nasera chirps as she leaves her group of friends and makes her way towards me, a smile on her lips and a sway to her hips that almost makes me spill my spaghetti. \n\nI stop in my tracks and do my best not to look like I\u2019m too dumbfounded by the Jurassic beauty before me. Especially since I can see Nasera\u2019s more rebellious sister, Fang, fuming a bit in my periphery. The monochromatic ptero isn\u2019t bad-looking by any means, but compared to her sister, she comes off as a bit plain. Yet, something about her lack of color also draws me to her. In a way, it reminds me of myself since I\u2019m also considered \u2018plain\u2019 by human standards, with my lack of hair and almost non-existent features. I wonder if that makes me appear unique to dinos? It could be an interesting thing to ask one next time I get a chance to. \n\n\u201cHow\u2019s my favorite skinnie doing this fine Monday morning? Get in some good hunting before coming to school?\u201d Nasera asks, all the while making a spearing motion with her arms.  \n\nI let out a sigh and ignore Nasera\u2019s oh-so-casual bout of racism. I almost expect it considering she doesn\u2019t get to interact with many other humans daily. Well, aside from Principal Spears. The jury is still out about him, though. He looks human enough, but something tells me he hails from more\u2026 primitive stock. Probably closer to a neanderthal than a homo sapien. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he had some dino genes in him as well.\n\nActually, can dinos and humans even have kids with each other? According to cheesy romance stories, yes. Real life tends to be more boring than that, though. Guess that\u2019s another thing to research later. For science, of course.  \n\nI hear a snicker coming from behind Nasera and glance towards Fang, Reeda, and Trish. I notice the tiny purple triceratops doing her absolute best not to burst out laughing in that little glance. Stupid little trigga probably told Nasera to greet me as she did.\n\nI also ignore the daggers Fang is shooting at me with her amber-toned eyes. It's not my fault that Nasera is still my welcoming committee to Volcano High. If Fang wants to blame someone, she should blame Naomi. She\u2019s the one that put Nasera up to it for reasons I can\u2019t even fathom\u2026\n\nI let out a forced chuckle and put on my best fake smile. \u201cUh\u2026 Nasera? Humans don\u2019t hunt for their food anymore. We go to supermarkets just like everybody else.\u201d\n\nNasera blinks a few times and turns a glare towards Trish, who turns away from the ptero and whistles.\n\nCalled it. Trish, you little bitch\u2026\n\nNasera lets out a sigh and puts a hand on my shoulder, all the while giving me an easy smile. \u201cF-forget I said that,\u201d she stammers out. \u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d\n\nI give Nasera an indifferent shrug. \u201cPretty chill. Finally got the last of my things unpacked and got to enjoy some quality me time.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? And what exactly does \u2018you\u2019 time constitute, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d\n\nWell shit. Didn\u2019t think my words through enough. Fucking walked right into that one.\n\nScrambling for an answer, I let out an innocent giggle and rub the back of my head. \u201cOh, you know. A little vidya here, some catching up on tv shows there\u2026\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t say shitposting on basket weaving forums\u2026 \n\nDon\u2019t say shitposting on Mongolian throat singing newsletters\u2026 \n\n\u201c...And a healthy dose of browsing the internet\u2026 to shitpost...\u201d\n\nOh fucking goddammit...\n\n\u201cShitpost?\u201d Nasera asks, looking at me with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s a shitpost?\u201d\n\n\u201cANYWAY!\u201d I say, quickly taking the reins of the conversation before the bombastic ptero heads down a road I\u2019m not qualified to even attempt to explain to her. \u201cDidn\u2019t do much else after that. I just chilled and waited for Monday to roll around. I swear!\u201d\n\nNasera looks at me with a narrowed look before she smiles again. \u201cSounds super boring!\u201d she remarks, reaching into her pocket and pulling out a folded piece of paper. \u201cWhat you need to do is find yourself an activity to keep you nice and busy during your off-time. You know what they say about idle minds, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d I answer, not quite sure where Nasera is even taking the conversation.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 something about idle minds leading to idle hands\u2026 which then leads to lost time?\u201d Nasera herself shrugs as she hands me the piece of paper. \u201cMy point is, I want you to join my club!\u201d\n\nI unfold the paper Nasera trusted to me and read it over. \n\nIt\u2019s a flyer for Volcano High\u2019s sports club. It\u2019s a fancy and intricate flyer, complete with bold lettering and pictures of various fitness activities. I can\u2019t help but notice that more than half of the photos are of Nasera doing the exercises while wearing a pair of short shorts and a skin-tight tank-top that leaves nothing to the imagination.\n\nI\u2019m very thankful that my pants are on the baggy side. Otherwise, I\u2019m pretty sure the tent I\u2019d be pitching right now would be very noticeable to the four girls in my vicinity\u2026 \n\nNasera looks at me expectantly, the smile on her lips wide, warm, and very much welcoming. I give the paper another cursory glance before looking at the ptero in the eye with a surprised and confused expression.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 Why do you want me to join your sports club?\u201d\n\n\u201cGlad you asked!\u201d Nasera says as she wraps an arm around my shoulder and begins walking me down the hallway, away from the rest of her friends and most of the other students passing by. \u201cFor all the last thirty years that Volcano High has been open, our school has prided itself in being among the top athletic institutions in all Dinofornia. We have dozens of trophies proving it and countless awards that we can\u2019t even find the room to display!\u201d She stops us right in front of one such awards display. True to her word, it\u2019s full of all kinds of athletic awards. So many that a few have to sit behind some of the larger trophies on display.\n\n\u201cNotice something missing among all the photos, though?\u201d Nasera asks as she lets go of me so I can take a closer look. \n\nI crouch down and begin scanning the photographs. As I do, I fail to spot anything out of the ordinary with them. \n\n\u201cUh\u2026 I don\u2019t see anything off.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook closer,\u201d Nasera commands as she also crouches next to me. She points to a few of the pictures and moves a finger around, almost as if trying to force my attention on a specific fact that continues to elude me.\n\nI stand up and let out a sigh. \u201cSorry, I only see pictures of dinos doing sporty things.\u201d\n\n\u201cEXACTLY!\u201d Nasera almost shouts as she also stands up and again wraps her arm around my shoulder, bringing me so close to her being that we almost touch cheeks. \u201cFor the last thirty years, there hasn\u2019t been a single skinn\u2014human\u2014in our sports department!\u201d She turns to face me and gets even closer to me. So close that the tip of her snoot almost makes contact with my nose. \u201cWe don\u2019t get many of you guys here in Volcano High. The last one of your kind was Principal Spears ten years ago, and he never joined the sports club despite his physical prowess. Which brings me to you!\u201d Nasera\u2019s smile grows wider, her very eyes shining as the excitement overflows from her. \u201cT-this is the perfect opportunity to make history. You can be the first human to join Volcano High\u2019s sports club. Think of the fame, the recognition, the college acceptance letters!\u201d  \n\nDespite the little caveman in the back of my mind jumping for joy at the fact that a femoid\u2014and a scorching hot one at that\u2014was making contact with me, my rational side takes over and forces my body to slip out of Nasera\u2019s grip. As I do, my mind races as various things become clear to me: Why Naomi set Nasera up as my welcome party, why Nasera\u2019s been so friendly and clingy, heck, maybe even why I got into Volcano High so quickly in the first place.\n\nMy more pessimistic side wants to turn tail and leave. I\u2019m a full-on retard when it comes to sports. What\u2019s more, the reason Nasera is scouting me for the club is that I\u2019m human. Does she even care about my physical prowess? Would she change her mind when she sees my scrawny ass fail even to do more than ten push-ups?\n\n\u201cL-look, Nasera, I really appreciate you considering me good enough for the sports club\u2014\u201d \n\nBefore I can continue with my words, Nasera\u2019s expression deflates, and she takes a step back. \u201cOh... you\u2019re declining\u2026 O-okay\u2026\u201d she says as her expression takes on a defeated, almost hurt tone. \u201cI\u2026 I understand your decision, Anon\u2026\u201d She lets out a sigh, bites her lower lip, and closes her eyes. \u201cI guess I was a bit too naive to think that you\u2019d be interested in the club, especially since you\u2019ve only been in attendance a week\u2026\u201d the ptero opens her eyes again and looks deep into me with her radiant amber orbs. \u201cIf you really don\u2019t want to be a part of\u2026 my club\u2026 I fully respect your decision\u2026\u201d She reaches out to grab the flyer off my hands. As she does, I can see the absolute devastation in her eyes. She almost looks ready to jump into her bed and cry herself to sleep\u2026 \n\nOh goddammit. I\u2019m going to hate myself for this later.\n\nI yank away the flyer before Nasera can take it from me, causing her to look at me with a surprised expression. \n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t let me finish my words,\u201d I say, all the while clearing my throat and smiling in the best faux way that I can. \u201cWhat I was about to say was\u2026\u201d I clear my throat before continuing. \u201cI appreciate you considering me good enough for the sports club. I\u2019d be happy to become a part of it and help you make Volcano High history.\u201d\n\nNasera\u2019s expression does a one-eighty. Whereas she looked miserable and defeated before, she now looks ready to jump over the moon. She lets out an adorable squeal as she flutters both her good wing and her smaller damaged one with what I assume is excitement. I\u2019m not sure since I\u2019m not versed in the finer physical tells that dinos did with one another. Still, judging by the simper on her lips, I\u2019m more than sure that she\u2019s experiencing a moment of absolute rapture.\n\n\u201cOh, this is great news, Anon!\u201d Nasera says as she grabs both my hands into her solid yet gentle grasp. \u201cYou won\u2019t regret your decision. Why, by the time we graduate, you\u2019ll be more than ready to face any athletic challenge the world can toss in your direction. You might not even need to rely on crude tools to get certain tasks done with the muscles you\u2019ll have!\u201d\n\nDespite Nasera\u2019s comment once again being on the mildly racist side, I don\u2019t say anything to the ptero now holding my hands and smiling like she won some kind of lotery. Part of it is because I don\u2019t want to ruin the moment for her, as it's clear that me joining her club means a lot, but the other part is fear over what I had gotten myself into.\n\nNasera stops sperging out and clears her throat, letting go of my hands and giving me a cool and collected look that didn\u2019t quite match with the excitement she displayed moments earlier.\n\n\u201cOkay. Since you\u2019re officially joining my club, that means that there\u2019ll be some paperwork to fill out. Oh, and I\u2019m definitely going to need your measurements for your club uniform. I\u2019ll take your shoe size while I\u2019m at it too. Good shoes go a long way towards making someone a good athlete!\u201d Nasera reaches into her pocket and pulls out her phone. \u201cHere, let\u2019s exchange numbers so I can keep you posted on how the paperwork goes. You can text me your measurements too while we\u2019re at it.\u201d\n\nI freeze up completely.\n\nRED ALERT!\n\nA CUTE GIRL WANTS YOUR NUMBER!\n\nI can feel the spaghetti pouring out of my pockets as I reach for my phone. In the same move, I tap out the password and hand the device over to Nasera, who looks at me with a raised eyebrow smile at first before giggling. \n\nThe cute ptero wastes no time taking my phone into her hands, tapping away at it so fast that I\u2019m left stunned. Then, to my surprise, she takes a selfie of herself before tossing the phone back to me. I have enough cognitive power to catch it, at which point I take a look at the number now saved into the device\u2019s memory, complete with a picture of Nasera giving me a peppy toothy smile and a peace sign.\n\nBe still, my fucking heart\u2026\n\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Nasera starts, snapping me out of my stupor. \u201cAre you going to send me your measurements, or...?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d I drone out before my brain finally manages to unfuck itself. \u201cOh yeah, measurements!\u201d I repeat in a daze as I type out my clothes size, as well as my shoe size. Seconds later, Nasera\u2019s phone lets out a beep, and she looks at my message with a bit more interest than I would have expected.\n\nNasera lets out a whistle as she reads over my text. \u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t expect you to be so burly.\u201d She gives my body a once-over, the grin on her lips never once faltering. \u201cShould\u2019ve expected that in hindsight, though, what with you being a caveman and whatnot.\u201d\n\nI raise an eyebrow at that comment. \u201cHumans don\u2019t live in caves anymore. Plenty of good houses and apartments\u2026 and stuff...\u201d I say casually to Nasera\u2019s quip about my species. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s lived in caves for at least a couple thousand years...\u201d\n\nNasera\u2019s cheeks turn a shade of red as she puts a hand to her lips. \u201cOh. You\u2019re absolutely right!\u201d She puts on an apologetic smile and bows slightly. \u201cSorry! I\u2019m not really used to dealing with skinnies and their\u2014'' She cuts herself off and again puts a hand to her lips, only this time her cheeks puff as she puts on a pout. \u201cDammit, I repeated the word!\u201d she shouts before letting out a sigh and putting her phone away. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 go and talk to Naomi and get all the paperwork sorted out and ready. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll see you later\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore I can say another word to Nasera, she power walks down the hallway. As she does, I can\u2019t help but notice her reddening face as she does her best to maintain some kind of composure. \n\nI watch her go, not quite sure what to make of the whole situation. Not that my mind\u2019s working correctly at that moment. If anything, I was still struggling to comprehend what had taken place. \n\nSomehow, someway, I wound up not only joining a club I have absolutely no business being a part of, but I also wound up scoring the number of said club\u2019s president\u2026 who also happened to be one of the prettiest girls in the entire school.\n\nI end up leaning against the nearest wall, not quite sure how to proceed ahead.\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d I say to no one in particular. \u201cHow the hell am I going to get out of this one\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\nMy thoughts don\u2019t get any better as the day progresses. If anything, I feel even worse as I interact with all the familiar faces I\u2019ve somehow become acquainted with despite my original desire to blend into the background and disappear. Trish still gives me the usual shit during math class while Reeda\u2014bless her soul\u2014remains as helpful as ever. Meanwhile, Fang continues to be that icy bitch during science class. Her bitchiness seems double the norm today, no doubt in response to Nasera\u2019s sudden interest in me. While all the above happens, Nasera keeps tailing me wherever possible, no doubt in an attempt to further \u2018seal the deal\u2019 as far me joining her club goes.\n\nNasera\u2026 that\u2019s where the root of all my mental anguish currently lies\u2026\n\nWhy did I say yes to joining her club? Was it only because of her pretty face and not because I want to improve myself physically or be sporty? Granted, she\u2019s an absolute knockout of a woman, so far out of my league that the fact that I\u2019m even speaking to her feels like some kind of cosmic fluke. Someone as pretty, talented, and famous as her has no business even acknowledging that I exist, let alone asking me to join her club all of a sudden\u2026\n\nNasera sees the new human student and thinks to herself, \u2018oh hey, I know how I can get a good laugh out of the new guy. Invite him to my club and watch him fail at everything!\u2019 \n\nI mean, this has to be some kind of prank, right? After all, I\u2019m the guy you pick if you want to sabotage a team!\n\nYeah, that has to be it. Naresa\u2019s doing the whole \u2018set up\u2019 plan I\u2019ve seen countless times in anime. She\u2019s acting all friendly and kind so that I let my guard down, exploiting the fact that I\u2019m all goo-goo for her looks and talent, stringing me along, making me think that I have an actual shot with her only to then pull the rug from under me so that I fall face-first into a pile of tar and feathers. Cue the laughs from everyone in school and the eternal humiliation that\u2019ll follow me for the rest of my existence in Volcaldera Bluffs.\n\nFuck. It\u2019s like in Rock Bottom all over again\u2026\n\nI can see it now, my every attempt at trying to do sports failing miserably. Trying to lift weights only to have some of them fall on my foot. Trying to participate in the hundred-meter dash only to fall face-first into the dirt right at the starting line. Attempting to perform some hanging gymnastic rings only to get somehow the things wrapped around my neck, resulting in a live strangulation\u2026 all the while every student in Volcano High points and laughs at me; laugh harder than they\u2019ve ever laughed before. Laugh harder than they even laughed at Fang and her band during that botched concert on my first day of school\u2026\n\nAs school finally finishes and I start my trek home, the horrible thoughts continue to hound me. The laughter of my peers mercilessly tears at what little confidence I have, reminding me that I\u2019m not worth a single god-damned thing no matter how hard I try.\n\nHarsh\u2026 maybe too harsh even for me, even if it's true\u2026\n\nThe walk from the bus stop to my shitty apartment does take my mind off of the terrible thoughts for a bit, if only because I need my full attention to survive the streets of Skin Row. The moment I set foot in my apartment, though, almost an hour\u2019s worth of repressed horrors flood right back to the forefront of my mind and begin to overwhelm me, making me feel like I\u2019m about to go insane from something that hasn\u2019t happened or even has a chance of happening... \n\nI jump on my shitty laptop and try to distract myself with my favorite pastime, but even shitposting doesn\u2019t seem to help ease my mind. Worse, it\u2019s affecting my efforts to troll and grief. Some of my posts even come off as helpful and insightful\u2026 \n\nI shut off my laptop and decide to call it a night. Maybe what I need to help clear my mind is a good night\u2019s sleep. It has been a long day, and perhaps I\u2019m just delirious from the fatigue...\n\nOf course, no sooner I close my eyes, the images that have been hounding me all day long return more vivid than ever before. Nightmare after nightmare assaults my senses, each one showcasing my many possible failures clearly and brutally. And the laughter, that fucking hellish laughter threatening to drive me over the edge\u2026\n\nI try shouting at first. When that fails, I start thrashing about in desperation. When that fails, I break down and beg for the ridicule to stop. That only makes the laughs grow all the harsher. I start to shut myself off, accepting the fact that I\u2019m a failure at everything I do and will ever do.\n\nAnon Y. Mous, failure and pariah of Rock Bottom, soon to be the biggest failure and pariah of Volcano High. A man without a present or a future, with only the shittiest of shit pasts to comfort him at night.\n\nFuck me. This shit\u2019s downright depressing...\n\nBut something happens that I don\u2019t expect. Little by little, the laughter begins to lessen, and my failures become less and less catastrophic. Then Nasera makes her appearance known, her beauty as radiant\u2014if not more so\u2014than I remember.\n\nAt first, I believe she\u2019s come to hammer in that final nail in the coffin. No doubt she\u2019s here to bear witness to her handiwork coming into fruition. I mean, how can she not be here to bask in the afterglow of her success?\n\nIf only that were the case. It would be so much easier to accept. It would be so much easier to believe that Nasera\u2019s the new bad guy in my life, but of course, it\u2019s not that simple. \n\nNothing ever is\u2026\n\nRather than mocking me for my failures, Nasera begins helping me. She coos compliments when I\u2019m at my lowest, firmly yet patiently corrects my mistakes in posture and technique, and cheerfully encourages my successes, no matter how tiny and insignificant they are in the grand scheme of things. Her voice holds no mockery, and her marvelously shining amber eyes only look on with kindness and the utmost respect. It fills me with a confidence I didn\u2019t even know I had in me, reassuring me that no matter what I do in life, I was someone that meant a damn, and not just a nobody floating through life at the whims of a cruel, cold world\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t understand you,\u201d I whisper to Nasera.\n\nThe beautiful one-winged ptero only gives me a warm smile as she grabs my hands.\n\n\u201cAnon\u2026 please know that\u2026 I believe in you. So don\u2019t be discouraged. Things are tough, but you\u2019ll make sense of them. I know you will\u2026\u201d\n\nNasera\u2019s eyes glow warmer, and her simper only grows all the more comforting.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve endured so much\u2026 You don\u2019t have to fight so hard anymore, okay? I know that you\u2019ll make something amazing of yourself. You just have to believe in yourself. And if you can\u2019t, then believe in me. Believe in the me who believes in the you\u2026 who believes in yourself...\u201d \n\nNasera confuses me to no end. A part of me wants to think she\u2019s only using me for her ulterior motives, yet another knows that\u2019s bullshit. In the short time I\u2019ve known the youngest of the Aaran siblings, she\u2019s been nothing but kind, helpful, and cheerful. She\u2019s guided me far longer than anyone else would have and has done everything in her power to make sure I feel welcome and secure in Volcano High. What\u2019s more, she\u2019s extended her hand in friendship, something absolutely no one else in my life has ever done...\n\nI snap awake as the alarm on my bedside shrieks its alarm. As I rise from bed, some of the memories of my dream remain. I feel a sense of dread coming from some of those memories, but I also sense a great deal of hope... \n\nAlmost as if things are going to be okay for once in my fucked-up life...","Title":"Altered Paths - Nasera","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Nasera and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Rangto","Summary":"In an alternate universe not that different from the one you know, Anon decides to join his new High School's sports clubs after its president, the beautiful and outgoing Nasera, convinces him to.

Are you back for more of this story? How interesting. How very, very interesting\u2026\n\nWell, regardless, since you came back, Might as well continue telling this tale \n\nLucky for you, not much has happened since you last saw this reality. \n\nAfter waking up from his nightmares, Anon went about another normal day of school. He saw his classmates as expected, and interacted with the girl that\u2019s been causing him no end of confusion up till now. On top of that, he endured Trish\u2019s grilling over what he and Nasera did the day prior when she led him down the hall, got his usual set of math answers from a still helpful Reeda, survived his science class and the sharp glares of an annoyed Fang, and generally made it through the rest of the day without further incident.\n\nAll in all, it seemed as if the rest of the week would go by uneventully, almost making the human believe that he had imagined the whole interaction with Nasera about the sports club. That knowledge was still a bit spot of confusion for the petite caveman. But can you blame him? It\u2019s not every day that one of the most beautiful girls in school comes to you and asks you to join her club. \n\nIf only Anon knew what was in store for him\u2026\n\nWell, I\u2019ve talked your ears enough as is. Why don\u2019t we pick up this story in real-time?\n\n \n\nThursday Morning...\n\nMy phone\u2019s sudden ring knocks right out of my slumber, almost causing me to roll over to the floor. \n\nAnd I was having such a wonderful dream. \n\nTrying to think back on the details of the dream leaves me with a bit of a blank mind. Fuck, waking up jumbled my memory. Still, it had to have been a nice dream due to the warm fuzzy feeling I still feel in my chest.\n\nI try to ignore my phone\u2019s ringing as best as I can. When it finally ceases, I adjust myself back into bed and prepare to go back to sleep. \u2018Probably some fucking telemarketer,\u2019 I think as I shut my eyes and get as comfy as I can.\n\nThen the phone rings once more, forcing my eyes open yet again. \n\nWith a groan, I sit on the edge of my bed and snatch the phone from my nightstand. I let out an angry sigh and tap the answer button without looking at the caller ID, ready to curse out whoever was daring to wake me at such an early hour of the day.\n\n\u201cLook, whatever you\u2019re selling, I\u2019m not interested in it, especially this early in the morning!\u201d I snap, ready to hang the call, when a familiar tone laughs from the other end of the line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid to ask how often you get marketer calls if that\u2019s how you answer your phone,\u201d Nasera states in a far too cheerful tone for how early in the day it is. \u201cRegardless, this is your wake-up call. Rise and shine, Mr. Mous. Rise and shine!\u201d \n\nI look over to the old and beat-up alarm clock next to my bed. Its red LED display reads that it\u2019s a minute past five in the morning.\n\nFIVE IN THE FUCKING MORNING!\n\n\u201cNasera\u2026 it\u2019s five in the morning. Why are you calling me this early?\u201d A better question would be why she\u2019s even calling a loser like me at all, but then I remember that Nasera doesn\u2019t seem to follow the norms of a school system. You know, the system where the loser nobodies stay in the bottom and get trampled on by the popular perfect paragons of society. I was the loser, of course, and Nasera was the paragon. \n\nThe fact alone that she even acknowledged my existence baffled my mind to no end\u2026\n\n\u201cOh, I know it\u2019s five!\u201d Nasera chirps in a too excited tone. \u201cAnd you should be thankful too. I let you sleep an extra hour!\u201d\n\n\u2018She let me sleep in an hour?\u2019 I muse, my brain incapable of understanding how someone could wake up at such early hours. I\u2019m so baffled that I almost miss Nasera\u2019s following words.\n\n\u201cHumans are diurnal, right? Don\u2019t you guys get up at the crack of dawn to get in a good day\u2019s hunt and gathering, or am I confusing it with nocturnalism?\u201d  \n\n\u2018W...what?\u2019 I think, not quite sure what to make of Nasera\u2019s comment. \n\nOn the one hand, she\u2019s right about humans and daytime activity. On the other hand, why is she even bringing it up in the first place? Also, hunting and gathering? That doesn\u2019t make any sense...\n\nA part of me is very tempted to snap back at Nasera with facts to correct her ignorant views on humans, but then I remember that she\u2019s not exactly an expert when it comes to human-dino interactions to begin with. I don\u2019t think anyone in Volcaldera Bluffs is.\n\nI let out a sigh and eat it for now. \u201cYes, humans are daytime active,\u201d I confirm with Nasera, biting a tongue that wants to add a \u2018but\u2019 to that statement. \u201cStill doesn\u2019t change the fact that we don\u2019t wake up before the sun\u2019s even risen over the horizon!\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, quit your whining, Anon. It\u2019s not winter yet, so you have no excuse to hibernate,\u201d Nasera snaps with a bit of annoyance in her tone. \u201cYou\u2019re part of the sports club. That means you have to be an early bird from now on. You know, like in the old saying? The early bird catches the\u2014crap, what was it again? Something about a bug?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, you mean \u2018worm\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! Worm!\u201d Nasera confirms. \u201cEarly birds get the worms!\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll start getting ready,\u201d I say once again, readying myself to end the call and start the longest morning of my life so far.\n\n\u201cWonderful! I should be there to pick you up in fourteen minutes!\u201d \n\nNasera\u2019s words dispel the last of my grogginess and almost make me jump out of bed.\n\n\u201cW-WHAT!?\u201d I end up shouting loud enough that I\u2019m sure the upstairs tenants got jolted awake themselves.\n\n\u201cGeez, don\u2019t shout my earholes out, Anon,\u201d Nasera says with some hints of annoyance. \u201cI said that I\u2019d be there to pick you up in fifteen minutes,\u201d she repeats with a surprising amount of patience in her voice.\n\n\u201cH-how?\u201d I stammer out, not caring if I sound like I\u2019m having some kind of aneurysm.\n\n\u201cI have a car,\u201d Nasera says flatly, though with a few hints of amusement in her tone. \u201cYou know, a mechanical carriage that has wheels\u2014which I\u2019m sure your people invented way back in the day\u2014 and uses fuel to get people places in a hurry? Can blow up if mishandled too much?\u201d\n\nI again fight the urge to snap at Nasera for her oh-so-casual belittlement of my intellect and instead focus on the main thing she\u2019s trying to tell me. \n\nFor some ungodly reason, Volcano High\u2019s paragon of sporty perfection is coming over to my place, of her own accord, to pick my ass up and take me to school, at dawn of all times...\n\nMy brain\u2019s about to bluescreen trying to take in all the information I\u2019m trying to process at the same time. \n\nI almost end up missing Nasera\u2019s following words.\n\n\u201cAnon? Did you hear me? I said to please try to be ready in fifteen. I don\u2019t want to stick around Skin Row and risk getting mugged, shanked, dino-napped, or all three at the same time.\u201d\n\nI blink and shake my head to try and dispel the stupid as I find myself agreeing with Nasera on her fears about Skin Row. My neighborhood isn\u2019t the best place for a hot chick like her to hang around.\n\n\u201cSo hurry up! Because if something happens to me, my dad\u2019s going to mount your head on his trophy wall, and I\u2019d very much hate having to live with that on my conscience.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, I hang up the call and kick myself out of bed. I can hardly believe what I got done hearing. I pinch myself to ensure I\u2019m not having another dream like the one I had a day ago. When I fail to snap awake in a sweat again, I realize that I\u2019m not dreaming, and that the situation unfolding before me is very, very real.\n\nA girl is coming over to my place. A hot girl. A REALLY hot girl who\u2019s also the president of the sports club; a club I joined two days earlier\u2026\n\nWasting no more time on idle thoughts, I peel off and hit the shower first. I don\u2019t even bother using much soap since I have very little body. I spend less than five minutes washing before I\u2019m flying right out and putting on my usual jeans, worn-out casual shoes, white shirt, and green linen shirt. I stuff my phone into my pocket and shove all my books and other school materials into my backpack without caring how they wind up inside. I\u2019ll worry about organizing my crap when I\u2019m not on the clock. I then run to my kitchen and reach for the most portable food I can get my hands on, that being two paltry and almost tasteless granola bars. Kind of wish I could have a bigger breakfast, but I get the feeling that even cereal\u2019s something I can\u2019t finish in less than five minutes.\n\nJust as I finish stuffing the last of the granola into my gullet, my phone buzzes. I reach into my pocket and pull out the device, looking over at the new message that got sent to me:\n\n \n\n[Nasera]\n\nOutside. \n\nHurry plz. \n\nPlace gives me the creeps!\n\n \n\nI sling my backpack over my shoulder and rush out of my apartment, making sure to lock up the place nice and tight before flying down the stairs and out into the cold and dark morning air. As I do, I can\u2019t help but ask myself a few questions about my current situation. \n\nHow did I get here? Was someone playing some kind of joke on me? How does Nasera know where I live? \n\nMemories of my old life back in Rock Bottom and the doxing incident come to mind. Did someone leak my new address? Do I have to transfer schools again?\n\nFuck. I hate feeling so out of the loop here. Have to ask Nasera what the hell\u2019s going on as soon as I see her...\n\nThe instant I step out of my apartment building, I\u2019m greeted by my future club president, who waves me over to what I assume is her car, though I have to do a double-take because it doesn\u2019t look like something she\u2019d be driving in the first place.\n\nNasera\u2019s ride looks to be some kind of muscle car. It has that whole \u2018high schooler trying to show off\u2019 vibe going for it, yet at the same time, it also looks to be far more functional than showy. Yet, the one aspect that sticks out to me the most is that the vehicle has this horizontal split in the middle. One half looks pristine\u2014right out of the dealership even\u2014while the other half looks disheveled and worn, paint chipping in some parts, and with a small crack near the driver\u2019s side of the windshield.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a unique style. I wonder for a second if its on purpose... \n\nI take one final look at Nasera\u2019s car before rushing forward, opening the door, and taking my seat in the passenger side. As I do, I can\u2019t help but feel uneasy. Here I am getting into the car of someone I had befriended a little over a week ago. Said person I had befriended also happened to be among the top most attractive people in all Volcano High. The only other girl that came close to matching Nasera\u2019s natural beauty was that Stacey girl, and she was head cheerleader.\n\nOh god. Since I\u2019m going to be doing the whole sports thing, I\u2019m going to be seeing a hell of a lot more of Stacey too, aren't I? \u2018Fuck. I\u2019m going to be spilling spaghetti everywhere I go...\u2019\n\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Nasera says, snapping me out of my thoughts. \u201cSpaghetti is a good source of carbs, but I think it\u2019s too early to be thinking about eating it. That\u2019s more of a lunch and dinner meal!.\u201d\n\nFuck. Mumbling. Have to keep a lid on that shit from now on\u2026\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Nasera says as she pulls away from the curb and gets the car rolling. \u201cGood morning! Hope you slept well last night!\u201d\n\nAlmost as if on cue, I let out a yawn, cutting off whatever words I had planned on saying. Not my intended message, but the act still got across how early I felt it was.\n\nNasera rolls her eyes and puts on a warm simper. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard at first, but you\u2019ll get used to this schedule soon enough. Though I do suggest you hit the hay at least two hours earlier from now on. Gotta make sure you get at least seven hours of sleep. Or was it eight?\u201d She taps a finger on her chin in contemplation. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure seven to eight hours is more than enough for most humans!\u201d The ptero cheers in too sugary a voice for me to think it one-hundred percent earnest. \n\nI roll my eyes at Nasera\u2019s suggestion. \u2018Sleep two hours earlier? But that means I\u2019ll miss out on prime shitposting time. How am I supposed to get all those (you)s if I\u2019m dozing off while everyone gets online?\u2019 I think to myself in a bit of annoyance.\n\nNasera lets out a small chuckle, almost as if in reply to my thoughts. \u201cThere\u2019s that word again. \u2018Shitposting.\u2019 I still don\u2019t know what it means, but it sounds\u2026 interesting...\u201d\n\nMy cheeks burn a bit as I again berate myself for not keeping my mumbling in check. Thinking fast, I let out a chuckle of my own and try to play the situation cool as ice. \u201cYeah\u2026 it\u2019s not that important. I\u2019ll\u2026 explain it later. Much, much later\u2026\u201d Yeah, so much later, in fact, that it\u2019ll probably be around the time of the heat-death of the universe...\n\nSoon enough, I notice a change in the surrounding buildings. Gone are the commie-style public housing blocks or the dilapidated buildings speaking of years of neglect and general urban decay. We pass by some industrial zones, and soon enough, it feels like we are in the suburbs, the housing getting fancier with each street we drive through.\n\nNasera lets out a huge sigh. She seems to lose some of the tension in her body as she lets herself slump a bit on her seat. \u201cFinally, we\u2019re out of that shithole,\u201d she says in a harsh tone that, if I\u2019m being honest, does not befit the ptero one bit. \n\n\u201cNo offense, Anon, but your neighborhood\u2019s... crappy. The worst place to live in all Volcaldera. Though, it explains why you have to rely on the school\u2019s lunch card...\u201d\n\nOkay, that one feels like a straight-up slap to the face. I almost lose the fight keeping my emotions and the comments that come with them bottled up. Nasera\u2019s words sting all the harder because I know she\u2019s right, and that fact makes me feel all the more embarrassed about my living situation. Not like I have a choice in the matter. My whole move to Volcaldera was a last-minute thing, and I\u2019m sure it only happened because Spears pulled some kind of convoluted paperwork loophole. Not to mention that I was never well-off to start. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason my hometown\u2019s called \u2018Rock Bottom...\u2019\n\nI let go of whatever resentment is bubbling in me, as well as my desire to educate the dino driving me to school as I instead focus on a much more important question, one that NEEDS answering\u2026\n\n\u201cNasera,\u201d I start, keeping my tone as deadpan as I can despite the maelstrom of emotions raging within me. \u201cHow and why do you know my home address?\u201d \n\nNasera puts on a big broad grin as if she\u2019s pretty proud of some accomplishment. \u201cI memorized it from your forms while Naomi and Principal Spears finalized your paperwork!\u201d she chirps out her answer innocently enough. Not sure if that puts me at ease or makes me feel all the more uneasy. I\u2019m pretty sure that what Nasera did counts as a violation of privacy laws.\n\nBefore I can voice my displeasure over the mild level of doxing on her part, Nasera\u2019s expression grows serious. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Anon. I shouldn\u2019t have access to this information. That it must be some kind of violation of your privacy.\u201d\n\nD-did I mumble again? Is Nasera reading my mind!?\n\n\u201cRest assured, I\u2019m only allowed to know such personal information because I\u2019m the president of the sports club. Your address and medical records are crucial info for me to have on hand in case of an emergency.\u201d\n\nSee, I can understand having my medical information on hand. Sports are taxing and dangerous. But my address too? What does that have to do with it?\n\n\u201cI understand your concern over me knowing something so personal, but I can assure you that the only people who know this info right now are myself, Naomi, and Principal Spears.\u201d\n\nPrincipal Spears knowing my address makes total sense. He\u2019s the principal of Volcano High, after all. But Naomi? Why does she have to know that? Fuck, being class president comes with some unspoken perks, doesn\u2019t it? \n\nThat\u2019s still total bullshit. But well, whatever. At least only three people know that I live in absolute squalor. That\u2019s at least a hell of a lot less than back in Rock Bottom.\n\nI try looking at the positives of my current situation. Nasera seems like she\u2019s professional enough to keep her mouth shut about my living conditions. It\u2019s embarrassing as hell, but she\u2019s at least not Trish, who I know for a fact would LOVE to run her mouth about how I live one step away from literal homelessness. \n\nNaomi, despite how annoying she can be with her sugary disposition that I know for a fact is a front for something shady, also seems to be a professional. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be the class president. They don\u2019t give that job out to anyone.  \n\nAside from that, there\u2019s also the fact that I\u2019m getting a free lift to School. Sure, I had to get up almost two hours earlier than usual, but this beats having to haul my ass four miles through Skin row to get to a proper bus station. \n\nThat did bring up an important question, though. If Nasera wants me to get up so early from now on, does that mean I\u2019d have to walk through Skin Row at such early hours of the morning? Wouldn\u2019t that be as bad as walking through those forsaken streets at night?\n\nFuck. Just when I thought I could coast by without having to carry a knife on my person\u2026\n\nI divert those thoughts away by asking myself what we\u2019d be doing so early in school. Obviously, it's going to be something sports-related, but what exactly? Was it considered a meeting? Were there going to be other people already waiting there for us too?\n\nA very jerky turn of the car derails all my thoughts and makes me realize that, holy shit, Nasera\u2019s flying through the streets at almost sixty miles an hour! I\u2019m sure I make some kind of sound because the one-winted ptero lets out a satisfied giggle.\n\n\u201cAh, I love driving around town early in the morning!\u201d she exclaims as she makes yet another sharp turn, which makes my stomach lurch a bit from the suddenness. \u201cNo traffic, no pedestrians, and all the lights seem to be green. Really lets me cut loose and drive without any worries!\u201d\n\n\u2018Yeah\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure traffic laws aren\u2019t a suggestion, Nasera,\u2019 I end up thinking but not voicing as intended. Though, with my mumbling problem, I\u2019m pretty sure I end up saying it out loud anyway. Nasera gives no response though, so I assume she\u2019s too engrossed with her driving that\u2019s just one level shy of being something out of a stock car race to care... \n\nOne benefit of Nasera\u2019s speedy and reckless disregard of most road laws short of vehicular man\/dino slaughter is that it only takes her fifteen minutes to reach Volcano High. That has to be some kind of record. \n\nThe first thing I notice as Nasera parks her car in the back of the school is how the sun\u2019s nothing more than a few rays of gold on the horizon that barely peek past the mountainous terrain of Dinofornia. The second thing is how eerily empty the school appears so early in the day. If I had once thought the school looked like something out of a Doom wad during the day, the pre-sunrise darkness made it appear like something straight out of Silent Hill. \n\nNow that\u2019s a thought that\u2019s rather horrible to consider, getting stuck in a school while some horror-type shit happens. Would make for a great story though. Didn't I read something similar not that long ago? \n\nNasera and I disembark without a word. I\u2019m not even outside my captain\u2019s car for more than a second before she taps me in the shoulder and motions me to follow. I do, and she leads me into the backmost part of the school, right where the fields and the gym are.\n\nWe stop in front of the gym building, but rather than going through the main entrance, Nasera leads me to the side of the building, right up to a door I assumed led to some kind of supply closet. Before I\u2019m even able to ask her how she plans to get the door open, she reaches for her keys and picks out a worn, nondescript one from the few she has on her key ring, which she then uses to open the door without any real issues.\n\nI have to remind myself that she has those keys because of her position as captain of the sports club.\n\nOnce more, Nasera motions for me to follow her. I do so cautiously. Maybe it\u2019s my paranoid side talking, but it kind of feels like I\u2019m walking into some kind of trap, and I\u2019m about to get knocked out before some insidious school cult harvests my organs. Of course, when the lights come on, I\u2019m only met with an empty hall. \n\nMe and my silly fears. I really do watch too much fucking anime...\n\nWe walk a bit more, and then we finally exit into the gymnasium proper. And I can\u2019t help but be impressed. Rock Bottom High\u2019s gymnasium has nothing on Volcano High\u2019s. The court looks so well-maintained and shiny that I can almost see my reflection on it, and the benches look state of the art. They even have cushions on them, ensuring maximum comfort for any spectators. What\u2019s more, the gym\u2019s so large that it feels as if it houses two entire courts instead of one.\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t get too distracted now,\u201d Nasera tells me, likely taking notice of me ogling my surroundings. She instead once again motions for me to follow. By now, I\u2019m not sure where else the ptero can be leading me. I get an answer soon enough when she holds open another door at the other end of the gym, leading into yet another hallway, one that I recognize this time, as it\u2019s the route leading to the boys and girls locker rooms. Our destination is neither, as she leads me further down the hall, towards what I recognize as one of the offices.\n\nNasera again uses her key to open the door to that office space, the light flicking active as soon as she takes a single step inside. I follow Nasera in. As I do, the first thing that strikes me is the fact that the office is quite messy. There are papers strewn over the table, and sports equipment lies haphazardly placed in shelves and racks. There appears to be some kind of ball pile in a far corner, and for some strange reason that eludes me altogether, the King Rex costume hangs on the wall, waiting for someone to don him and bring merriment to all students and staff alike.\n\nNow that I give it some thought, Volcano High having a dinosaur for a mascot is like Rock Bottom High having a caveman for a mascot\u2026\n\n\u201cSorry about the mess,\u201d Nasera apologizes, snapping me out of whatever train of thoughts I was having. \u201cI haven\u2019t had much time to clean up last semester\u2019s mess.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t mind the mess too much. If anything, it kinda reminds me of my old room back in Rock Bottom. If nothing else, it brings a tiny bit of nostalgia to me, making my current situation not feel as strange as it would otherwise be.\n\n\u201cI have something for you. Hold on a sec!\u201d Nasera announces as she walks into what looks like a supply room in the back of the office. Seconds later, the ptero comes out holding what appears to be a tracksuit, one that\u2019s colored white and red. On top of the folded clothes are a pair of sturdy high-top running shoes, also colored red and white, though more on the red side.\n\nNasera hands me the clothes and shoes, all the while smiling. \u201cTook me all yesterday, but I managed to find you some clothes fitting your exact measurements,\u201d she starts, all the while glowing with pride. \u201cHad to pay our school supplier a direct visit and wait for them to make your clothes from scratch. It turns out that they don\u2019t make outfits for non-dinos, so I guess you can consider your new digs completely custom!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m lost for words. \n\nOn the one hand, I can\u2019t help but feel a bit pampered by all the attention. Then again, if what Nasera told me is true, me being the first-ever human to join the sports club makes me pretty damn unique. At least unique enough that getting custom clothes isn\u2019t out of the question. I just find it difficult to accept everything...\n\n\u201cGo on, try \u2018em on!\u201d Nasera encourages, the smile on her lips not once wavering in its radiance.\n\nWith no way to come up with an excuse not to, I grip the clothes in my hands and head out of the office, down the hallway, and right into the boy\u2019s locker room. It doesn\u2019t take me long to find my assigned locker for PE class. \n\nOver the next five minutes, I input the code after double-checking the note I made for myself on my phone, put on my new digs while stuffing my old clothes into the locker, and slip on my new shoes, making sure the laces are tight, and the straps secure.\n\nI give myself a careful look over. As I do, I can\u2019t help but smile at how comfortable the new outfit feels on me. I don\u2019t know what kind of material the tailor used, but it sure as heck doesn\u2019t feel like your run-of-the-mill cotton. The fabric breathes far too well, and it\u2019s so smooth against my skin that it almost feels like I\u2019m not wearing anything at all. What\u2019s more, the new shoes are the most comfortable pair I\u2019ve ever worn. The soles are soft, the size is perfect, and the straps make them feel secure and airtight, almost feeling as if they somehow have become a part of my foot. \n\nThe new gear feels so lovely and so comfortable that I'm considering ditching my old outfit and making this my go-to from now on. Then I remember the outfit\u2019s only for club use, and some of my happiness evaporates. \n\nThat line of thought sobers me up, filling me with some of the doubts I\u2019ve been having since first agreeing to join the club. A part of me still wants to find some way to get out of it. But how can I when Nasera\u2019s so friendly and accommodating? She even got me brand new clothes for Raptor Jesus\u2019 sake. Would quitting also mean I have to pay for the new digs and shoes out of pocket? \n\nA Knock on the door to the locker room snaps me out of my thoughts. I stuff the last of my belongings into my locker and step outside. Soon as I do, Nasera greets me. She herself looks very different from a few minutes ago. Whereas before she was wearing her usual white shirt and tight red pants, she\u2019s now wearing what looks like a pair of super short and super tight volleyball shorts, a red and white varsity jacket with the school\u2019s logo emblazoned on the upper left side, a knee brace, and a red and white sweatband wrapped around her forehead.\n\nShe looks stunning. I\u2019m not going to lie...\n\n\u201cSo, how are the new clothes?\u201d Nasera asks.\n\n\u201cThey feel great!\u201d I reply with far more enthusiasm than I even expected to voice. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever worn something that feels so soft, breathes so well, yet feels so sturdy.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlad you like it,\u201d Nasera replies with a smile. \u201cOur school uniforms are made out of one-hundred percent Egyptian cotton!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a pretty fucking high percentage. It explains why it feels so good, though. It also answers my question about the price should I decide to quit the club later.\n\nOne more reason to stick around, I guess.\n\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d Nasera says as she grabs me by the shoulder and drags me down the hall and into a small kitchen area, one that looks almost like a teacher\u2019s lounge, except more sparse. Before asking my future club captain what we\u2019re doing in the kitchen, she walks up to one of the many counters and brings out a blender. She plugs the device on the nearest outlet and again turns to the counters. Seconds later, she brings out an almost comically large white tub full of some kind of white powder, which she sets on the countertop before moving to the nearby fridge and taking out a carton of almond milk and some pre-sliced fruit.\n\nOnce she has set all the ingredients on the counter, Nasera turns to face me. \u201cOne or two scoops?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how to answer whatever Nasera\u2019s asking me, so I end up saying the first thing that pops into my head. \u201cT-two scoops,\u201d I stammer out.\n\nNasera nods and smiles. \u201cFour scoops it is then!\u201d she proclaims before opening the tub of white powder and scooping out four pretty seizable cups of what I can only assume has to be some kind of protein powder. By the time\u2019s she\u2019s finished scooping, almost half of the blender\u2019s full of the stuff. She then proceeds to pour at least five cups of almond milk and the sliced fruit into the blender before closing the top and activating the device.\n\nWhile the blender works its magic on the ingredients, Nasera turns back to face me. \u201cYou\u2019ve already told me that you really like the new clothes. What about the shoes? Do they feel nice as well?\u201d\n\nI nod enthusiastically. \u201cShoes feel so great, I think I\u2019m going to use \u2018em as my new footwear from now on. It\u2019ll sure make getting to school so much easier in the mornings.\u201d\n\nNasera turns off the blender, all the while still keeping her eyes on me. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been walking to school this whole past week and a half?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot like I have a choice,\u201d I say, my mood souring a bit. \u201cGotta walk through Skin Row to take a proper bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t buses run in and around Skin Row too?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do, but they\u2019re pretty\u2026 dangerous. Most of the time, they\u2019re hobo hotels on wheels. If I took one, I\u2019d probably wind up getting mugged, shanked, kidnapped, or all the above at the same time.\u201d\n\nNasera blinks a few times, very clearly processing my words. \u201cHow far do you walk to take a bus then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 honestly never given it much thought, but it takes me about an hour to get from my apartment to a bus station that\u2019s safe and brings me across the street from Volcano High. According to my phone\u2019s pace keeper, I do about four miles an hour, so\u2026\u201d I give Nasera a nonchalant shrug. \u201cI guess I walk four miles every morning?\u201d\n\nNasera pours two cups of the protein shake she finished preparing. She then hands me a cup, her expression one I can only describe grim. \u201cWell... As captain of the Sports Club, I can't let my newest member risk his safety just to be a part of morning jogs!\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not that bad. Honestly. I just gotta be real careful where I walk and make sure I stay on the well-lit sides of the streets.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, that\u2019s the problem!\u201d Nasera exclaims, all the while her brow furrows. \u201cLike, did you know that despite only making up about twenty percent of Volcaldera Bluff\u2019s population, skinnies make up more than eighty percent of all reported crime, the majority coming from Skin Row and Little Troodon?\u201d The ptero shivers, not sure if in disgust or fear. \u201cAnd you live right in the middle of Skin Row!\u201d My future club captain looks me in the eye with what I can only describe as worried determination. \u201cThat crap ISN\u2019T going to fly with me! So from now on, I\u2019m picking you up from your apartment at five sharp!\u201d\n\nBefore I can form some kind of protest to Nasera\u2019s pretty ridiculous command, she raises a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear any \u2018buts.\u2019 Only \u2018yes ma'am.\u2019 Got it?\u201d\n\nI swallow hard and nod in reply. That seems to be a good enough Answer for Nasera, who gulps down her protein shake in one single swig before letting out a satisfied sigh. \u201cNow then. Since you say you\u2019ve already been walking four miles daily for the last week, I\u2019m going to start us off with a nice two-mile jog. Drink your shake and meet me on the field!\u201d\n\nBefore I can even form words on my tongue, Nasera walks past me, all the while smiling with a great deal of contentment. I can only stare at the ptero\u2019s hips sway with a hypnotizing allure, said allure amplified by her booty shorts. \n\nThe sight only makes the neurons in my brain start firing off enthusiastically\u2026\n\nTo keep my\u2026 primal thoughts in check, I chug down my protein shake. I expect the drink to taste like absolute shit. Instead, I taste what has to be best god-dam protein shake I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of drinking in my life. My joy at the taste is such that I can\u2019t help but compare it to some kind of elixir. \n\nI put down the now empty cut on the counter and rush out of the office and towards the field as Nasera instructed. As I get my legs moving, I can\u2019t help but feel a sudden rush of energy overtaking my body. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the protein shake or the sudden rush of endorphins at the sight of Nasera\u2019s hot bod, but something\u2019s filling me with energy, and it fucking feels amazing.  \n\nWhen I reach Nasera out on the field, I find her doing stretches. She stops the instant she sees me and smiles. \u201cOh hey, good timing! Wanna join me on the stretches?\u201d\n\nI pause in my tracks and think about what Nasera\u2019s asking me to do. I\u2019ve never done anything that\u2019s remotely physically demanding, so I know almost shit when it comes to doing proper stretches. Something tells me that if I refuse, my muscles are going to make me regret the decision.\n\nI stand next to Nasera and begin trying mirror her movements. Unfortunately, my inexperience gets the better of me me, and I pull too hard in places and wind up giving myself cramps. I fall over, barely keeping myself from shouting out in pain. \n\nThankfully, Nasera is there to stretch my leg out, which makes the worst of the pain vanish. She then helps me back up and gives me a raised eyebrow look. \u201cYou\u2026 uh\u2026 want me to teach you some proper stretching techniques?\u201d\n\nAlready feeling my face grow warm from that particular embarrassment and fearing that if I try again, I\u2019m going to give myself another cramp, I nod in reply.\n\nThankfully, Nasera doesn\u2019t laugh in my face as she should. She only giggles a bit as she begins to patiently guide me through proper stretching techniques, many of which I hadn\u2019t ever seen until now. After ten minutes, we both finish the warm-ups, and it makes me feel so much more limber than before. \n\nHow the hell had I gone so long in my life without doing proper stretches?\n\nWith the stretches out of the way, Nasera tosses me a bottle of water before giving me a quick rundown on some jogging techniques. I listen as she explains how I have to inhale through my nose and never through my mouth, how I should only take small sips of water when thirsty and never drink more than that while jogging less I make myself sick, how I have to make sure the ball of my feet and the toes aren\u2019t parallel when my foot hits the ground, how I have to keep my posture upright at all times and always keep my eyes ahead, and of course that I shouldn\u2019t slouch or less lose a lot of stamina.\n\nQuite a lot to keep in mind for something so simple looking as jogging. Then again, very few things in life are simple if you stop to think about it\u2026\n\n\u201cOh, and one more thing,\u201d Nasera says as she takes her position on the field. \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to slow down if you feel you\u2019re running out of stamina. Better to set a slower pace than stopping altogether.\u201d\n\nI nod and walk out to the field myself. For the first time this morning, I feel like I\u2019m ready to make the most out of something fitness-related.\n\nThat\u2019s a very odd thing for me to think now that I stop to ponder it. It almost feels like some doppelganger is replacing me. Who am I, and what have I done with the real Anon?  \n\nIgnoring that last stupid thought, I give Nasera another smile and a nod of confirmation. She brings out her phone and activates the jogging app on it. \u201cWe\u2019re going for two miles. If we can keep up a pace of four miles an hour, we should finish in about twenty or so minutes. Maybe less.\u201d She puts her phone back into the pocket of her jacket and looks me in the eye. \u201cReady to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d I say a bit absentmindedly as, for the first time since meeting Nasera, I notice how beautiful her amber-toned eyes are\u2026\n\n\u201cThen GO!\u201d Nasera announces as she takes off jogging.\n\nBy the time my brain can process the event, Nasera\u2019s already a good dozen feet ahead and only getting further. \n\nWasting not another second, I order my legs to start moving, and in less than a second, I too am jogging right behind my club captain.\n\nEven though I give it my best, my jogging speed isn\u2019t up to par with Nasera\u2019s. Unless I start sprinting, I\u2019m destined to keep at least a good dozen feet away from the ptero, who seems to enter into a trance as her breathing evens out with her footfalls, creating a level of synchronicity that makes her every move as efficient as it is mesmerizing.\n\nIf I weren\u2019t actively jogging myself, I would have sat down on the bench to stare in absolute awe at Nasera\u2019s physical prowess...\n\n \n\nThe rays of sunlight hit my eyes the instant that ball of burning gas peeks over the mountains. With the light comes the warmth, and with the heat comes more sweat. I still haven\u2019t gotten used to the temperature shifts in Volcaldera Bluffs. It\u2019s not like back home, where the high altitude and mountainous terrain meant it was cool most of the time, if not outright freezing. \n\nNasera long finished running her two miles. I double my efforts despite the burning in my lungs. In comparison, I still have about another lap to go before saying my jog\u2019s done. It puts into perspective how out of shape I am.\n\nI focus on nothing but jogging. That helps me complete my task, though because of my doubled efforts and the fact that I started breathing through my mouth near the end, Feels like I\u2019m about to pass out both from a lack of oxygen and the burning in my throat. Still, aside from that final push, Nasera\u2019s advice about nose breathing did help keep my momentum up. Develop a bit more discipline when it comes to breathing, and I can see myself getting used to this whole track thing.\n\nAs I try and catch my breath, I can\u2019t help but have my eyes wander a bit towards Nasera\u2019s plum hips and rear, her booty shorts once again doing me no favors when it comes to their appeal to my baser primate instincts. What\u2019s worse, now that we\u2019re both nice and sweaty, I can\u2019t help but catch a whiff of her post-workout musk...\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my testosterone feeling high after the workout, the endorphins making me feel all high and mighty, or if there\u2019s some truth to the whole \u2018tomboy aroma\u2019 thing I\u2019ve read so much about in various online forums, but I can\u2019t deny there\u2019s something\u2026 alluring\u2026 about Nasera\u2019s post-workout scent. It\u2019s honestly making it very hard to keep a party from starting inside my trousers...\n\nI shake my head and ignore the thoughts going through my mind. No easy task considering the kind of beauty that\u2019s standing a few feet away from me, though. God, I wasn\u2019t such a lame example of my species. I\u2019d walk right up to Nasera and\u2026 and\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t finish those thoughts as I notice, much to my horror, that Nasera\u2019s walking right towards me. \n\n\u201cGood job on the jog!\u201d the ptero cheers as she closes the distance between us and pats me on the shoulder. \u201cWith that, you\u2019ve taken your first step into the wonderful world of fitness!\u201d she says, all the while giving me the widest, warmest smile yet.\n\nNasera\u2019s words were nothing short of encouraging, yet something about them made me feel a bit uneasy. A part of me still feels strange about becoming so embroiled in a world that I have tried to avoid for so long. But as I look at Nasera\u2019s warm smile and let her words sink into my being, I begin to feel something in my heart that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever really experienced before, a fluttery sensation that fills me with a sense of self-worth that makes me feel like I\u2019m worth a damn for the first time in my life...  \n\nNasera reaches for her cellphone and grimaces. \u201cI was hoping we\u2019d have time to do some cool-down exercises, but we have about ten minutes before the football team, and cheer squad kicks us out of the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t the football team a part of the sports club?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey used to be, but they broke off and became their own department a year before I started attending Volcano High. They do their own thing nowadays and have quite the rivalry with our club.\u201d Nasera lets out a sigh as she again motions for me to follow. \u201cLet\u2019s hit the showers and call it for now. We\u2019ll resume the workouts in the afternoon with the other members of the club.\u201d Before we reach the building, Nasera turns around and gives me another smile. \u201cOh, and before I forget, meet me back in the office after you\u2019re all done. Have to do a brief debrief.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not sure why Nasera wants to debrief me, but I don't argue with her. Probably more information about the afternoon meeting.\n\nGod, it feels weird thinking that. I again have to ask myself what I\u2019m doing and where this is taking me...\n\nI down the last of my water and head straight for the showers. As I do, I start to notice a few students already filtering into the locker rooms. They don\u2019t seem to see me, but I see them and their almost larger-than-life profiles. It doesn\u2019t take me much to realize they have to be a part of the football team.\n\nJesus, how the fuck can you be in high school and still be that big\u2026?\n\nI jump into the shower, do what I need to do to stop smelling like sweat and grime, and slip on my regular clothes, stuffing my new club uniform into the locker. After some consideration, I look down at my old shoes and stuff them into the locker as well. \n\nThank you for all your years of service, but it\u2019s time you guys got a nice long break...\n\nWith that done, I head for the office and meet up with Nasera, who is also back to wearing her usual clothes. \n\n\u201cOh hey, that was fast!\u201d Nasera chirps, taking a seat on her desk. \u201cMight have already told you, but you did really well for your first morning jog. I think you might be ready to increase the length to four miles!\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves,\u201d I tell Nasera with an uneasy grin. \u201cI still struggled a bit towards the end. Fucked up and started breathing through my mouth, which is why I was so out of breath by the time I finished.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Nasera exclaims with genuine surprise. \u201cI\u2026 didn\u2019t really notice that. Though now that you mention it, that would explain why you were looking all addled back there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 let\u2019s go with that,\u201d I say before letting out a single chuckle. \u201cIf I had to describe the jog itself thought, I\u2019d say it was\u2026\u201d\n\nWas it\u2026 great? Wonderful, even? Is that the right word I\u2019d use to describe it? I mean, I don\u2019t have much in the way of reference when it comes to it. Yet, at the same time, the feelings of gratification that I got after finishing is something that I can\u2019t describe but understand all too well as wholly positive.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d I end up saying as sincerely as I can manage to make my voice sound. \u201cOh, and the protein shake before it was also pure bliss!\u201d I say, subconsciously licking my lips.\n\n\u201cYou liked the shake that much?\u201d Nasera asks, her eyes widening and her cheeks growing rosy.\n\nI nod in reply. \u201cBest protein shake I\u2019ve ever drunk! What\u2019s the brand? I wanna get some for myself. I\u2019ma drink it every day before our meetings!\u201d  \n\nMy own words cause me to pause. Wasn\u2019t I thinking about finding some way to quit the club not that long ago? Was a single jogging session all it took to get me onboard? I mean, it wasn\u2019t even an official meeting. More of a trial run...\n\nNasera lets out a giggle and looks to the side, her cheeks now very obviously glowing red. \u201cThe\u2026 the protein powder I use is homemade\u2026\u201d She turns back to face me with a big broad grin on her lips. \u201cI-I\u2019m glad\u2026 that you like it so much\u2026\u201d she stammers out a bit, all the while she fidgets a bit with her hands. \u201c...If you want\u2026 I-I can share the recipe with you\u2026 B-but\u2026\u201d My club captain looks me in the eyes with determination. \u201cI\u2019ll only share the recipe with you if you promise to give it your absolute best in the coming months!\u201d\n\nI once again find myself asking whether I plan to stay on in Nasera\u2019s sports club. Am I ready to commit to something so big so soon? As cheesy as it sounds, my decision could very well have repercussions for my future. Granted, they can very well be GOOD repercussions, but I don\u2019t know that. Not yet anyway... \n\nBefore either myself or Nasera can get out another word, My phone alarm goes off, one I had forgotten I\u2019d set as a secondary in case my bedside alarm stopped working for whatever reason. \n\nI look at my device\u2019s display and see that it\u2019s now 7:00. This would be around the time when I\u2019m waking up and going through my morning routine before flying out of the house, hopefully before 7:30. From there, the four-mile flight to the bus station followed. If all went well, I was usually at school a little before 8:45, which gave me just shy of fifteen minutes before homeroom.\n\nNasera points to my phone. \u201cYeah, you definitely need to adjust your alarm from now on. I suggest you set it to 4:45 so you can be ready by five.\u201d\n\nWith a nod, I do as Nasera instructs. That makes the ptero chuckle a bit, probably because of my enthusiasm or something like that. \n\n\u201cSince you\u2019re here an hour earlier than you normally would be, what\u2019re you planning on doing until class starts?\u201d Nasera asks.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t really know,\u201d I answer. \u201cI mean, I guess I can go to the closest convenience store and get something cheap for breakfast?\u201d\n\nAt my words, Nasera\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cOh, I have an idea!\u201d she exclaims as she stands up from her desk. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have ourselves a REAL breakfast!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m taken a bit aback by the suggestion.\n\nNasera\u2019s response is to give me a wide cheeky grin as she wraps a hand around my shoulder. \u201cMight as well celebrate you joining the sports club, as well as the new clothes, no?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m that comfortable \u2018celebrating,\u2019 as Nasera puts it...\n\n\u201cHey, if you\u2019re worried about paying for the meal, then don\u2019t. My treat!\u201d Nasera chimes in, almost as if sensing some of my unease over the matter. \u201cBesides, this is also a \u2018two birds, one stone\u2019 type thing, since I also have to go pick up my sis\u2014I mean, sibling\u2026\u201d the ptero lets out a tired sigh at those words. \u201cFang got banned from using public transportation after she got into a fight with another passenger. Something about being \u2018misgendered\u2019 or some stupid gender-politic bull. Lady wasn\u2019t really hurt, but she made such a huge fuss that the police had to get involved...\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d I start, but I don\u2019t dare finish my thoughts. \n\nI may not be that familiar with Fang personally. Still, from our cold interactions as lab partners and occasional lunch buddies, Nasera\u2019s sister can be quite the insufferable bitch\u2026\n\n\u201cThat sucks,\u201d I salvage my previously started statement and give Nasera my most sympathetic gaze.\n\n\u201cI swear, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that dad\u2019s in the police force, Fang would be in jail by now,\u201d Nasera hisses through gritted teeth. \u201cBecause of that ban, I\u2019m probably gonna have to chaperone her\u2014them\u2014to and from school for the rest of the school year, or at least until dad can work more of his magic and get Lu\u2014I mean, Fang\u2014un-banned from using public transportation...\u201d\n\nI make a mental note to never mess with Nasera father since he sounds like someone I don't want mad at me, especially if he has enough pull to keep someone from getting arrested for assault...\n\n\u201cLike\u2026 shit!\u201d Nasera suddenly shouts as she lets go of my shoulder. \u201cAs if Fang wasn\u2019t already giving me enough bullshit over the botched concert last week, now I have to deal with this! And all for what? Because they have this enbie phase going\u2026\u201d\n\nI recall the concert vividly. Nasera invited me to go. I went because of free pizza, but I ended up getting a hell of a lot more than I bargained for.  I still feel kinda shitty for laughing at Fang, Trish, and Reeda, even if their music did suck. I mean, two basses? Who the hell uses two basses?\n\nNasera closes her eyes and takes a deep breath to calm herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I suddenly shoved that shit on you, Anon. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d she again sighs and looks down at the floor. \u201cRegardless of whatever she says or does, Fang\u2019s my sister\u2026 and I\u2019m going to do everything that I can as her younger sibling to support her.\u201d The ptero again looks up, her brows furrowing in an expression that doesn\u2019t fit in with Nasera\u2019s natural beauty. \u201cEven if her whole gender act is a way to get attention!\u201d she spits out with far more vitriol than she probably intended. \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I start, already feeling like I\u2019m privy to far more information than I\u2019m comfortable knowing. \u201cSounds like you\u2019ve got a full plate this morning. So\u2026\u201d I rub the back of my neck and try to give my new club captain as easy a smile as I can manage. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we put a pin on the whole celebratory breakfast? I\u2019ll\u2026 leave you to your business\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t wait around to see Nasera\u2019s expression. I turn the fuck around and take a step out of the office.\n\n\u201cA-Anon, w-wait!\u201d Nasera exclaims. At the same time, I feel a hand grab onto my wrist. \u201cI\u2026 I know\u2026\u201d she starts in a soft and vulnerable voice before clearing her throat. \u201cI know we\u2019ve only known each other for a week and a half, but in that time, I feel like you\u2019ve... become a good friend.\u201d She lets go of my arm as I turn around to face her. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a bit too much to ask from someone who I just became friends with\u2026 but... can you stick around while I pick up Fang?\u201d Almost as soon as she asks me that favor, she raises her hands and waves them around as if trying to keep me from getting heated over her words. \u201cY-you don\u2019t have to t-talk to them\u2026 or even acknowledge they are there! I-I-I-I\u2026 I just want someone else there to keep the drive from feeling so awkward\u2026\u201d \n\nI inwardly grumble. The last thing I want is to get mixed up in some kind of family drama. I try to think of a way to get out of the situation unfolding before me, but any idea dies as something else in me pushes me to help out my club captain. \n\nIf nothing else, because I owe her for the new clothes. I\u2019d also be lying if I said that her pretty face also wasn\u2019t a factor.\n\nHowever\u2026\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll help you out,\u201d I reply, causing Nasera\u2019s expression to lighten significantly. \u201cBut,\u201d I add before the ptero can get a word in, \u201cYou owe me an extra-large breakfast!\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal!\u201d Nasera acknowledges with far more cheer than I expected.\n\n\u201cNow \u2018common, we have to hurry if we want to get that breakfast AND pick up my sibling before school starts!\u201d Nasera announces as she leads me out of the office, which she locks up on the way out.\n\nI voice no argument. I don\u2019t say anything as the two of us walk back to the car. I have a thousand and one thoughts going through my mind though, but none of them would make the situation feel any less strange. \n\nNever in a million years did I imagine myself not only joining a sports club, but also befriending its eleven out of ten babe of a captain while also helping her deal with family troubles having to do with a sister who, despite what most dinos may tell you, was a pretty decent nine out of ten, her whole gender rebellion notwithstanding...\n\nWhen we reach the car yet again, I once again can\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow at its looks. \u2018Like, why\u2019s it split down the middle aesthetically? It\u2019s a nice car, though. Definitely unique\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cOh, you like my car?\u201d Nasera asks, smiling as she unlocks her door and pops it open. \u201cQuite the beauty, isn\u2019t she? Even gave her a name: the \u2018Nasera-Mobil!\u2019\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t help but chuckle at the name my captain gave her car. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a cute name\u2026 but it\u2019s also a bit tacky, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t think it\u2019s that tacky\u2026\u201d Nasera says before pouting a bit. \u201cWhat would you name it, since you seem to be in the business of naming things,\u201d Nasera demands, crossing her arms all the while giving me an expectant look. \n\nI stop to think about it for a second. The car's split down the middle, one side clean while the other rough. It matches its owner in that regard, so it has to bear part of Nasera\u2019s name. And the car\u2019s\u2026 well, a car. \u2018Mobil\u2019 is an outdated term, though. It makes it sound like one of those golden-age superhero vehicles designed to sell toys to gullible little children.\n\nSo, Nasera\u2019s Car. Nas\u2026 Car...\n\nI snap my fingers and grin. \n\n\u201cHow about NasCar?\u201d I suggest to my club captain.\n\nNasera\u2019s eyes grow to the size of dinner plates in wonder as she unfurls her arms. \u201cAnon... that\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s an amazing name!\u201d She cheers, running a hand over the roof of her car. As she does, she lets out a laugh as she slides into her seat, something I do to speed the process of taking off along. \u201cNasCar,\u201d she whispers in an almost dream-like tone. \u201cThat\u2019s just so damn creative... No wonder you guys taught us dinos how to use fire and tools and agriculture. Humans are such geniuses!\u201d\n\nI pretend not to hear what Nasera said, even though I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s supposed to be a compliment. I\u2019m too busy basking in the afterglow of my achievement when it comes to coming up with witty, punny names.\n\n\u201cOne more thing to celebrate!\u201d Nasera announces as she ignites the engine, which roars as if also happy about the new name. \u201cTo the newly renamed NasCar!\u201d she declares as she pulls out of the parking lot and flies down the street at more than sixty miles an hour.\n\nI very quickly clip on my seatbelt. The last thing I want is for my time of glory to end with me as a red stain on the NasCar\u2019s window..."},"NTR Stands For Naser Topping Retards.txt":{"path":["Naser And Nasera","NTR Stands For Naser Topping Retards.txt"],"text":"Title: NTR Stands For Naser Topping Retards\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Naser and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nNaser pushes me up against the bathroom stall, his large maw devouring \u00a0my lower face as we start kissing. It's just as awkward as it was with Fang when we first tried, but thanks to my experience I'm able to guide him correctly. I run my hands over his lithe muscular back, basking in the moment, before pulling my head away to gasp for air.\n\n\"Shit, Naser. Are you sure? Aren't you and Naomi still a thing? And what about your sister?\" Naser smirks, a hand expertly snaking down into my pants as he finds my growing erection. Clawed finger tips delicately grab hold of my salomi, and I let out a moan as he begins rubbing his hand up and down the length.\n\nThere's a shit eating grin on his face as he leans in next to my ear, his voice a \u00a0husky whisper. \"Don't worry. No homo.\" Those four words are enough to send me over the edge, my mind suddenly racing back to green hills and tall palm trees. That's right. My favorite childhood game. The one on the Gamerock.

Working third shift is hell on my body and mind, but I guess I need the money if I'm ever going to college. I still didn't know what to tell Dad; What would I even go for? I guess I like graphic design, but going thirty grand into debt for something like that probably isn't secure. I wouldn't even call myself good at it, there are--\n\nNo. I can't think like that. I need to be positive. Wow, if that doesn't sound hollow in my head. Still, I can't break that feeling-- the one that tells me things will be better one day. The thought of stocking shelves for eternity, smoking weed, and listening to heavy metal in a shitty apartment for the rest of my life might sound peaceful, but.. I know there's something more for me. There has to be, if there was something more for her.\n\nHer. That pale pterosaur. The one that I watched make a fool of herself on stage in front of nearly half the school. Poured out her heart and soul, and they all laughed. We all laughed. I still have that video saved on my phone. It was the equivalent of a caveman's broken war cry in an opera, how could we not? I guess it felt good watching somebody else fuck up their life, that way I could avoid thinking about how I didn't know what to do with mine. The crooked amusement didn't last long; the memory faded from my mind as fast as it came. She sure showed us.\n\nI nearly didn't go to prom, but Anne convinced me to go with her friend group. Probably out of pity, but I didn't care. We barely even spoke, I just drank punch and insulted the music in passing to a bunch of strangers. The occasional agreement and snicker were my only positive feelings that night. The announcement of Prom King and Queen was no surprise, everybody knew those two were the perfect couple. I was standing alone, waiting for the moment I could leave. I was only here for the participatory acknowledgement from future friends when we inevitably talk about our lives. That was, until she walked on stage. I didn't even know there was going to be a music performance, but I couldn't take my eyes off of that girl. The flowing purple dress, the sleek white guitar, those eyes.. it was like an angel just walked on stage. I heard whispered murmurs of discontent, and some part of my brain shared them, ready to laugh in amusement.\n\nThen she started playing. The anticipation of her playing a broken mess only served to heighten the feeling of her song's crescendo. I had never, not once, seen somebody in their element as much as I had that night. A pure expression of happiness poured over that girl's face as she played, proudly showing everybody who had laughed at her only months ago her true beauty. Love, passion, and purpose all magnified into that ballad. Fang's ballad. Then came the slow decline, and the farewell message from her to the rest of Volcano High. I stood there in stunned silence as people began cheering around me. Then, he jumped on stage. That weirdo human, the one that was shamed during an assembly I had skipped. There was no hesitation; a loving embrace as the two shared a kiss, unashamedly themselves. I only wished that I could grow and love like those two had. I got a saved copy of the whole event from Anne, no surprise people were recording. I still listen to it sometimes. The human even kind of looks like me.\n\nProm was more than a month ago. A lot of that feeling's gone from me now, but some part of it won't leave. A part that begs me to be a better person, to pour more of my time and money into my hobbies, and being unashamedly myself. And there's the worst part of it all; I don't even know who I am. I need to figure that out before I can actually do anything. Music, art, video games, the internet; how much of it is finding myself, and how much of it is a distraction so I don't have to find myself? I just wish it wasn't so hard to--\n\n\"Yo, I need a light.\"\n\nI snap back to attention. Here I am, behind the convenience store, at nearly two in the morning on break. I haven't even lit my cigarette, it's been sitting in my hand for who-knows how long. I get lost in thought a lot. At least I don't mumble, that would be a nightmare.\n\n\"Dude.\"\n\nI finally look towards the voice; a green hand with sharp claws was waiting, expectantly. I stare at it for a few moments, confused. What does she want?\n\n\"Give me the fuckin' lighter.\"\n\nOh, right. I reach out my left hand, dropping the blue BIC lighter that I've been holding for the last several minutes into her hand. She accepts it, placing a fresh cigarette into her snout and lighting it deftly. Looks like she's already on her second. She doesn't return my lighter, so I just put my cigarette back into its carton, pocketing it. I stopped smoking for a few weeks after Prom, but I started again. Even though I know it hurts me, I can't muster the will to give it up. The strength that Fang gave me must have faded. I wish I made better use of it.\n\nI looked to my left, on the other side of the back door, towards her. The green baryonyx with tired eyes and shaggy hair that reminded me of a lush forest. If anybody had the kind of strength I wish I had, it was her. The reflective metal wheelchair was the first thing anybody would notice about her; it tells the story of her struggles to all who lay eyes on it, even if she barely addresses them. I know Olivia hates pity, but sometimes I can't help it. I like to think about who she could've been, if she didn't have to waste all her energy on struggling against that metallic prison.\n\nWe've known each other for about ten years, but most of those don't really count. We lived on the same block in a barely middle class suburb. I wasn't such a shut-in back then, so we would play outside a lot. Ride bikes, play tag, make mud pies, that sort of thing. I could hardly keep up with her most of the time. I guess you could've called her a tomboy. Even then, Olivia still did really well in elementary school. Would always tease me about my grades, and clap in my face whenever I'd space out; especially in the middle of class. I almost wanted to move seats, but she was my only real friend. I guess I liked it that way; I liked having somebody to catch up to, to smile with, to grow with. She used to catch butterflies. I would try to copy her, but I'd never catch anything. I drew pictures of them instead, on a notebook I had for school. Olivia was pretty bad at art, so one day she tried to tease me about drawing butterflies. I decided to give the picture to her as a gift, and I'll never forget that blush. Catching her off-guard was a high feat for me, so I followed it up with a promise. I promised her that one day, I'll be able to catch butterflies, and she'll be able to draw them. She smiled, and took me up on that promise.\n\n..I wasn't even there when it happened. Mom made me wash dishes after school; I guess I forgot to the night before. I was getting ready to go outside when we both heard the high-pitched screams. Mom told me to stay inside while she left, but I ignored her after about five seconds. Took about a minute to jog towards the scream before I saw it. A red, low riding sporty car jumped over the curb, and Olivia being held by a stranger while another one was calling the police. There wasn't even any blood, and I had no idea what people were upset about; she just looked asleep in the grass. Mom grabbed my hand, and pulled me away back to the house. It was dead silent for the rest of the evening. When Dad got home, it looked like he already knew. He didn't act upset about it; he was probably more upset I had to see something like that.\n\nWe visited her in the hospital a week later. I never talked to Olivia's parents much, but Mom and Dad knew them well enough. The first time we went, she wasn't even awake. The tears never stopped from her mother. Olivia's dad seemed completely out of it the whole time. Seeing Olivia hooked up to all those machines, I thought it was more like a cool movie scene than something to cry over. Mom took me there every day for a week, and I'd wait. Wait for her to wake up. I drew a lot of butterflies next to that bed. Even started doing some other bugs. I think it was three weeks before I got to visit her awake. Olivia barely changed. She talked about how excited she was to finally go outside after so long in a bed. I showed her some of the pictures that I drew, and she remembered our promise. We pinky swore on it. I saw her three more times after that. By that point, Mom only let me visit once a week, instead of every day. Trust me, I tried to see her more often. The staff had to call my parents several times after I managed to bike to the hospital without Mom knowing. The first two times we visited, I had to show her some of the school work that she missed, but she never really cared. We ended up talking about bugs and plants, joking and acting like nothing had changed.\n\nThe third time I went, I met the new Olivia. A dejected, broken girl in a wheelchair pushed by her father. They told me she couldn't walk anymore. I tried to talk to her, but Olivia wouldn't say anything to me, even about the things we used to like. Eventually, she got mad. Said she didn't want to talk to me anymore. Her family moved off the block, not sure where to. Just like that, I didn't have anyone I could call a friend. My parents never really worried about me, even when I turned into a walking zombie. Through middle and high school, I was a ghost in everybody's lives. Nobody knew who I was, and I didn't know who I was. Still don't, apparently. I'd call myself an elephant for remembering almost everything that happened back then, but the truth is, nothing's really happened since; even after I met Olivia again. It was in the middle of senior year. She must've moved back, or something. It took me a week to even approach her, and we only spoke a few words. I got her phone number. Sometimes, we send each other memes. I started working here after I saw she was. She barely reacted to me showing up out of the blue. I was hoping our grand reunion would be more spectacular than this; excited chatter about what she's been up to, and how she's been. But it looks like that's not happening.\n\nMaybe this is how I was, as a kid: silent, spaced out, closed off. Maybe I have to be what Olivia used to be for me. Can I even spare the effort? I still don't know who I am. Don't know what I can do, or what I feel, or what I'm capable of, or if I'll make things worse. Then again.. I doubt she knew all that back then, either. Just.. do something. The only person who ever cared about you is less than five feet away, and here you are, leaning against a wall, dead silent. But.. she's doing the same, isn't she? Staring off into the distance, taking occasional drags from that cigarette. Maybe she's thinking the same thing. Does she still care about me? Does she remember that promise? My mind races through fears of rejection and anger, but the thought of Fang suppresses them. Just-- speak. You'll only ever get an answer if you talk to her. \n\nWell, here goes.\n\n\"Hey Olivia.\"\n\nHer pale yellow eyes drift over to me lazily, and she gives me a half-hearted \"Huh.\" I don't think that's a good thing. I reach into my repertoire of charming speech from various sources of media I've consumed over the years.\n\n\"How's it going?\"\n\nShe replies with a one word \"Fine.\" Alright, I expected as much. Let me try something a little more risky.\n\n\"You wanna do something after work?\"\n\nA few seconds pass. She's considering, good. Now she's checking her phone.\n\n\"At six in the morning? Sleep.\"\n\nWell, fuck. One of the only times I break the silence, and I say some stupid shit like that. She's even laughing at me. Seriously, how did I not--\n\nWait, she's laughing?\n\nOlivia let out a quiet snicker in response to what I said. I rarely see her smile about anything, and I don't think I've heard her laugh once since we met again. In the confusion, I let silence fall over us. Her head turns from me towards the night sky, taking a deep breath. Am I overthinking this? Just.. talk to her.\n\n\"What time is it?\"\n\nOlivia's eyes drift towards me for a moment, and then fix themselves on her phone screen.\n\n\"Two thirty five. Break ended five minutes ago.\"\n\nOh, right. Work. I really don't want to lose this job, so it's probably best if I go back in. But first--\n\n\"Can I get my lighter back?\"\n\nWithout looking at me, Olivia tosses the blue BIC lighter into the air. I manage to catch it, impressed by myself. Olivia wheels herself towards the door, as well. She probably doesn't want to get fired, either. I grab the handle of the steel door, kicking the wooden wedge that held it ajar into the hallway and pulling the door open. Taking a couple steps in, I hold the door for Olivia as she rolls toward it. She stops, staring at me with a look of indignation. We both silently look at each other for several seconds before she grabs hold of the door with her own arm fiercely, still staring me down. I relent, letting go of the handle and backing into the hallway. She struggles, but manages to roll herself in while keeping the door open. It shuts with a heavy thud, and Olivia rolls past me without ever matching my gaze, clearly in a soured mood.\n\nIt takes me several seconds to realize my mistake. She must've thought I was patronizing her somehow, even if I didn't mean it. Should I apologize? Was I in the wrong?.. either way, standing here in a dark musty hallway isn't helping, so I follow after Olivia. She's surprisingly quick at positioning herself behind the register, and before I can say anything to her, I can tell she's purposely avoiding looking at me. Lowering my eyes, I mutter an apology that I'm not even sure she hears. Looking around the store instead, it seems like nobody but us has been inside since we took our break. Not wanting to further damage whatever could be salvaged of Olivia and I's friendship, I decide to leave her alone and go do my job. I enter the stock room, looking around for a wooden clipboard to finish a job I had started before we went outside. Counting units. Par for the course. It should take me all but five minutes to finish it, since I just have to write down the correct label and number of units in stock.\n\nIt took me a few minutes to finish. I wonder if Olivia is still upset at me about what happened. Peaking around the corner, I still see her waiting patiently at the register, reading a paperback book. She notices me, and our eyes meet for a few moments before she looks away, her expression an odd mix between anger and shame. I step back into the storeroom, frowning. Butterflies flutter around in my stomach as I think about the situation with the door, but I still don't know what to say. Maybe I should apologize, but I really shouldn't risk pushing it. I look at the wooden clipboard in my hand, along with the sheet of paper to track inventory. Flipping over the sheet, I notice the back of it is blank. As my mind finds itself thinking about the past, I rest on the one solid metal chair in this room and begin to sketch on the blank paper. Despite the hiccup, I feel better than I have in several weeks. The feeling of hope and the desire for change that filled my heart on Prom night washes over me briefly. Maybe this is the turning point; maybe Raptor Jesus is trying to help me. I don't know. For now, whatever happens, I need to be thankful for everything that's happened; both the good and the bad. For Fang and that human. For Mom and Dad. For Raptor Jesus. For Olivia. Thanks to everyone, I might have a chance to find out who I am, fill this hole in my heart, and help the only friend I've ever had do the same.\n\nI finish the drawing. It's a picture of a butterfly.","Title":"Catching Butterflies","Status":"On-Going","Characters":"Olivia, Naser, Tracy and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Anonymous"},"Catching Butterflies Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Olivia","Catching Butterflies Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"~Catching Butterflies: Chapter Two~\n\nI stare at the cloudy sky above me, sliding my palms against the damp grass that I've been lying on. I'm glad to be home; it's almost as beautiful as I remembered. I lift my head off the ground, supporting myself with my elbows as I look ahead. From the side of this grassy hill, I can see my old neighborhood. My old house. It barely stands out, since every house on this street looks similar. Cheap, middle class houses birthing suburban communities; it's becoming a lot more common nowadays, and the standardization of it all is almost creepy, but that doesn't matter much to me. It takes some getting used to, but most of my only good memories were in this place. Suddenly, I hear rustling from close behind me. Looking up instinctively, I see a green face with a protruding snout and lush hair that breezes lightly in the wind. A bent-over Olivia stares down at me with a gentle smile, and our eyes meet. The sincerity of that expression soothes my soul, and I can't help but smile back. My eyes drift to her revealing tank top.\n\nOh, wow. To hide my embarrassed expression, I lower my head and spin myself around to start getting up, hoping she somehow wasn't paying attention. It was pointless, though, as a howling laughter fills the air and mocks me as I try to stand. Using my knees to steady myself against the ground, I look up once again towards Olivia. Still giggling, she zips up her nylon sporting jacket and offers me a hand. Despite those razor sharp claws, I grab it firmly, and she uses her surprising strength to help me to my feet. Taking a moment to brush my jeans off, I do my best to wipe what's left of the embarrassment from my face and speak to her.\n\n\"So.. is it as nice as you remember?\"\n\nOlivia's eyes drift around the neighborhood in response to my question. It's easy to see at least half of it from up here. Her bittersweet smile reverberated her inner thoughts of reflection. I wasn't quite sure when she moved in, or who else she knew besides me; perhaps she's thinking of things I've never done, or people I've never met. As her eyes dart toward me, I can tell she's found her answer. Olivia's always been excited to talk about how she feels.\n\n\"Dude, it's almost perfect! Oh man, you remember that time when we were riding Razor scooters by that one construction zone and you crashed into a mud pit? Or- yeah, when you would never eat the crusts from your sandwich, so I kept stuffing them into a bunch of anthills and they had to call pest control cause there were so many? \"\n\nRecounting some of our adventures with an energetic smile, she could barely stop giggling by the end of it. She reminisced like it was yesterday, those pleasant memories everlasting in her mind. It brought me an unfathomable amount of joy to see the old Olivia again. I knew I wasn't very expressive, but Olivia could always read me like an open book. She was happy, and she knew I was happy. After the laughter died down, I motioned down the hill, back towards the street.\n\n\"You wanna head back down? I kind of want to see the other side o-\"\n\n\"Race you down!\"\n\nWithout a fraction of a second for me to react, Olivia bolts down the hill, and I'm left in proverbial dust. I know I can never beat her, but my body surges with adrenaline anyway. I practically flung myself down the hill after her, narrowly avoiding falling forwards onto my face. I ran as hard as I could, a feeling of exhilaration filling my lungs as I watched the green blur in front of me speed ahead. She's waiting for me by the time I reach the sidewalk, and as I stop, I notice she's barely broken a sweat in contrast to my own panting. That teasing expression crosses her face once again, shaking her head in faux disappointment.\n\nOffering me a few pats on the back as I catch my breath, we soon begin to walk down streets of the neighborhood, looking at the houses in passing. Olivia always walks at a faster pace than I do, and she occasionally glances at me as I try to keep up; I can hear the teasing words before they even leave her mouth. To my surprise, she doesn't say anything about it, and continues to regale stories from our childhood. I'm sure I've heard all of these at least once, but she always tells them differently every time. Even knowing what she's about to say, I couldn't help but find myself drawn in by her words. So much so, that the fifteen minute walk almost seemed like a blur. By the time I knew it, we were at the other side of the neighborhood, standing on the sidewalk. There was an equally large hill on this side, one that was infamous amongst every kid who lived here. Every winter, it got covered in a sheet of ice that was perfect for sledding. I almost debated-\n\n\"Man, we GOTTA come back in January. You remember that one sled race we did, when your mom bought you that blue sled? Hah! A-And then you hit Anthony's fence cause you didn't know how to stop, and his dad got super pissed!\"\n\nWhile I was sincerely hoping she didn't remember that, Olivia's giggling shed any sense of embarrassment from my mind. I couldn't help but reminisce about it myself.\n\n\"Yeah- he threatened to call the police. Dad had to pay to fix it, and I had to mow lawns every weekend over the summer to pay him back. Heh.. you used to stand on the sidewalk-\"\n\nA sudden burst of laughter emits from Olivia. \"Y-Yeah, and I would just yell at you to go faster the whole time, and you would get mad, but you couldn't chase me cause you were too tired after you were done!\"\n\nThe fond memory causes me to laugh as well. As we both finish giggling, our eyes meet. Those pale, yellow eyes that contain so much of the joy we both shared as kids. My heart flutters briefly, and I look away, blushing. Searching for something to say to break the embarrassment, I speak at random.\n\n\"Y-Yeah, that was the summer you tried to teach me how to catch butterflies, and then you got hit by a-\"\n\nWait, what?\n\nI snap to Olivia, confused beyond all expression. She stares back at me, a similar confusion painted across those otherwise pretty features.\n\n\"Got hit by a what?\"\n\nI couldn't help but stare at her legs. The ones that shouldn't work anymore. But she looks just like she did last night, at the-\n\nMy train of thought is violently interrupted by the sound of a car horn. Looking up, I spot a pair of bright xenon headlights barreling towards us. Olivia hasn't even turned her head yet. My body acts on pure instinct. Moving faster than I ever have before, I reach out to the baryonyx with both arms, grabbing her body tightly and violently throwing her out of the way. The expression of fear in Olivia's eyes as she stumbles several feet to the left is the last thing I see before contact, a sudden chill shooting through my body. \n\nA sudden chill that jolts me awake. My eyes scan my surroundings, seeing nothing but the blurry environment of the small apartment I've lived in for almost a year now. My reptile brain senses no danger anymore, and I lie back down; the chilling wind of what just happened washes over me again. I almost never have dreams that vivid, and the events aren't fading from my mind like they normally do. Exploring those childhood memories with my only friend.. the overpowering sensation of joy and sorrow mesh together to form a disgusting combination in my heart. I almost wish I had never woken up. It's only then that I notice the tears; the ones budding at the edges of my eyes. The positive blanket that Fang had draped over me months ago was pierced, and the protective veil of apathy and avoidance it had replaced could no longer protect me.\n\nFor a moment, I thought about resisting the sorrow, finding some sort of distraction to prevent what little dignity I have from flowing out of my eyes. There was nobody here to prove anything to, but society's always taught me that stoicism is strength. Don't I need to be strong, just like she is, if I ever want to connect with her? What kind of man would I be if I bawled like a child after a bad dream? Practically countering this train of thought, my mind drifts towards something else. Distant memories, lessons taught to me by Bob Ross and Mister Rogers, proliferating in opposition to the fear. The people I looked up to as a child; they all shared the same sentiment. There'll never be a rainbow without the rain. How can I ever find happiness or strength if I don't know what sadness or weakness looks like? These words shine resolute amongst the cacophony of doubt that flows through my head. The will to change, to avoid being paralyzed by fear that things will only get worse, isn't that what I've been trying to find? What harm is there in losing myself here and now? Am I afraid of what I'll see? I make up my mind. I allow the doubts to fade from my head, just like I did last night, and relax. No more struggling.\n\nI can't remember the last time I've actually cried. Resisting the urge to stifle anything, I allow the tears to flow gently from my eyes, staining both my shirt and my bedsheets. The stream is occasionally dried by the edge of my blanket as I clear my vision. The feelings of guilt from wasted teenage years and the lack of emotional connections fuel the next fifteen minutes I spend like this. My face feels like it's on fire; six years of pent up aggression and sorrow radiate from it and evaporate into the cool morning air. By the end of it, I can barely think; a catharsis so powerful it utterly destroyed anything but the most basic of routine. I lift myself from the mattress, dragging myself towards my dresser, and collect a few articles of clothing without even looking at them. I trudge my way into the bathroom, hanging my clothes on a rack and peeling the soaked white t-shirt from my body. I can't help but stare at myself in the mirror. That expression of pain, of a puffed up frown, of sorrowful exhausted eyes, nearly sends me recoiling. I turn away, getting ready to take a shower.\n\nThe cool water sprays down on my face and swirls down the drain, taking any evidence of the last twenty minutes with it. My empty mind slowly comes back online as I wash my body, and I can't help but think of Olivia. Knowing she's gone through worse than I could probably ever imagine, the thought of her broken down in tears almost makes me cry again. But that thought doesn't last; as I close my eyes and let the water cleanse me of my guilt, she slowly changes shape in my head. Olivia's barely presentable attitude, masking the years she's spent struggling, gives way to one of happiness, love and affection that reminds me of who she used to be. I open my eyes, trying to reach some sort of conclusion in my head about what *I* actually want. Do I love her, or are we just friends? Are my feelings born from genuine kindness, or am I just trying to change someone for my own benefit? Try as I might, I can't come to an answer. I tell myself it's alright; Rome wasn't built in a day, I still have time to think. After my regular shower routine of soap, shampoo and rinsing, I turn off the water and step out, drying myself off. My clothes barely match, but I put them on anyway.\n\nWhile walking towards the door of the bathroom, I can't help but stop and stare at myself in the mirror. Brushing the light steam from the reflective glass, I stare at my face again; the broken expression that adorned it earlier has all but vanished. I can't help but smile at myself. The reflection in the glass is normally someone I barely recognize, but today, I genuinely see me. I don't need all the answers right now, I just want to do everything I can for her. The shimmer in my pale blue eyes reminds me of something beautiful. It only takes me a few moments to realize where I've seen that uplifting gaze before: on that stage, in Fang's eyes. I was right; there is something more for me, just like there was for her. Content with myself, I leave the bathroom, only to hear the familiar sound of a jazzy phone alarm going off.\n\nI spot my charging phone on top of my dresser. I reach for it, unplugging the cable and grabbing my phone carefully. I blink to clear what remains of my blurred shower vision, raising the screen towards my face. Thumbing the red dismissal button, I check the time. One thirty in the afternoon. Checking my notifications reveals nothing new; a few Snoutchat messages from a group chat, full of people I haven't spoken to in ages. A mobile game reminds me of limited time in-app purchase deals. I have one text message from Olivia. \n\nOpening the message quickly, I see a post-ironic piece of esoteric humor, as has been custom between us for the last month. An orange cat stares at the screen, with a caption in comic sans stating, \"Dear Federal Agents, all my posts are serious and I am a threat to society.\" Hah. It was only sent a few minutes ago, so maybe I should say something to her. I'm not an expert at texting by any means, but I'll give it a shot. Deep breaths.\n\n\"wyd rn?\"\n\nA classic. Just casual enough to be noncommittal, but still gets my point across. I really should stop thinking so hard about this, though. I stare at the screen as I move over to my desk, sitting down in a tiny office chair. The latest in phone technology is too expensive for me, so I don't have any sort of \"Read\" notification to go off of. It takes about three minutes, during which I continue to stress myself out, but she replies.\n\n\"playing re4\"\n\nI do feel a slight amount of guilt for interrupting someone while they're playing Resident Evil 4.\n\n\"wanna go somewhere?\n\nMy thoughts wander towards various places in this city, thinking of a good place to hang out. Maybe not anything that costs money. The reply I get is difficult to decipher:\n\n\"?\"\n\nI'm not sure what just a question mark even means. Does she want to know where, or is that more of a \"really?\" response? Regardless, I still have to think of something. It takes a few minutes of thought, but I remember a small park that's nearby where we work. I used to go there after school occasionally; it's a nice place to relax, especially in the summer. Maybe she'll like it? Just in case, I try to answer all potential questions at the same time.\n\n\"bored. how bout everglade park, 3:00?\"\n\nThis time, it doesn't take her long to respond; only about half a minute.\n\n\"hang on\"\n\nMy mind races back and forth, trying to decide whether or not that response is a good or bad one. I get no response from her for several minutes, so I place my phone on my desk and power on my old desktop computer. It takes a bit, but eventually I can get onto the internet and actually look up the park. I've never done anything there besides walk around, so I want to see if there's anything cool to do. From what I can find, it just looks like a bunch of gazebos and barbecue pits; there is a playground, but I'm not twelve anymore. I can't help but let doubt poison my thoughts, and I consider finding some other place, but I'm interrupted by my phone going off. It's two o'clock right now, and Olivia sent me another text. Let's see.\n\n\"sure\"\n\nWhile it's an uncomfortably short response, having her actually agree to hang out somewhere that isn't work or school is a new experience for me. I can't help but find myself excited, it'll be good to just talk without any distractions. Maybe I'll learn a little about what she's been up to in the last few years. I have about an hour to get ready, but I don't really need that much time. I dry and comb my hair, put on some deodorant, grab my wired earbuds, and browse the internet for about half an hour before I decide to leave. I'm not sure what the next few hours will look like, but I'm hopeful. I take the elevator down to the parking lot of the apartment, approaching my old silver car. After unlocking the door, I take a moment to breathe.\n\nIt's a nice day out. A butterfly flutters over my head. Everything will be alright, as long as I try my hardest for her. For Olivia."},"Catching Butterflies Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Olivia","Catching Butterflies Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"~Catching Butterflies: Chapter Three~\n\nWell, here I am.\n\nI shift my car into park and take the keys out of the ignition, sweat budding on my forehead due to my car's poor air conditioning. Wiping it off with my hand, I look forward, out of the windshield; Everglade Park is in front of me, and it looks about as nice as it did on the internet. I open my door and step out of the car, shutting it firmly and locking the doors just in case. Standing in the mostly empty parking lot, I suddenly feel very out of place; I guess not many people visit parks at three o'clock on a weekday. As far as I can tell, though, I get no suspicious eyes from any nearby pedestrians. I look down at my phone, checking to see if I\u2019ve received any messages from Olivia. None, it looks like. I guess I have time to kill. Between gazing at nearby trees and playing Snake on my phone, the next five minutes are filled with mindless efforts to waste time while occasionally checking my notifications.\n\nAfter roughly five minutes, I spot a vehicle pulling into the parking lot. Hoping it\u2019s Olivia, I turn off my phone and lean against my car while examining the vehicle. It looks to be a beat-up sports car with a large crack in the windshield. I assume it\u2019s not Olivia; she typically shows up at work in an old black SUV, and I can\u2019t think of a single rational person that would drive a wreck like that instead of getting it repaired. The car pulls into a parking space about twenty feet away from me, and the driver side door opens to reveal a dark pterosaur with orange highlights. I would almost say he looks formal, but the floral pattern on his suit jacket evokes anything but professionalism. He doesn\u2019t even seem to notice me, instead making for the trunk of his car. He opens it and lugs out some kind of metal cart, piquing my interest. I watch as he jostles the cart around for several seconds before it unfolds. I realize what I\u2019m staring at now; a wheelchair.\n\nIt all hits me like a brick wall. How the hell did I expect a paraplegic to drive a car? I have literally watched her be dropped off at work several times. I never even offered her a ride, she must've paid for an Uber here. Sure enough, the green baryonyx that I recognize all too well waves a hand from the now-opened passenger side door; not to me, but to the other guy. The pterosaur wheels the chair towards her, trying to assist Olivia into it with some difficulty.  I decide I should probably apologize sooner rather than later; maybe I can still pay the driver with what little cash I could bring with me. It takes all but ten seconds of me walking towards the duo before they both notice me, and the pterosaur eyes me suspiciously, placing himself between me and Olivia as I continue. Eventually stepping within a few feet of the man, I stop and begin to speak. \u201cHey, I was actually g-\u201c\n\nThe pterosaur suddenly interrupts me accusingly. \u201cWho the hell are *you*? What do you want?\u201d I\u2019m taken aback by his words, not sure how to respond to those questions. I try to formulate a diffused reply. \u201cWell, uh.. my name is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRelax, Naser. That\u2019s him.\u201d I\u2019m interrupted a second time by Olivia, who has wheeled herself to the side of the man. These words seem to ease tensions as the man drops his shoulders and sighs to himself. He looks tired, but not depressedly so; The kind of person who works too hard for their own good. Regardless, 'Naser' looks at me, haphazardly waving at me before speaking, \u201cYeah, okay. Sorry about that.\u201d\n\nI look at his hand for a few seconds, trying to come up with an appropriate greeting. I offer the tried-and-true finger guns, snap included. This seems to confuse him, but he doesn\u2019t say anything about it. Instead, he turns towards Olivia, rubbing the back of his head while speaking, \u201cJust call me when you need me to get you, and.. where.\u201d The awkward words linger in the air as Olivia stares at him, a grin forming on her face. \u201cYep, you\u2019re the best, Naser.\u201d He barely seems to recognize the compliment, instead nodding silently as he makes for the driver\u2019s side of his car. There's no doubt he's distracted, or stressed about something; I feel a tinge of guilt for making him bring Olivia here.\n\nLooking at the pterosaur from behind, I get a good look at his wings; they follow the same coloration as the rest of his body, but one is noticeably smaller and covered in scars. I don\u2019t know if they can actually fly, but if they can, I doubt he\u2019d be able to. It\u2019s then that I remember; Prom. Naser, he was the winner of Prom King, next to that orange sorbet girlfriend of his. I silently berate myself for not recognizing him earlier and decide to offer him a few words of kindness that I suspect he needs.\n\n\u201cHey.. Naser.\u201d\n\nHe turns around, looking at me quizzically.\n\n\u201cTake it easy.\u201d \n\nNaser looks to the side, as if considering what I said to him. In return, he offers a barely audible \u201cYeah.\u201d He opens his car door and steps inside, getting ready to leave. Olivia and I clear the way, and Naser pulls out of space, offering a haphazard wave to the both of us from the window of his car before he leaves the parking lot altogether. This leaves me and Olivia standing on the asphalt, and marks the official beginning of.. whatever you\u2019d call this.\n\nWe both look at each other, and I notice that Olivia looks like she just woke up. She's wearing a pair of dark-purple sweat pants, combined with a black graphic tee that reads \"BERSERK\". I'm not sure what I expected her to show up in, but now that I think about it, I'm not sure she'd be able to wear much summer-appropriate clothing. Trying to prevent my mind from lingering on what Olivia would look like in a sundress, I consider my own clothes. A pair of jeans, a two-tone shirt that looks like it came straight out of the eighties, and a navy cap. Maybe I shouldn't be so judgmental with what other people wear. Also, now that I think about it, her eyes are oddly bloodshot; Is she just tired, or is she on something?\n\n\"Uh.. Dude?\"\n\nI blink myself out of the train of thought, and realize I've been staring at Olivia for the last twenty or so seconds. I notice the slightest tinge of a blush cross her face before we both seem to turn our heads in opposite directions. Hoping to clear the air, I motion towards the main path of the park, trying to speak casually. \"We can go now, the.. flowers should be.. in full bloom.\" I had next to no idea if that was true or not, but Olivia seemed to recover quickly, offering a firm \"Yeah, we'll see.\" in reply. We make it to the sidewalk, which winds through a collection of trees and rocks. With Olivia wheeling herself behind me as I walk slowly, I decide to make small talk to pass the time while we enjoy the scenery.\n\n\"So.. Berserk, is that a band, or...\" I trail off. Olivia responds almost defensively, \"Nah, it's a.. book.\" Nodding, I reply, \"That sounds cool. I don't really read much, not past the stuff from English.\" She shrugs, and my attention is pulled towards a large tree that we pass. I gesture to it, asking, \"What kind of tree is that?\"  Olivia seems to awkwardly respond, \"Pretty sure that's an oak tree.\" Conversing like this is physically painful. I figured the right questions would come to me, like they had in the past, but I'm drawing a blank right now. Olivia looks bored, but doesn't express any discontent and continues to move with me. I decide to try to get her talking; hopefully that'll give her more interest in the conversation.\n\n\"So, where\u2019d you meet Naser?\u201d\n\nOlivia thinks for a few moments, eventually offering a matter-of-fact explanation. \u201cOur dads know each other. We sorta have to be friends, but he\u2019s real cool, so I\u2019m not complaining or anything.\u201d I reply in agreement, \u201cHe seems like a cool guy. By the way, sorry about not offering you a ride, I forgot\u2014\u201d Olivia interrupts me, waving her hand dismissively. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I can take care of myself.\u201d\n\nBut you had to get someone to- nevermind. Olivia looks at me with a hint of disdain, as if she had just read my thoughts, and I feel the energy leave me as we hit another speedbump in the conversation. I can only wish I was better at socialization, then I might be able to talk without patronizing the people I\u2019m with. The next few minutes are relatively quiet, with only the light wind\u2019s howls and the chirping birds to fill the silence. Olivia suddenly stops us, looking towards a particular flower that\u2019s growing alongside the path. It looks yellow, like a cone with the flat side aimed toward the sun. Olivia bends forward and touches one of its leaves lightly, taking care not to shred it with her claws. I decide to break the silence with a question.\n\n\u201cSo what kind of flower is that?\u201d\n\nOlivia turns to me, almost as if she forgot I was here at all. She looks solemn for a moment, but seems to cheer up in time to answer my question. \u201cIt\u2019s a poppy.\u201d My mind can only drift to some internet tabloid I read at some point about how various drugs are made. \u201cCan\u2019t you make opium from those?\u201d Olivia almost snorts, stating, \u201cNo, not *these* ones.\u201d A feeling of relief washes over me as I'm shown positive feedback, and I decide to continue with the topic. I ask, \"So you like poppies?\" She smiles, offering a gentle nod with her reply, \"Yeah. I grow them for my.. dad. It's not too hard.\" Trying to be encouraging, I comment, \"Maybe you can show me sometime.\" Olivia pauses, looking up at me with an expression I can't gauge. Did I say something wrong? Eventually, she turns away, asking me a question I'm not prepared for.\n\n\"You mean, like.. you wanna come to my house?\"\n\nFreezing for few seconds, I have no idea how to respond to the question. My first instinct is that she's teasing me, just like she used to. But the question sounded genuine; Is she inviting me over, or treating the idea like a joke? I don't even consider this a date, does she? How badly am I misreading all of this? I have no idea, but I try to force something out of my mouth for fear of an awkward silence further destabilizing our conversation.\n\n\"W-Well, I mean.. y-\"\n\nSuddenly, I'm interrupted again by a feminine shout that comes from over my shoulder. Both me and Olivia spin around towards the source, and it looks like a yellow dinosaur standing by a large metal cart is beckoning us over. Looking at Olivia, she seems just as confused as I am, but it's almost a blessing in disguise that she interrupted us when she did. I gesture towards the figure and try to gauge Olivia's response. Her skepticism drops, nodding towards me. We both move side by side towards the shouting dinosaur, trying to figure out what they want. Eventually, I get a better look at the person; a feminine dinosaur with a large tail wearing a revealing black tank top and a comically large chef's hat. There's some kind of ring tattoo on one of her arms, but before I can get a better look at it, she demands our attention with her pitch. \"You two, strolling through the park on a summer afternoon? Yer on a date, ain'tcha?\"\n\nMy initial instinct is to deny the accusation, but Olivia, unlike me, doesn't seem to be phased by the teasing of this woman. She fires back quite quickly, locking eyes with her as she replies, \"Yeah, what's it to you?\" My best guess is that Olivia wants her off our backs quickly, but the way she agreed to the question seemed so natural. Suppressing my expression of embarrassment is difficult, but I have time to do so while the two ladies are speaking to one another. The stranger, whom I can only assume is some kind of vendor, offers Olivia a sultry smile. \"Well, everything's twice as better with a few 'dogs, ain't it?\" I'm not feeling particularly hungry, but Olivia turns her head and stares at me. This carries the gaze of the street vendor towards me, both pairs of eyes mounting an increasing amount of pressure on me. Eventually, I croak out the words \"Y-Yeah, two hotdogs, sure.\"\n\nIt doesn't take the vendor long to cook our franks, and Olivia excitedly requests all manner of condiments to go with hers; mustard, ketchup, relish and diced onions. This woman must be a miracle worker, because the bun manages to hold the assortment together, probably with the assistance of the tin foil its wrapped in. There looks to be an area to sit not far ahead of us, and Olivia mentions to me that she'll meet me there when I'm finished. This saddles me with the burden of cost, and my wallet groans at me. When the street vendor asks, I only request ketchup on mine. She eyes me with a hint of disappointment, off-handedly commenting, \"That's it?\" I shrug, content with my simplistic taste. I said I wasn't really hungry, anyway. She hands me the hotdog, and I turn to leave before she speaks up again.\n\n\"So, still courting her?\"\n\nI turn my head, trying to rummage through my mind for a response for the question. I wouldn't call us Romeo and Juliet by any means. In the end, I tell her, \"I'm just trying to help a friend.\" She doesn't seem content with that answer, speaking like she knows me. \"She must be stingy, if you're still not together.\" I can only blink blankly, allowing confused words to tumble from my mouth. \"W-What do you mean? You know about us?\" She giggles like a schoolgirl, despite her apparent age. \"Don't worry about me. You better make a move sooner or later.\" With those words, she starts to pack up her cart. The way she speaks, as if we're old friends, is unnerving enough to render me silent. After paying with a few bills, I decide to go find Olivia and leave the vendor to her own devices. She isn't finished, though; still within earshot, she yells over to me one last time. \"And if she doesn't work out, I'll always be here~\"\n\nRaptor Jesus, save me. I find myself on autopilot down the path, holding the hotdog tightly in one hand as I keep my eyes on the gazebo in front of me. Luckily, no more amorous words strike me from behind, and I find myself calming down as I approach the gazebo where Olivia said she'd be. Already positioned under the awning that protects the area from the sun, she hurriedly motions me over. As I set my tinfoil-wrapped hot dog on the green metal table, Olivia speaks up nervously. \"Hey.. do you think there's anything to drink around here?\" Without an answer to her question, I look around the area and spot a vending machine by a bathroom relatively close by. I turn back to Olivia, and I'm greeted with puppy dog eyes of expectation. My wallet sheds a tear.\n\nBefore long, we're both sat at the green metal table. Olivia, with her deluxe hotdog and off-brand can of soda, and me, with my barebones hotdog and bottle of water. She seems to be waiting for me to eat; I take off the tin foil and bite into the hotdog. To my surprise, it's better than I expected. Olivia certainly seems to agree, based off how she has begun to devour hers. I take a moment to collect myself. Based off of her response to the street vendor's assumption that we were together, I consider a straight forward approach of asking about what exactly we're doing here. I really just wanted to spend time with Olivia, hoping she was still into nature like she was ages ago. Worry leaves my head, and I can't help but stare at her eating unceremoniously with a goofy grin on my face and butterflies forming in my stomach. My absent-minded thought process is broken as I realize we've locked eyes. She breaks the silence before I can look away.\n\n\"You're.. not eating?\"\n\nOh, right. In an act of appeasement, I pick up the hotdog and take another bite of it. She seems to stop eating for a moment while I do so, and I can't help but feel this is the best time to ask her what she meant back at the vendor, if anything.\n\n\"So, uh.. we're on a date?\"\n\nOlivia freezes like a deer in the headlights, looking directly at me for a few seconds. I do the same, hoping the question wasn't inappropriate and steeling myself in the event that she starts shouting at me. I'm almost positive I spot the faintest blush cross her cheeks, but she suddenly snorts, laughing somewhat as she replies.\n\n\"Oh, right. What I told the girl. Dunno, are we?\"\n\nThe perfect deflection leaves Olivia with a teasing smirk and me with all the responsibility of answering the question. I don't have an answer- that's why I asked. I'm the one who invited her here, though, so it makes sense that I'm the arbiter on whether or not this outing is.. romantic. I don't want to dodge the question, but I still haven't figured out my own feelings. Even if I did, would now really be the best time to admit them? The words of encouragement by the street vendor begin to reverberate through my mind; 'You better make a move'. Is it even possible to do that here? As I think, I suddenly receive a hint of inspiration. The kind of exchanges we always used to have, the few times I've managed to make her speechless; the right words echo in my mind.\n\n\"You'll know by the end of the night.\"\n\nThese words, combined with my own uncontrollable smirk, cause Olivia to stop chewing. She swallows and tries to stay something, but stutters in embarrassment. A sense of victory flows through my body as I finally seem to beat her at her own game. I confidently re-shift my focus on eating the hotdog, despite my lack of hunger, only to give Olivia more time to process the statement. However, doubt begins to cloud my mind when I think about what I just said. Is toying with somebody like this affectionate or manipulative? She's done it to me for as long as I can remember, so I'm leaning towards the former, but we've never outwardly suggested being 'together' before. Maybe I just crossed a line. I look back to Olivia, already formulating an apology in my head, but it looks like she just finished. She hurriedly wheels herself towards a bin, tossing both the can and the tin foil into it and facing me.\n\n\"C'mon, hurry up. We've barely looked at anything.\"\n\nI guess the time for apologizing has passed. I stand up, tossing away my garbage as well, and allow Olivia to take the lead this time. Our journey begins once again, this time uninterrupted by street vendors. I notice Olivia always makes an effort to stay ahead of me; not wanting her to tire herself out, I take my time admiring the picturesque view of nature. I can start to understand why Olivia was so into this stuff as a kid; it can either be relaxing or exciting, depending on how you look at it. The hot weather has cooled slightly since we've started walking, leaving a pleasant warmth that envelops my body and keeps me safe. It reminds me of my childhood. Taking in the world like this, pleasant memories mesh with the beautiful atmosphere around me, and I find myself in a state of mellowed euphoria. I lose track of time; before I know it, we're back at the parking lot, having made a full circle from the start of the walk. It's almost disappointing that we've reached the end of the park, but all good things come to an end. Olivia looks content with the trip, so any sense of worry over her leaves my body, and I yawn.\n\n\"That was nice, wasn't it?\"\n\nShe looks at me directly and nods her head. \"Yeah, haven't been out in awhile. Thanks.\" Those words are probably high praise from somebody like her, so I can't help but feel proud of myself. The first step of many; someday, we might be friends like we used to. No sense in rushing things, though. \"Naser'll come get you, right?\", I ask. She nods in reply, and while I still feel bad for getting him roped into this, I have no doubt he's doing it because he wants to. I jokingly suggest to her, \"Maybe we could all hang out one of these days. Y'know, introduce me.\" Olivia just offers me a shrug, not approving of the idea, but not opposing it either. Sighing, I wipe the thought of meeting the guy from my head. Maybe later; he certainly didn't look like he has much free time. I spot my old silver car in the distance, right where I left it. I offer Olivia a smile and wave, letting my last words of the 'date' fill the air. \"See you at work, then.\" I turn around and begin walking towa-\n\n\"Wait.\"\n\nShe says it right as she manages to grab my hand. I pause, turning towards Olivia in surprise. I wouldn't expect her to do something like that. She looks at me with a hard-to-read expression, speaking quietly. \"You said I'd know by the end of the night.\" Recalling my words back at the table, I can only nod, trying to suppress any obvious emotional response. Did she decide? Whatever she's about to say might completely change our relationship. I can't help but swallow my own saliva, hoping that her feelings, in the end, mirror mine; a dice roll is a pathetic way to figure out how you feel about somebody, but it's all I have right now.\n\nInstead of receiving any sort of answer from her, I watch as Olivia's expression shifts into one of borderline malicious taunting.\n\n\n\"Y'know, it won't be night for a couple more hours.\"\n\n\n~END~"},"Catching Butterflies Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Olivia","Catching Butterflies Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"~Catching Butterflies: Chapter Four~\n~AKA I finally fucking learn how to write\/format dialogue properly holy shit this is so much easier to read and write why did it take me so long to do this~\n\nA gentle breeze hits my face, flowing in from the open window of my car. The afternoon has just started to cool down as I drive down a series of roads, instructions eagerly spoken to me by the green dinosaur in the passenger seat. I'm not sure where we're driving, but Olivia refuses to answer whenever I ask. The radio is tuned to a station I've never heard before, the sounds of indie synth-pop filling the silence between Olivia's directions. Any objections to my current situation are shot down when Olivia reminds me of what I said; 'by the end of the night'. Occasionally, when we pass an interesting sight, Olivia tells me to slow down as she admires it. The only thing I get to admire over the course of the trip are the break lights of the cars in front of me; I forgot how bad people are at driving in this town. Lucky her. For a moment I find myself regretting getting into this mess, but the energy from Olivia is almost infectious, and I find myself excited for whatever she has planned. I turn the volume of the radio up by one notch, and try to enjoy the moment without crashing my car.\n\nEventually, Olivia has me turn onto a road that I recognize. I think about where we could possibly be going, but I genuinely don't know. Eventually, she snaps her fingers next to my face and points out of the window.\n\n\"There.\" My eyes follow her hand, and she's pointing to, of all places, Volcano High. The high school we both attended looks completely empty; no surprise, schools in the summer tend to be empty. Still, I can't help but turn to Olivia.\n\n\"Really? Volcano High?\" I say, my bored tone easily identifiable. She looks at me in return, snorting.\n\n\"Dude, trust me. Just park the car.\" Olivia replies, and I sigh. Even though I didn't expect to come back here anytime soon, I follow Olivia's instructions and pull into the empty high school parking lot, finding a space closest to the building. Shifting the car into park, I turn the radio off and pull my keys from the ignition, offering one last look of apprehension to Olivia. She rolls her eyes, motioning me to step out of the car.\n\n\"C'mon, don't look at me like that. Go get the chair.\" Olivia's words are playful, which eases my fears slightly, but I still can't help but move reluctantly.\n\nI open the door of my car, stepping out and closing it firmly before walking towards my trunk. I rarely use it, so I have to fiddle around with the keys for an abnormally long amount of time before I manage to get it to pop open. I grab the chair, lugging it out and sitting it on the ground before trying to figure out how this thing unfolds. I remember watching Naser do the exact same thing, and I mentally kick myself for not remembering how exactly he did it. One full minute of pulling, pushing, folding and locking later, I've managed to set up the chair. I close the trunk of my car, rolling it towards the passenger seat and the likely pissed Olivia.\n\nAs I open the passenger door of my car, I'm greeted with a very bored looking green dinosaur. Olivia looks almost disappointed, and I put on my best faux smile, pretending like nothing was out of the ordinary.\n\n\"So.. how do I get you in?\" I ask in a nonchalant tone. Olivia rolls her eyes.\n\n\"Just.. grab my arm, okay?\" she replies, reaching out to me with her right arm. I grab her forearm tightly as she grips the disability handle on the inside of the car with her other hand. It takes some serious lifting on both of our parts, but we eventually get her seated properly. Olivia adjusts herself in the chair, rolling away from the door. I step forward to shut it, turning around to where she just moved and looking at her with a blank expression. She stares at me, as well, as if waiting for me to say something. Nothing comes to mind, however, so I just.. look around awkwardly.\n\n\"What are we waiting for?\" Olivia asks, as if expecting me to move first. I stutter a sound of approval, beginning to walk towards the high school building; Olivia follows me side-by-side. \n\nWe reach the sidewalk that surrounds the building, but Olivia goes the opposite way from the main doors; I follow suit, still confused as to where exactly we're going. Eventually, we reach a set of side doors that, if I recall correctly, lead into the band room. They usually keep these doors locked, especially at night. I turn to Olivia.\n\n\"I'm.. pretty sure these doors are gonna be-\" My words are interrupted as Olivia waves a hand dismissively towards me as she digs into her pocket. After a few moments, she pulls something out; two keys attached to a metal ring.\n\n\"W-Where did you get those?\" I ask. Olivia looks at me, a proud and mischievous smile crossing her face.\n\n\"Took them off the janitor's belt the last day of school. Figured they'd come in handy someday.\" She says, spinning the key on one of her claws. I can't help but laugh a little.\n\nOlivia wheels herself towards the doors, placing a key inside the keyhole and turning it. She struggles to open the door, eventually trying to turn the key the other way. This seems to work; a satisfying click echoes from the door before she pulls it open; I remember briefly how much I struggled with doors like these only a few months ago, and silently admire Olivia's upper body strength. She motions me in, and I grab the door, letting her roll her way inside and stepping in afterward. The metal door shuts behind us, and we stand in the band room; it looks like this place was cleaned up since the end of the school year. The desks are stacked in a corner of the room, and very few posters remain on the walls. Olivia doesn't seem to be interested in the room as much as I am, though; she wheels herself toward the doors that lead further into the school, looking at me expectantly. I can't help but try to make conversation.\n\nI begin to monologue, \"So.. music, huh. I never did well in this class, especially during the live performance stuff. Guess I'm better off listening, not playing.\" Olivia looks towards me, sighing and wheeling away from the doors slightly.\n\n\"I never paid much attention, but I could play the drums, so I did alright.\" She says, casually. I can't help but raise a brow; I had no idea Olivia could play any instruments.\n\n\"Where'd you learn drums? Were you in a band?\" I ask. Olivia snorts at the latter half of that question, and she looks off into the distance, as if recalling hazy memories.\n\n\"Naser knew a guy, Reed. I wanted to be in a band, but Reed's band didn't want me, so I never really-\" Suddenly, Olivia stops, and her explanatory expression is replaced with an uncontrollable smile as she intentionally avoids looking at me. Curiosity burns in my heart, and I remain silent in the hopes that she'll continue.\n\n\"W-Well, technically I was.\" She says, as if remembering better days. \"But there's not much you can do with just a Casio and a drum set.\"\n\nI can't help but laugh quietly, smiling as I share in her pleasant memories. \"If I ever learn to play the guitar or something, I'll let you know.\"\n\nOlivia looks at me sheepishly, quietly stating, \"That.. Yeah, that'd be cool.\"\n\nOur words linger in the air for several seconds, and the silence quickly becomes awkward. I swallow to clear my throat, and Olivia begins to wheel her chair around back towards the doors that lead into the hallways of Volcano High.\n\n\"A-Anyway, c'mon. There's more stuff to check out.\" She says, pulling the door open, and I find myself speed-walking towards the door to try and stay caught up with her. \n\nWe exit the band room and stand in the darkened hallway, the only light coming from windows that only occasionally dot the hallway. It's enough to easily make out where we're going, though, and I follow as Olivia takes the lead. I look at the assortment of lockers as we pass them, remembering what they looked like on the last day of high school; adorned with farewell messages, each one personalized by whoever owned it. I can barely remember the words themselves, and chances are they were generic, but the sentimental memory of that last day forces me to smile as I continue to walk with Olivia. I notice she's doing the same; looking around the hall as we move down it, likely recalling memories of our final days of high school. Whether they were good or bad, I wasn't sure; dinosaurs are hard to read sometimes.\n\nEventually, we reach the cafeteria. The doors are unlocked, and I opt to open them for Olivia this time. She looks at me as I do this, almost disgruntled, before reluctantly wheeling herself through the door. I guess she doesn't like it when I help her. Either way, we stand inside the cafeteria, and I wander over to the old lunch schedule that still hangs on the wall. They really went all-out for the last month; most of the food items were discounted as a form of appreciation to the student body. My wallet was particularly happy that month. Looking back towards Olivia, I see she's wheeled herself to the center of the cafeteria, looking up and out of the large glass panes that cover one of the cafeteria walls. I move closer to her to do the same; the sun isn't visible from here, but the afternoon sky looks nice. I've always liked the sky; I can only imagine what it'll look like tonight. Maybe I'll get to watch it with Olivia.\n\n\"You remember when that food fight started, the day when they were serving meatball subs?\" Olivia asks me, laughing to herself as she recalls the incident. I very quickly remember what she's talking about; I never sat in the middle of the cafeteria, so I didn't see a whole lot, but one day the football team and soccer teams kept heckling each other until somebody threw a meatball. Both teams started hurling them, and the rest of the cafeteria quickly joined in. Principal Spears had to scream at everyone to get them to sit down, and both teams had to clean the cafeteria until it was spotless.\n\n\"Yeah.. Yeah, I do. That was great.\" I say, nodding in affirmation to Olivia's question. \n\nI almost wish I got involved in more wacky shenanigans like that; it certainly would've made high school more interesting than it was. But now's not the time to regret anything. I look straight at Olivia, and she returns the gaze. Even though we've both graduated already, I still have tonight to make my most important high school memory. I watch Olivia turn away, a slight blush covering her face.\n\n\"W-What are you looking at?\" She asks, and I barely register that I've just been staring at her for several seconds. Clearing my throat, I stutter out the word \"N-Nothing.\" before taking a final gaze around the cafeteria and shrugging.\n\n\"So.. where to next?\" I ask. Olivia ponders the question for a few moments.\n\n\"How about the auditorium?\" She asks me. I see no reason to refute the suggestion, so I nod along, and Olivia motions me to follow her as she wheels towards the exit of the cafeteria. \n\nThe cafeteria isn't far from the auditorium, so it doesn't take us long to get there; the walk is relatively quiet. Once we reach the auditorium doors, I let Olivia go in first, grabbing the door as she enters and following in behind her. Rows upon rows of folded seats extend nearly the entire length of the room, except for a small gap between the chairs and the stage. We approach the stage, finding it the most interesting thing in the room. As I stare at the stage, I'm blindsided by memories of Fang's first performance in this room. The cacophony of laughter that filled the room echoes in my mind, and I slow to a stop as guilt grasps my heart. Olivia notices this, turning herself around and looking at me with a questioning expression.\n\n\"You, uh.. you alright?\" She asks. I blink, nodding my head and trying to clear the thought from my head as I start walking again. Olivia looks almost sad, but she turns around and we continue until we reach the stage. I look at the staircase, realizing there may be a slight problem.\n\n\"Olivia, I don't think-\" My words are interrupted by the dinosaur.\n\n\"Look under the stage, moron.\" Olivia's words sting a bit, but I follow her instructions and notice some kind of metal ramp sitting under it. I look back towards Olivia, and she motions me to pull it out. Using my herculean (I wish) strength, I lurch the metal ramp out from under the stage. It's relatively straight forward to use, and I raise the platform until it's level with the stage floor. Olivia rolls her way up the ramp, with a small amount of difficulty. I re-adjust the ramp once she's done, pushing it back in and opting to take the stairs at the edge of the stage. Soon enough, we're both standing under the dim stage lights that, for some reason or another, haven't been turned off.\n\nOlivia takes the lead again, wheeling towards the large curtain and moving it aside as she moves backstage. I follow her, and soon enough we're standing in an even more dim backstage area. There are some leftover set pieces that sit at the edge of the backstage area, likely from the spring play that was performed only a few months prior. I didn't attend, so I don't remember the theme, but it looks like it was nature-oriented based on the woodland backdrop and some of the props.\n\nSpeaking of props, Olivia has wheeled herself over to a bin that contains many, many props from the play. She laughs as she digs through them, and I approach her side to peer into the chest as well. As I reach her, Olivia pulls out a plastic banana from the bin, looking up and handing it to me.\n\n\"Here, I think this belongs to you.\" She says, a large smirk covering her face. I purse my lips briefly, but the vaguely offensive joke only serves to make me laugh rather than invoke any sort of negative feeling from me.\n\n\"Yum.\" I utter, accepting the gift. Olivia giggles briefly before scrounging through the bin once again. I don't see anything of interest in it from a glance, so I opt to look around again. My eyes find themselves looking up toward the scaffolding that lines the roof of the backstage, likely for maintenance to reach lights and fixtures. I tap Olivia on the shoulder, and she looks at me as I point up to it.\n\n\"You wanna head up there?\" I ask, playfully. Olivia remains silent for a few seconds, and a growing concern fills me as I realize the potential for my statement to upset her. Instead, though, she just snorts.\n\n\"Good one, monkey.\" She says, and I look back to the banana that still rests within my hand. I place it back into the bin, and look to Olivia once more; it looks like she's lost in thought right now, though I'm unsure about what.\n\n\"The roof.\" She utters to herself, eventually turning to me and saying the same thing much louder.\n\n\"The roof! We should go to the roof! A-Apparently the view is really nice.\" She states, trying to justify her suggestion. I smirk, shrugging.\n\n\"Yeah.. the roof sounds fun.\" I say, and Olivia seems to genuinely smile in response. \n\nWe leave the backstage area through a set of doors in the back, taking a small hallway back to the main hall of the high school. A small disability elevator that I completely forgot exists rests along a staircase that leads back to the main hall, and Olivia rolls her way onto it, using a key from the keyring she supposedly stole to turn it on and slowly deposit her on the floor of the main hall. I take the stairs, which takes a much shorter amount of time; Olivia shows a hint of disdain at this, but doesn't say a word. She continues to lead me through the main hall, and eventually we reach a proper elevator; one that'll take us up to the second floor. Olivia's elevator key also works on this elevator, and as the elevator doors open, we step inside the compact space. Olivia uses a claw to push the [2] button, and the doors close before taking us up.\n\nWe're spit out onto the second floor of the high school, and Olivia exists first, rolling her way down the hall. I step out as well, but I can't help but ask-\n\n\"O-Olivia, wait!\" I say, and she turns her head back towards me with a quizzical expression.\n\n\"If the elevator doesn't go to the roof, how are we-\" I'm cut off, yet again, by Olivia.\n\n\"Don't worry about it. Just.. follow me.\" She says, avoiding the problem entirely and pressing onwards. I can't help but sigh as I follow her from behind.\n\nEventually, we reach the Roof access doors. Olivia uses her staff key to unlock this door, as well; the steel door is pushed open to reveal a concrete landing and a set of stairs that lead up to a second landing; I can only assume the roof door is right above us. Olivia wheels onto the landing, and I join her, completely unsure of what exactly is about to happen. She stares at the staircase, sighing deeply.\n\n\"Okay. I can do this.\" She mutters to herself, and I remain silent in confusion.\n\nOlivia wheels right to the base of the staircase, cracking her knuckles as she reaches out to the railing and grabs it firmly. She tugs herself out of the wheelchair entirely, using the railing as a support as she uses just her upper body to pull herself up the staircase. I'm genuinely amazed she can even get up the first few stairs like this; It looks like hell to even try something like that. My concern for her well-being causes me to call out.\n\n\"O-Olivia, I don't think that's a good-\" My words are cut off by Olivia yet again.\n\n\"Just.. shut up, I can-\" Olivia continues to do her best to drag herself up the staircase, reaching the halfway point between this landing and the next. I continue to watch her struggle, not having any clue what the hell to do. She doesn't make it much further before she lowers herself onto the staircase in a sitting position, panting as sweat beads at her forehead.\n\n\"O-Okay, I need a break.\" Olivia says between her breaths. As she recovers, I have time to think about what to say to her. The only words I can come up with probably won't help the situation.\n\n\"Olivia, you don't need to do this.\" I say with a concerned tone, hoping to convince her down. She turns her head, looking back up the stairs, and sighs to herself as she lowers her head.\n\nAfter several seconds, she looks back up at me and speaks in a reluctant tone. \"A-Alright, fine. You can help. Just.. let me have your shoulder with one arm, and I'll-\"\n\nI cut the dinosaur off, an unintended sternness filling my voice as I try to justify my position. \"No, Olivia. We *don't* have to do this. W-What if you fall? Getting down is going to be even harder, I'm not going to risk you getting hurt.\" \n\nOlivia stares at me, her eyes unwavering, for an eerily long time. She looks genuinely bewildered, as if she didn't expect for a second that I wouldn't agree to this. I stare back at her, awaiting some form of response, and eventually I do get one. Olivia's expression shifts to one of pain, then to one of contempt, then to one of outright anger over the span of just a few seconds.\n\n\"What? Even- W- You know what? Fuck you.\"\n\nOlivia's words cut into me, and I'm left standing in the same bewilderment that I just inflicted upon her. Not in a million years would I expect outright hostility from her, but I watch her move in frustration as she tries to lower herself down the staircase again. \n\nI immediately regret my words. There's a thousand better ways I could've worded what I said, and a familiar feeling of guilt courses through my soul. Hoping to make up for it, I take the first step up the staircase and offer her a hand. \"H-Here, let me-\" \n\nOlivia pulls away from me, raising an arm to physically shield herself. \"DON'T- touch me.\"\n\nI instinctively take a few steps back, in fear of upsetting her any more than I already have. I can only watch as she struggles to lower herself down the stairs, slowly getting closer and closer to her wheelchair. After a great deal of effort and strength on her part, Olivia manages to grab onto her wheelchair and pull herself onto it, adjusting her position to be seated normally. She looks at me one last time, a furrowed brow that expresses a million and one negative emotions. She looks away as she wheels back through the door and off of the landing. I can't help but follow her, watching her roll herself back toward the elevator down the hall as I stand next to the roof access door.\n\n\"O-Olivia, wait! I didn't mean to..\" My own words trail off; I don't even know what I didn't mean to do. I watch helplessly as Olivia reaches the elevator, calling it. The doors open, and she looks at me one last time with a contemptuous expression.\n\n\"I'm going home.\"\n\nOlivia wheels herself into the elevator, and I watch the doors close with a thud as it descends.\n\n\n\nWhat the hell just happened? Over the span of a single minute, I managed to completely ruin the whole night for both of us. I continue to stand on the second floor, motionless, with no idea of what to do. I don't want to make things worse, so I'm not going to chase after her. The loneliness of the darkened high school hallway begins to set in, and I suddenly feel cold; Rather than pleasant nostalgia, the environment of the high school serves to assault me with memories of harassment and judgement. What is wrong with me? Why did she get so upset when I said I didn't want her to get hurt?\n\nYeah, why DID she? What kind of person throws a childish fit over someone caring about them? Who in their right mind would try to climb a set of stairs without using their legs, and then start whining when they can't? I'm not the problem, SHE is. This flash of anger temporarily overtakes my feelings of loneliness and misery, inspiring me to start moving again. I walk towards the staircase that connects the first and second floor, descending as aggressive thoughts turn my body on autopilot. I don't need this. I'm just going to go home. Olivia must've headed towards the main doors, so I leave through the glass cafeteria doors, coming out at the side of the school and looking out over the field. A gentle breeze hits my skin, and I feel slightly more calm. I spend about a minute standing here, taking in the sight and letting the peaceful wind carry away my troubles. As my frustration subsides, I can only worry about Olivia; she can't go home alone, so I should make sure she's okay. \n\nI begin walking, and it doesn't take long before I've rounded the corner of the building and stare at the main entrance. I stop as soon as I spot Olivia; She's currently waiting on the sidewalk in front of the school, staring at her phone. Propping myself up against the wall, I wait. My temptation to run up to her, to apologize for what happened, is overshadowed by my fears of making things worse. If she even knew I was here right now, she'd probably call the police. Over the course of the next eleven minutes, nothing happens. Neither of us move an inch. I watch a familiar damaged sports car roll up to the front of the school, and out of the driver's side door comes Naser. They barely speak as Naser helps the woman into his car, and it's not long before they drive off together. I silently wish I was as good of a friend as he was.\n\nI turn around, beginning to walk back toward the parking lot where my old car is. There's nothing else to do today, other than go home and waste away the evening. Walking down the path leading to the parking lot, I take the time to look around more than I did when we first arrived. The gardening club's handiwork is on display at the edges of the path, taunting me with the pleasant memories that Olivia and I shared earlier in the day. I can't help but be disappointed; the sight of flowers and the presence of nature has been almost tainted for me, the desire to ignore the plants and keep walking afflicting me with intensity. One flower in the garden catches my eye, though. I stop moving, crouching down to get a better look at it. It looks yellow, like a cone with the flat side aimed toward the sky. I grab the flower by its base, picking it from the ground and standing back up. Rubbing the stem between my fingers, I can't help but feel a smile tug at my face.\n\nIt's a yellow poppy.\n\n\n~END~"},"Wheel Of Fortune.txt":{"path":["Olivia","Wheel Of Fortune.txt"],"text":"Title: Wheel Of Fortune\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Olivia, Fang, Trish, Reed, Naomi and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Pshy\n\n\nI tapped my foot impatiently, just my luck to get called to the principals office first thing in the morning. I didn't even know what this was about! I hadn't torrented that much using the schools bandwidth and it's not like I was bullying anyone after Trish's little stunt. The thought still made my blood boil, some days I wonder if I did the right thing by forgiving her. I sighed as I let my anger cool, I only did it for Fang anyways, keep doing it for her. Maybe I was getting called in about being bullied? The students at Volcano High weren't very physical with their bullying but I was starting to seriously get sick of cleaning my locker of dicks and hentai. Why did the normies that bully people over anime even know that Boku No Pico exists? I didn't get time to wonder as Principal Spears finally opened the door to his office and ushered me in.\n\nStepping into the office I saw a girl I'd never seen before already here. She was the same shade of lime green as Stella though her hair was darker and matted. Not that her physical appearance was as striking as the wheel chair she sat in or the cast that her arm was wrapped in. Surprisingly she didn't react at all to my entrance, staring straight ahead at the Principals empty seat. Principal Spears sat down and gestured to the last remaining seat, next to the strange girl. I didn't exactly want to be suplexed into a car so I took it despite my confusion.\n\n\"I'm sure you're wondering why I called you here.\" Principal spears intoned ominously.\n\n\"Uh, yeah actually. I really hope this doesn't involve more gardening\" I admitted tentatively, Rosa's great and all but the woman's a slave driver.\n\nSpears thankfully shook his head.\n\n\"As you can see, Olivia here has suffered an injury on campus and due to her situation this impedes her ability to get to class.\" His tone was even but there was a dangerous undercurrent to it, Spears was absolutely livid and I silently thank Raptor Jesus that it's not directed at me.\n\n\"So you want me to give her a hand?\" I ventured, sensing the direction this was going.\n\n\"Precisely.\" He replied with a nod of his head. \"I don't have any staff to spare and you're someone that I trust. I believe you two might have more in common than you think.\" Spears let a small smile grace his features.\n\nThe girl, Olivia, finally looked at me but rather than say anything she just stared at me suspiciously. Spears was handing me a paper with her schedule on it when I finally realized just what he said.\n\n\"Wait, you trust me?\" I couldn't keep the shock from my voice.\n\n\"You've changed a lot since we've first met.\" Was that pride in his voice? \"Not the least of which is your taste if the logs are to be believed.\" Even despite the glasses I could feel the judgmental look he gave me.\n\nI coughed nervously, \"You know what, class is about to start! Ready to go Olivia?\"\n\nThe girl in question grunted and I took hold of her chair, making an escape before Spears could threaten me with anything else. Wheeling her down the halls I finally took a look through her schedule when I noticed something that would help break the ice\n\n\"Oh hey, you share a homeroom with Naser\" I tried to act nonchalant.\n\nOlivia took the bait, \"You know Naser?\" Her voice was a little gruff, like she hadn't used it in a while.\n\n\"Oh yeah, he's my girlfriends brother. Was my first friend at school too.\" I let a little enthusiasm creep into my voice, Naser was an absolute bro. If things with Fang kept going this well then maybe he actually would be my bro.\n\n\"Mine too\" was all she said.\n\nWe walked in silence for a few minutes, Spears said that we had something in common. Based on how little she was talking I was willing to bet she also wanted to ghost through school, just like I did. The end of the year was looming so she was pretty close to accomplishing her goals. I didn't want to imagine a timeline where I actually succeeded in my attempt. Someone should give her a little nudge, guess that someone was me. \n\n\"So, did he share his sandwich with you too?\" I joked\n\n\"No.\" She replied, curt as ever\n\n\"But you said you guys are friends right? What do you two talk about?\" I was genuinely curious, Naser was big into sports wasn't he? I don't think he and Olivia had a shared interest there.\n\nShe was quiet for a while, I thought about prodding her but I had long ago learned it was best to stay silent in these moments.\n\n\"We don't talk much. Just the one thing we have in common.\" She admitted a little hesitantly\n\n\"Oh, what's that?\" \n\n\"Being fucked up.\" She practically spat the words out \"he's the only one in the school that understands.\" her tone growing bitter, I couldn't blame her but...\n\nBut we had arrived at her homeroom, I parked her in class and gave her a wave goodbye that she didn't return. Once I left her classroom I let out a sigh and ran my hand over my head. How to go about this? Maybe I should talk to Naser? Unfortunately I didn't have time to do that since escorting Olivia hadn't relieved me of needing to go to my own class. Jogging through the halls to get there I couldn't help but cringe as some people shouted at me to 'do the naruto run', god fucking damnit Trish. Thankfully the people in my homeroom didn't mock me for the weebery exposed in the slideshow. Possibly because the homeroom teacher was a bigger weeb than I was, why the hell did he talk like that when he clearly wasn't japanese? \n\n\"Why hello there Anon!\" A horrifyingly chipper voice sounded right behind me.\n\n\"Hello to you too, Naomi\" I responded warily, we never really talked before and I especially wasn't eager to start after learning about her plan with Fang.\n\n\"So I couldn't help but notice you pushing Olivia around! How very noble of you!\" The nectarine nightmare said, her plastic smile looked uncomfortable.\n\n\"Yeah, Principal Spears asked me to do it.\" Maybe telling her it was official business would get her off my back.\n\n\"That's wonderful to hear! I asked him to do it after all! Maybe you could introduce her to all your other friends?\" The orchid oppressor was behind all this?\n\nMy suspicion had doubled, the last time Naomi had tried this she had sort of master plan.\n\n\"What are you getting at Naomi?\" I asked directly, eyes narrowed.\n\n\"Why, nothing! Naser kept asking me to arrange for some handicap accessible ramps that just aren't in the budget for a single student, maybe if she had friends to help her then she wouldn't need them.\" How did she manage to be so evil while sounding so happy?\n\n\"Besides That poor girl just isn't very popular you know, Some bullies pushed her down the stairs even! Maybe if she had some friends that wouldn't happen again?\" Her omnipresent smile never faltered. \n\n\"Did you just admit what I think you did?\" I was utterly flabbergasted, this was a new low even for her.\n\n\"I didn't admit anything silly! Good luck with Olivia!\" The coral cunt just walked back to her carefully crafted group of friends without waiting for a reply. \n\nHomeroom came and went with me barely noticing, shell shocked as I was. Holy fucking shit Naomi. I grabbed my things and headed out the door in a daze. While heading to Olivia's homeroom I caught the attention of a certain monochromatic weirdo who was quite surprised to see me. I gave her a a half hearted wave when she started jogging over to meet me.\n\n\"What are you doing in this part of the school? Miss me that much, huh?\" Her grin was cocky as ever\n\n\"Uh... No, sorry Fang. Spears has me helping another student\" I mumbled, my mind still back in homeroom.\n\nShe picked up on my mood quickly, concern clear in her voice \"Hey, is everything alright? Was it the anime thing again?\"\n\nI shook my head, should I tell her? Even Fang might find this hard to believe. \"No, it's just... I realized I REALLY hate Naomi.\" \n\nShe actually bust out laughing. \"Ha! Welcome to the club.\" Even with the worry in my stomach I couldn't help but chuckle too.\n\n\"Well as club president I guess I have to help you out.\" She tried to sound serious but failed to stop giggling. \"Where's this mysterious student?\"\n\nI fished out Olivia's schedule and showed it to Fang. \"She seems a little lonely, wanna help me cheer her up?\" I asked hopefully\n\nShe pretended to think about it. \"Hm... I dunno, What's in it for me?\" \n\nI leaned over and planted my lips on her snout, smiling when I saw her cheeks redden\n\n\"How about more of those?\" I offered, already knowing the answer\n\n\"A-Alright dweeb, you made your point.\" She stammered, her wings ruffled in embarrassment\n\nWith Fang at my side I felt a little better, I would have been thankful for Naomi setting us up if not for the fact that she was a god damned sociopath. \n\nI got to Olivia's homeroom late enough that everyone had left by the time I got there. She barely glanced my way but her eyes locked onto Fang. Did they know each other?\n\n\"So you're the one who's been trying to steal my boyfriend\" Fang stuck her tongue out playfully\n\nMy heart warmed hearing those words but Olivia stared at her completely deadpan, Swing and a miss then. \n\nFang looked a little unsure on how to react to somebody that completely ignored her so I stepped in.\n\n\"Olivia, this is Fang. Naser's sister.\" I offered helpfully, she seemed to respect him.\n\n\"I know.\" was her emotionless reply, she was still staring at Fang.\n\n\"So you know my brother then?\" Fang asked diplomatically\n\nOlivia ignored her \"Stop treating Naser like shit, Fang.\" \n\nBoth Fang and I were stunned at the blatant demand. I wanted to intervene but Fang was a big girl, I trusted her.\n\nFang looked at Olivia with new eyes, the two of them stared at each other for a bit before Fang finally broke silence between them.\n\n\"Yeah, I know. We... Talked recently. Thanks to Anon.\" She glanced my way, that smile of hers was worth the world. Olivia actually looked at me as well, was that appreciation? I don't think I've seen her express emotion until now.\n\nI glanced at the clock, no more time for heart to hearts. Hurrying over to grab Olivia's chair I Wheeled her out of there in record time. Fang needed to get to her own class and waved us goodbye or at least waved Olivia goodbye, she returned the kiss I gave her earlier. When I tried to inform her that interest had accrued in the time it took her to pay me back she threatened to declare bankruptcy, Fearing an economic crash I absolved her of her debt. She was a wily investor but I'll get her next time. Maybe it was my imagination but I could have sworn I saw Olivia smile at our antics. It was hard to tell when her snout hid her jaw so well, come to think of it she didn't look quite like anyone else at school. I tried not to dwell on it as I wheeled her through the halls, she may have been a bit of a character but at least she looked original.\n\nAfter delivering Olivia I was left with dawdling through my next class. I hadn't managed to make many friends and thanks to Trish I was on my own outside of science, music and math. At least today I had Olivia to think about, I really hated doing what Naomi wanted me to do but like any good manipulator she wanted me to do what I was going to do anyways. For once I really wished my social circle was wider, maybe if she's into music I could introduce her to Reed or Trish? Fortunately class didn't take too long and there was science to look forward too next, had to get Olivia first though. \n\nWhen I stepped into her classroom she actually gave me a little wave, wow, this girl had some big talons. As I walked over to her and grabbed the chair handles I had to wonder who was brave enough to push her down stairs when she had claws like those. Naomi practically admitted it but she was never hands on with these things, she must have recruited someone else. As I wheeled her out of the classroom though the weirdness of it was starting to itch my brain. We seemed to have achieved some kind of rapport, she wouldn't mind if I just asked, right?\n\n\"So Olivia, I hope you dont mind the question but what exactly are you?\" I asked hesitantly, could have worded that better.\n\nOlivia looked back at me, her expression unreadable. Oh god, I messed up. I should apologize.\n\n\"Sorry Oli-\" I sputtered but Olivia cut me off.\n\n\"Don't worry about it, I know I'm different from any girl you've ever met.\" She muttered and looked forward again.\n\n\"Oh?\" I sensed a follow up\n\n\"Yeah.\" She nodded \"Cuz I'm the worst one!\" Her tone took a 180 and she started cackling.\n\nI couldn't stop the snort of amusement from escaping me but rather than get upset Olivia only laughed harder when she realized her joke landed. Definitely didn't expect something like that from her.\n\n\"Alright, you got me. I didn't expect that\" I smiled, shaking my head. \n\nWell if she was cracking jokes then that was a good sign. There was something familiar about that brand of humor but I couldn't place my finger on it. Looking for more conversation starters I glanced her over, Plain backpack and simple clothes. No pins in her hair and no blemishes aside from a band-aid and some bruises from her fall. Wait a minute.. Was she wearing slippers? Were those designs what I thought they were? Did she actually know what those meant or did she just pick them up in some strange thrift store? Hm, What's a good way to go about this without revealing my power level?\n\nI coughed to get her attention, \"You watch the news, Olivia?\" \n\n\"Nah.\" She didn't sound very interested.\n\n\"Oh, it's just. I saw this thing about the hacker known as 4chan.\" Yeah, that sounded good.\n\nOlivia thought about it for a moment. \n\n\"What did you say your name was again?\" she asked\n\nWell that was embarrassing, I don't think I ever gave it to her.\n\n\"You've got the one and only Anon Y. Mous as your chauffeur!\" I tried my best to play it cool\n\n\"Fuck off is that your name.\" She immediately replied, disbelief clear in her voice\n\n\"What's wrong with my name?\" I tried not to sound upset, it was a good name!\n\nShe just snickered, what the hell was wrong with it?\n\n\"Stop being cringe and hurry up already, Anon\" \n\nChecking my phone I realized she was right, we did need to hurry. I was going to be late for sure but I had a pretty good excuse, I bet Farnsworth wouldn't even notice. I said my goodbyes with Olivia and rushed over to class, eager to meet up with Fang again. Fortunately it was another day of partners which let me talk with sweet tooth as much as I wanted. Unsurprisingly we both ended up talking about Olivia, Fang seemed amenable to the idea of letting her hang with us at lunch. That just left Reed and Trish in math, until then it was time to figure out why the hell chelicerae were important to our education.\n\nOlivia and I didn't actually talk much after I retrieved her. I'd made some good progress with her already, I didn't want to force anything. Olivia was an introverted soul through and through, she seemed quite content listening only to the squeak of her wheels and the ambient chatter of the students us. Turns out she shared her next class with Naser too, he smiled and waved when he saw me wheel Olivia in. Unfortunately Mr. Carldewskii was either incredibly lax or incredibly strict and I wasn't willing to risk his ire so I couldn't stop to catch up with him. Unfortunately when I got to math I realized that was all pointless, Mr. Carldewskii was fast asleep at his desk. The man had his porn mag shielding his eyes as he snored, 'XXXTRA FAT TAILS AND SNOUTS' was lettered bold and pink on the cover. How on earth did this guy stay employed?\n\nThankfully that meant I got to talk to Trish and Reed about Olivia, Reed was as enthusiastic as you might expect. I'm really not sure why Reed hung out with us, the guy oozed charisma so how did he end up in the unpopular circle? It was fortunate that was the case though, I was counting on that charisma to work on Olivia. Trish put up the most resistance to the idea, of course she did, but seeing as she was outvoted 3 to 1 she had to put up with it. Democracy fucking sucks when it's actually democratic, ain't that right Trish?\n\nThe bell rung when I was in the middle of convincing Reed that bunny hopping in rock ring was grounds for murder. We normally walked to the cafeteria together but I had a certain, uh, whatever she was to go fetch. When I stepped into Olivia's room she was staring out a window, a small smile on her face. She was rapidly clacking her talons to the beat of music heard only in her head, I almost didn't want to interrupt. That toothy smile of hers didn't fade when she saw me, It was hard not to smile too. \n\n\"You up for having lunch with me and my friends, Olivia?\" I asked hopefully, grabbing her chair and heading to the cafeteria.\n\n\"You realize I literally can't move without you, right?\" was her non-committal response.\n\n\"Well, I didn't know if you had a place to liked to sit or maybe with Naser or...\" I started to ramble\n\nOlivia's face darkened. \"I like Naser but not enough to put up with Naomi\" she said, vitriol oozing from her voice when she mentioned Naomi\n\nI couldn't help but chuckle despite her anger, \"I think you'll get along with us just fine.\" \n\nActually getting our lunch took a little longer than usual but once we acquired our prison food masquerading as something edible I headed us off towards the auditorium. \n\n\"You realize we're leaving the cafeteria, right?\" She mentioned once we were past the doors\n\n\"Yeah, but we're cool guys who have a special hang out spot\" I reassured her\n\n\"You mean you're segregated losers?\" She countered lazily\n\n\"Yep!\" I replied cheerily \"but us losers have a projector and movies\"\n\nShe seemed enthused at that, fortunately it wasn't a long walk to the auditorium. Pushing open the doors had all three of my friends turn their heads. Wheeling her over we got our introductions out of the way, they went quickly but Olivia seemed a little out of her element. Maybe this was too many people at once? Thankfully I know just the thing to get the ball rolling.\n\n\"What song were you banging out before lunch, Olivia?\" I asked between mouthfuls of cardboard pizza.\n\nSure enough, all three members of the Fang Gang had their interest piqued, lets hope the new girl had some good taste.\n\n\"Oh, uh, you know it was.. Dragonforce\" her voice waned until she practically squeaked out the name.\n\n\"Woah! That's a sick song, You gotta have some rythm!\" Reed piped up enthusiastically\n\n\"I... Guess?\" Olivia clearly didn't receive compliments often\n\n\"Yeah man! I'm a drummer for VVURM DRAMA, I know these things.\" He slid an arm around her shoulders like they had been friends for years\n\n\"Plus\" He continued, pointing to her biceps \"those guns you got? You'd be a sick drummer.\" \n\nOlivia's eyes widened and her cheeks reddened, I don't think she was used to people being physical with her let alone boys. \n\n\"S-so you said something about VVURM drama?\" Olivia stammered out, eager to change the subject\n\nWell that did it, Suddenly everyone was invested now. Fang pulled out some sheet music, asking her about the lyrics and sound boarding variations with her. Reed was going tapping out some of their songs for Olivia, still invested in getting her into drums it seems. Even Trish was involved, showing the overwhelmed girl all the merchandise she apparently carried on her just in case. Unfortunately I didn't have much to add here but I was just pleased to have everything work out. Olivia eventually accepted that she wasn't going to keep up but it was still going well, until she broke off her pizza and held it out to her backpack. The room was suddenly consumed with two distinctly different but very girly screams.\n\n\"WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT!?\" Trish shrieked and stumbled backwards\n\n\"IT'S SO CUTE!\" Fang squealed, her hands moving to her cheeks\n\nThe cause of it all was a small rat perched on the lip of Olivia's backpack, Nibbling on the small slice of cardboard pizza handed to it. Why the hell did she have that? Did Spears know? \n\n\"Ohmygosh, what's his name?\" Fang cooed, I've never seen her like this before.\n\n\"Uh, Guts?\" Olivia answered uncertainly\n\nReed tore off a large chunk of pizza and handed it to guts, the rat dropped the bite sized portion and immediately grabbed the oversized piece. \n\n\"That thing was too big to be called pizza, too thick, too heavy, too rough\" Reed started chuckling halfway through his gravelly speech\n\nI raised an eyebrow at him \"Reed, have you been hanging out with Stella again?\n\nHe shrugged in response \"What can I say, she finally started recommending good stuff\" \n\nOlivia looked curious \"Stella? Another friend of yours?\" \n\nI shook my head and smiled, Watching fang pet Guts with a single finger was too cute. Olivia only just met everyone and she seemed to have hit it off with them. She was a reclusive girl and yet despite making a bunch of new friends and it looked like she was going to get another if she liked berserk enough to name her rat after it. One little push can change your life, I know that better than anyone. It only takes one friend to lead you to another, after all, you're not the only person in the world.","Title":"Wheel Of Fortune","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Olivia, Fang, Trish, Reed, Naomi and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Pshy"}},"Other":{"An Interesting Uncle.txt":{"path":["Other","An Interesting Uncle.txt"],"text":"Title: An Interesting Uncle\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Agent 47, Trish, Spears and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nJust laying on my bed listening to some music   \u201cBut you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me\nI'm the epitome of public enemy\u201d waiting for my shitpost about how the stream dic has no games  when I was interrupted by phone notification,  a text from a unknown number \n\nhey anon it\u2019s Tobias Rieper heard you need a suit for prom I can help you out with that, I\u2019l be there in 10 minutes \n\nit was ol mysterious uncle toby again, only ever say him at him occasionally at Christmas and easter but I did remember him cause he gave me 500$ every time, very useful for bowing it all on bionicles and bay blades. \n\ngot my jacket and shoes on and make my way down the stairs, and he pulled up right to the lobby door, his car was just like the one in the matrix long black and glossy, as I stepped in to it the I was overcome the smell of leather polish and vinyl, it was immaculate clean inside looked brand new,  we drove on in silence for a while, distracting myself by reading all the replies to my post only with the only sound being the quit hum of classical music coming from the radio, toby interrupted the silence by introjecting  \u201cso   anon how is your education going?\u201d  bit startled I replied \u201coh it\u2019s uh going uh good yeah yeah\u201d satisfied with the answer, we drove on 2 towns over, finally slowing down in the run down part of town\nfinally stopping in front of the store \u201cTommy\u2019s Tailors\u201d\n\nas we both walked through the door tommy welcomed us in saying \u201cwhat a pleasure it is too meet again 47 how may I help you today?\u201d\n\n47?

Every moment was dragged out by the surge of adrenaline, every second was used to its fullest, scrutinizng every miniscule twitch or movement, hoping to scry from it some portent of the future and in doing so secure their own.\nHis foe planted his right heel heavier in the ground than previously, he was certain of it, the dust rose higher and there was more of it. But was it a feint?.\nWordlessly his foe answered him, dark blue bearing towards him with a speed he could barely match, only deflecting the mighty blow due to his anticipation of it. Don Rodriguez reeled back as his opponent fell upon him again, escaping with only a graze on his left hip as he dodged the blow.\nHis foe turned towards him and began to strike him, time and time again, their swords singing, as they clashed, a passionate and violent song. \nBoth had wounded each other in the span of a few seconds, Don Rodriguez, cutting his foes tail after side stepping his opponents blow, this would soon be returned by a grazing cut accross his length of his chest.\nDon Rodriguez made a feint towards his right side, his foe raised his blade in response, before he struck his foe's short snout with his left fist, breaking his balance and sending him stumbling backwards. \nAt this opening Don Rodriguez lunged towards his enemy, thruing his blade forwards, sinking deep it into his upper left arm causing it to go limp and his opponent to furiously curse him in a tounge he barely understood as it did.\nSeeing his inhumanly strong opponent now relegated to using one arm, the emboldened conquistador charged towards him again grazing his right leg before dodging back to avoid a sweeping blow, not unlike that of a lumberjack felling a tree, convinced of his opponent desperation after such an attack that left him open, he readied himself for another strike.\nYet this bold and haughty plan was quicky brought low as his opponent, carrying his momentum, lashed his tail at his legs, its end striking like a whip tearing skin and cloth and offsetting the conquistadors balance, knowing that falling would mean death as his opponent would certainly seize upon the opportunity he made every effort to catch himself to the detriment of everything else, only noticing his foe bearing down upon him at the last moment, barely meeting his sword in time. \nThe blows that fell upon him, though lighter than before, were by no means gentle exhausting him as he struggled to make an opening to no avail, a brave attempt at siezing on an opening one of his foes blows had made led to him getting a deep gash across his upper body complementing the earlier graze.\nThe Spaniard seeing the futility of this assault retreated back yet as he did his opponent gave pursuit and cut into his right arm repaying the earlier wound that had been given him. His grip lossened, almost enough to drop his sword, he grasped it now with both hands, in case his right gave out.\nAgain his opponent rushed at him, his earlier speed now thankfully diminished though not so thankfully his strength was just as terrible as it had been, launched a fierce assault upon him resulting in a grazing wound to his left side and a deep gash on his right leg that, by some miracle had not torn into an artery.\nThe latter wound however had caused don Rodriguez to fall and anticipating his death was near his began to say a hail Mary as quickly and sincerely as he could and yet his opponent did not strike him down, instead after he finished his prayer his foe spoke to him.\n\n\"Let it go this war of yours, whoever your fighting for let them die, return to your home if you so dearly want peace\"\n\"No\" He spat coughing up blood as he struggled to rise to his feet \"I won't\" he struggled to stand upright grasping his sword as tightly as his hands would let him \"I can't\"\nStumbling towards his opponent sword in bloodied hand he coughed \"I couldn't return to that life\" again in between coughing up blood he bitterly said \"I wont live as a coward like I used to\"\nThe dark blue lizard moved in to kill the conquistador with mocking slowness and exagerated movements as if an actor in a morality play. An actor who played the role of pride presonified.\nDon Rodriguez lunged forwards, his wounds tearing and blood dancing around him like silk about a dancer from the orient, half a world away. The pain consuming every fibre of his being like a fire lit under him, it dragged every moment out to eternity and he felt weak.\nSo very weak.\nHis sword found its place in the side of the towering blue mass before him piercing his lung and stealing his breath both literally and by its sheer speed and the disregard the conquistador had for his own life.\nBefore the Spaniard could follow through his attack he fell to one knee, the pain of (what he had thought was) his last hurrah too great too bear, while his stunned opponent gasped for his breath \nHe could not die here, he had sworn to return for those unfortunate men of his who had not managed to escape from captivity when he and his company had, he had sworn to return for another also. \nYet if he did nothing he surely would die, but if he fought, not just against the hulking creature before him, but against the pain, against his own body, against the world, he might yet survive\n\nAgain he rose up and charged the lizard before him. As his foe saw the Spaniard, his movements wholly unbeffiting his injured state, his chest (and all his upper body for that matter) painted red, glistening in the dawnlight, so utterly covered in blood that he couldn't tell where he had wounded him. Indeed he had wondered wheater he had really injured him at all, if his sword had in actuallity done nothing to harm him, despite the ample blood to the contrary. \nHe recalled, despite the pressing matter of the undying Spanaird at hand, that the others had called these foreigners gods, then another more treacherous thought, so treacherous in fact that it had taken all his attention away from the current duel, had crept upon him as a cougar creaps upon its prey slowly readiying itself in a long drawn out moment before pouncing upon him\n\"Where they right?\"\nHis trance broke as his foe lunged towards him, deflecting the blade away from his neck only a moment before it struck.

It was in this particular world that the animator of evolution saw fit to preserve and in the fullness of time shape into fully rational creatures the primitive reptilian beasts that dominated the planet long before the emergence of their mammalian brethren. Side by side these two races had grown, fallen, suffered, been redeemed, and struggled for countless centuries, and it was this ceaseless companionship between evolutionary kin that had begotten her.\n\n\tNever had the girl been privileged to have the day of her birth recounted to her in any celebratory manner that was not an obvious mask for immeasurable sadness and regret. The luckier instances of its retelling were merely terse and dispassionate explanations, carefully framed as not to cause whoever had been selected as the unfortunate teller to fall prey to barely contained emotions that threatened at any moment to dissolve the natal narrative into an obituary.  Less fortunate recollections invariably spiraled into episodes of weeping and a suffocating aura of despair that would linger about for hours, days, weeks at a time.\n\n\tEventually, she had decided to stop asking about it.\n\n\tHer father had always assured her that her mother had held her, as a wailing long-snouted infant, in her rapidly weakening arms, and that she had looked upon her daughter with all the love in the world as she whispered her baby's name for the first time. For the only time.\n\n\t For the briefest instant, when their family was together and whole, when everything was okay, before the complications of childbirth tore everything apart and ensured that nothing would ever be okay again. \n\n\tWhile she had never known her mother, the girl knew almost as much about her as could be known. Photos, videos, memorabilia, and an enormous reserve of personal anecdotes from her loved ones had ensured that the exterior details of who Lucy Aaron had been were no mystery to her. The suburban house in the waterside city of Volcadera that her parents had purchased for a married life together that would unknowingly be cut short, and the houses of every relative or family friend that she had visited, were filled with framed pictures of her father's departed spouse -  more than enough to make it clear that the girl had grown into what was practically a spitting image of the silver-haired, feathered pterodon woman whose piercing amber eyes had been inherited wholesale by her only child.\n\n\tIn most of the photographs, the woman was smiling; an especially wide and goofily gleeful grin on her pronounced snout whenever she had been captured in the arms of her lover. A few others featured her giving the camera a playful scowl, usually in the context of some long-forgotten moment of levity that the girl had been told her parents would routinely engage in. Most of the pictures, if they happened to include anyone else, featured the girl's father, or else her mother's parents - the only set of grandparents that the girl had ever known, seeing as her father would for whatever reasons unknown to her never make reference to or take them to visit his own side of the family. Others included Uncle Naser, generally looking far more jovial and possessing an eclectic fashion sense almost totally unlike that of the conservatively dressed and solemn-faced pterodon man that the girl was familiar with. Still others were taken with the youthful past counterparts of Uncle Reed and Aunt Trish, even several with Uncle Moe.\n \n\tHer mother and father posing with each other on the night of their high school prom, dressed to the nines and half-blinded from the searing camera flashes of her overzealous grandmother. Her mother strumming away at a guitar, clearly so lost in the music that she did not even think to look up when the photo had been taken. Her father taken in a playful headlock by the feathery arms of his beloved, both captured in the midst of giggling mirth. Her hulking, intimidating grandfather with a wide and genuine smile, his eyes carrying a hint of wateriness as he stood next to his daughter in full wedding gown. Her petite grandmother barely able to wipe away the flowing tears as she hugged her baby girl on the day of the wedding. Her father in a tuxedo, his bride in his arms and both of them absolutely elated, unable to even take their eyes off one another long enough to focus them towards the camera. The happiest day of their lives.\n\n\tEvery single image was a gateway into an alien past that the girl was not and could never be truly privy to.\n\n\tThe videos were the only possible way available to her of hearing her mother's voice, of seeing the woman in motion. The veritable library of footage that her father had kept preserved a whole host of moments from her mother's life, a very nearly obsessive archive of both digital and physical material that would forever replay the limited fragments of time that were able to be kept and clung to. Her mother's soft and playful voice, the elegant and unique way in which she carried herself, the many idiosyncratic quirks of her person that could only be seen in action - these videos were the sole bridge that the girl had to all of these things.\n \n\tThere were grainy tapes of her mother as a young child, almost inseparable from her little brother Naser and parading about her grandparents' house under the guise of a \"pirate princess\", all the way to recordings made mere weeks before the girl's birth, her mother's dulcet tones cooing gently to the infant incubating within her and her father speaking eager promises to the girl yet to emerge from the womb, both of them still without the knowledge that their progeny would carry the woman to her grave. At this point she had seen quite nearly all of them, save for the entirety of a specific clip wherein her mother was playing a certain unique song on a piano during a particularly striking sunset, and which in two decades her father had been unable to bring himself to watch from beginning to end.\n \n\tIt was this archive that also presented the girl with another man, one who she could recognize as her father but who simultaneously appeared to her an entirely different person. This window to the distant past preserved, along with her departed mother, the man who her father had once been, the man who carried a different face than the worn and weathered one she knew, who lacked the perpetual and deep bags below glassy and pained eyes, and who was almost entirely without the greyed stubble that the girl was accustomed to. Absent wholesale from any of the footage was the quiet and thin tone that he had spoken with as far back as she could remember, replaced with a jocular and youthful voice that had almost stricken the girl as uncanny when she had first heard in the recordings the lighthearted remarks that were so jarringly unlike father who had raised her.\n\n\tThe girl's father was indeed a human, though if one were to describe him without mention of this fact or visual evidence, it would be a particularly difficult fact to ascertain. Her mother's traits had taken almost complete precedence over any simian ones that would have expressed themselves in their daughter's outside appearance, save for a small collection of nigh-imperceptible alterations to the usual upright bipedal form of a pterodactyl person that served little more than to give the girl's form a more vaguely anthropoidal bent.\n \n\tCertainly, it would be unlikely to extrapolate her father's status as a human from mere inquiry to any inhabitants of Volcadera, for even the most bigoted and intolerant of its more cantankerous reptilian inhabitants had nothing but esteem held for the man; there were no locals who were unaware of \"what had happened with Lucy\". She knew too well by now the hushed and reverent mood that would wash over any mention of Mr. Mous or his wife, the barely concealed pity that most people would try - and fail - to not allow color all of their dealings with the girl and her family. The knowing looks of sympathy and the tentative questions about how her father had been doing lately were simply a staple of everyday life for her, and always had been. \n\n\tThere was never a time that the girl could remember where her father had not gone out of his way to affirm that he loved her more than anything else in the world. Every single day, without exception, he made a point to say this to her, usually countless times. Still ingrained in both her heart and mind was his constant mantra, the words he recited with almost ritual significance and which he would repeat constantly to her: \"I'm so lucky to have you\". From her earliest memories of childhood, she could still hear him saying this, his most earnest - if unsuccessful - attempt at a smile not laden with sorrow, often accompanied with the most lavish gifts her young soul could imagine: the most elaborate dollhouse advertised on TV, the most expensive and prettiest dresses she could think to pick out, the most beautiful jewelry she could desire. Now as an adult, she had wondered in hindsight where he could have possibly gotten all of the money for the absurd amount of gifts that she had been spoiled with. She realized that he most likely did not ever have it.\n\n\tAlways, her father had a near-desperate desire to communicate to his daughter how precious she was to him, and most importantly how much she was wanted here, how glad everyone - especially him - was that she had been given to them, how she would always be welcome, always a blessing. As she grew older, she began to understand exactly why he had gone to such lengths to emphasize this. He could never bear the thought of her believing that what had happened was her fault.\n\n\tWhen he had first had to sit her down and explain to her, once she was old enough to understand, how her mother had died, it was the first and only time she had ever seen her father cry. Always, his eyes were glassy, usually bloodshot as well, but for her the sight of tears streaming down his pale and sallow face was entirely unique to that moment and that moment alone. Time had dried away all of the other tears he had left to shed, spent during the years she had been too young to remember, when he had wept a lifetime's worth of agony into the abandoned clothing that Lucy would never wear again and the lonely sheets where Lucy would never lay again. Time had left only these scant few drops to fall here, in this room that they had been sat in, this room that he shared with his wife for the few short years they were afforded together with its photos of their brief shared happiness and the empty crib that she would never sing lullabies to her child in and the empty photo frame with the imprinted text of \"I LOVE MOMMY\" that would never be filled with any photos of the mother and her child and the guitar that sat in the corner of the room collecting dust that she would never play again. \n\n\tA monument to his grief that he had built, and that he slept in every night.\n\n\tTime had left his two eyes as dry, hollow deserts that reflected a void that could never be filled. No matter how many false smiles or forced laughs he put forth, it was impossible to conceal the pain that emanated constantly from his eyes. Eyes that he had always looked upon his daughter with kindness and love, but also with a profound and immeasurable sadness, a deep abyss of grief which could never hide the fact that every time he looked upon her, and her amber replicas of her mother's own eyes, he was reminded of that which he had lost. Eventually, she came to understand this, and she also came to understand that it was this fact that her father resented himself for more than anything else.\n\n\tHer father loved her more than life itself, but she knew, and everyone knew, that something in his soul had been completely shattered, and could never be repaired. It was immediately apparent to anyone who looked upon him, in every photograph that had been taken from him since the day when the life of one of his two great loves was traded for the other. Nothing but the sincerest compassion was shown by him to all of his neighbors, but even this failed to mask what had happened to him. \n\n\tDespite their repeated affirmations that they did not blame him for what had happened to their daughter, that they loved him, that they would be there for him like family, that they were family, he could rarely look Mr. and Mrs. Aaron in the eyes. Rarer still would he ever be able to bring himself to make anything besides the most surface level small talk with them, undoubtedly in fear of tearing open once more the scars of the soul that had hardened into vast callouses.\n\n\tHis was a life of general austerity, subsisting something like a contemporary ascetic. He spent little on anything besides the most basic material accommodations for himself, though of course he would spare no expense for anything his daughter required. His diet was extraordinarily plain, fit only for the most essential sustenance, almost an intentional prohibition from any variety of exuberant flavor or delicacy. His usual attire was even plainer, and between his general unshavenness and lack of much grooming beyond the most basic necessities, one would perhaps be forgiven in mistaking him for a vagrant or addict who had wandered outside of Skin Row. \n\n\tWhen he wasn't at or working within the vicinity of the church, he was generally involved in volunteer work, and when there was no opportunity for work in that category he usually took up a variety of temp jobs. There was quite nearly no job that the girl's father was not willing to work, regardless of difficulty or pay. He seemed to be determined to contribute to the community of Volcadera in any way possible, and there were certainly few individuals in the city as well renowned for their conscientiousness among the locals as he. \n\n\tDespite his meager lifestyle and general lack of in-depth socialization, the man struggled to give back what he was able to those around him, to recognize that he was not the only person in the world. His daughter now quite clearly understood that this effort was equivalent to squeezing blood from a stone, and that he had always ultimately been trying to give more than what he had. It was this understanding that was the primary impetus of the decision she had now chosen. \n\n\tThe girl's slow but purposeful gait continued up to the doorway of the house which had now finally begun to lose its identity as a home and erode into an elaborate mausoleum. One of her feathered hands knocked gently at the old ornate wooden door, the other still clutching the acceptance letter. Soon enough came the light footsteps and the creak of the the floorboards, and she was met with wrinkled and prematurely aged face of her father as the door opened.\n\n\t\"Hello, darling,\" intoned the man's hoarse and empty voice.\n\n\t\"Hi, dad,\" she replied gently, \"May I come in?\"\n\n\tThey proceeded silently to the nearby coffee table, the girl failing to ignore despite her best efforts that her father's eyes still lingered on the photos of her mother that covered the house's interior. \n\n\tAfter their brief greetings, she explained to him in a concise but comprehensive manner that she had been accepted to her desired university, and that she was planning to enroll there. She would be moving out permanently, and leaving Volcadera. She had promised, of course, that she would still visit regularly and always keep in contact with everyone.\n\n\tShe very clearly took notice of the energy quickly dissipating from his posture and demeanor, as if the meager amount of vitality that had until this point been sustaining him was suddenly siphoned in one quick motion. The girl was not surprised by this turn of events, and she strongly suspected that her father had not been either. There would be no shock or emotional whiplash to this meeting.\n\n\tHe had, of course, attempted to dissuade her initially; it was his obligation as the parent to hold on, and she was grateful that he fulfilled that duty to the very end. Acceptance came quickly, however, for both of them, and he had hugged her with what little strength he had left for a long, long while, both remaining in silence, in that quiet and lonely house that had once the potential to be the home of a joyful and complete family, and would never actualize it.\n\n\tThere were no tears or breakdowns, no emotional pleas or heartfelt, drawn out final goodbyes, no last dramatic expressions of sorrow before the girl fully left the fractured nest; all that was already over. Her father's only quiet last statement to her was phrased as a tacit apology:\n\n\t\"I wish I could have done more for you.\"\n\n\tWordlessly, the girl took the cold, rough skin of the man's cheek gently in her feathered palm and planted a small kiss on his forehead with her lengthy snout. He nodded silently to her, and she smiled sadly to him, the first small sting of wetness in her eyes beginning to manifest in spite of herself. \n\n\tShe turned and walked out the doorway of that still and silent morituary to a happiness that never was, shutting the door gingerly behind her and slowly making her way back to where her car had been parked. The emotional weight of twenty-one long years began to trickle down from her brilliant amber eyes as she strode further and further away from the building, and took one final look behind her towards the front window where the living room couch and television set were visible. \n\n\tThe girl saw there still as stone and sitting at at the center of the couch, his battered and crooked form only a silhouette against the lighting cast by the evening sky, staring at the recently activated television, her father. The video played before him, the one he could never finish, the moment over two decades ago where Lucy had played that peculiar song on the piano, in the yellow-orange glow of the waterside sunset much like the one that currently shone. She knew he would not move from the spot for long hours. Perhaps days.\n\n\tShe turned back towards her car and attempted to quell the involuntary shaking of her limbs as bitter tears continued to flow, smearing her makeup against the edges of her snout and cheeks. She knew that this was not a moment of abandonment, that she would continue to keep touch, but she also knew that there was very little if anything left now to abandon.\n\n\tMost of her father had died when her mother had died. The tiny, fragile, ruined fragment that had been left was only a hollow shell, and it was that shell that dedicated all that was left of itself to her: his daughter, the daughter of his beloved Lucy, the child that they both had surrendered everything to beget. He could not save himself from his all-consuming grief, for there was nothing left to save, but he could devote what little remained of his meager being to her, to the only other love of his life, to the only living part of him that had been left by his wife's departure.\n\n\tNow, he simply had nothing left to give. Now, there was only grief and memory, a living and breathing grave, who remained only to replay long gone shadows of the past in an empty house. \n\n\tThe girl slowly opened the door of her car and entered, closing the door as she sat into the driver's seat. Her eyes gradually dried, and she briefly activated her phone, scrolling to one of the saved images of her mother that she had always kept there. This one was a simple photograph of her mother alone, wearing a plain yellow sundress with a decorative red bow in her lustrous silver hair, with an amber necklace that perfectly matched her shining eyes. The girl truly was a mirror image of her mother. \n\n\tShe opened another image, this one equally simple in its presentation but now featuring two subjects, her two parents, posing together for a photo taken on their honeymoon. Their smiles were simple, gentle, reassuring. Here was a moment of pure contentedness, a tranquil instant of pure and perfect love. Breathing deeply and slowly, the girl stared intently at the photograph, a short flurry of imagined memories dancing through her head of all the unsullied family moments that could have unfolded if things had gone differently, the long and happy lives that these two lovers could have had together under other circumstances, the unquantifiable amounts of lost and spoiled joy that would never be mended in this lifetime, and then closed her eyes, fighting back another round of tears that threatened to gush forth.\n\n\tWhen she had once more steadied her breathing, she reflected on what had in fact happened here, that her mother had loved her even in her dying breaths, that her father had dedicated every moment of his unliving life to ensure that she was loved and happy, that he had never for even the slightest instant failed to do so even as grief devoured him from the inside out over the years, that he had used what little he did not even have to raise her into the successful and fulfilled woman that she was today. She considered the love that was so unbreakable and so impossibly powerful that her father had been able to continue for two decades plus one year taking the best care possible of this girl, even when his own soul was torn asunder and ceased to animate his life with any true happiness. Her mother's love had given her father the strength he did not have, and for that the girl was immeasurably grateful. Lucy must have been proud of him.\n\n\tOut of the corner of her eye, the girl caught another miniscule glimpse of her father through the window of the house. He had not moved at all. The video he had begun to watch as she left was continuing on, evidently left to play on loop. She turned away and sighed, closing her eyes and taking a final deep breath, clutching at her golden cross necklace and offering a short prayer before opening her eyes to the sunsetting sky and switching on the ignition, and accelerating forward down the long suburban road, leaving the past receding behind her.","Title":"Goodbyes","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Amber and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Milhouse And Stacy - The Shitpost Of A Lifetime.txt":{"path":["Other","Milhouse And Stacy - The Shitpost Of A Lifetime.txt"],"text":"Title: Milhouse And Stacy - The Shitpost Of A Lifetime\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Milhouse and Stacy\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nMilhouse sat on the steps of the school, watching the sun set over the hills of Volcaldera, head in hands. Those assholes, the ones who always picked on him, had stolen his bus fare, and he had no other choice but to wait for his mom to pick him up, like some sort of loser. Sighing, Milhouse scrubbed his eyes with the back of his hands, a hand already wet with tears.\n\n\u201cWell, I AM a loser, I guess\u2026 Why does no one like me?!\u201d He mumbled to himself, wallowing in his despair.\n\n\u201cUhh, maybe it\u2019s because you, like, talk to yourself?\u201d \n\nA voice behind him made Milhouse jump. Scrambling to his feet, hands half-raised automatically in self-defense, Milhouse couldn\u2019t believe it: It was Stacy! Head the cheerleading squad, leader of the Spirit Club, and all-around school bimbo, Stacy was the last person Milhouse expected to stumble over him.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, Stacy?\u201d Milhouse\u2019s voice was tight, cold with resentment. Stacy represented everything he hated in school: The popular, the pretty, the successful. It irked him how Stacy always coasted through her classes, seemingly more interested in how she was dressed than what the teachers were saying. Somehow, she always managed to scrape together a passing grade. \u2018Probably by sleeping with the teacher\u2019, Milhouse added to himself.\n\n\u201cLike, what does it look like I\u2019m doing, geek?\u201d Stacy gestured to herself, to the cheerleading outfit she was wearing. Oh yeah, it was so late now, practice must\u2019ve gotten let out\u2026 Face reddening, Milhouse couldn\u2019t help but cast his gaze up and down Stacy\u2019s body, telling himself he was just looking at her uniform. Stacy was built like a brick shithouse, with a huge rack and massive ass that barely squeeze into her tiny cheerleading outfit. Her cleavage alone could consume his entire face, and there wasn\u2019t a guy in school who hadn\u2019t dreamed about being suffocated between those huge tits.\n\n\u201cI heard those guys, like, stole your money or something.\u201d Stacy\u2019s voice snapped Milhouse out of his thoughts. For once, the youth was glad of his baggy hand-me-downs he wore to school. \u201cThat was, like,  suuuuuuuper lame of them.\u201d\n\nMilhouse favored her with a guarded look, one eyebrow raised. Why was she being nice to him? Stacy never said anything to Milhouse, despite the fact they sat right next to each other in class, next to that weird albino goth girl. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you, Stacy? Looking for some poor sap to pay for your next shopping trip?\u201d Not caring about the acid in his voice, Milhouse resumed his staring off into the sunset, settling back down on the top step. \u201cJust leave me alone, okay?\u201d Glancing over his shoulder, Milhouse could see Stacy hadn\u2019t made any move to go, the big-titty airhead cocking her head to study him.\n\n\u201cUgh, you\u2019re such a loser! Listen, I, like, wanted to do something nice for you, so are you gonna\u2019 let me, or what?\u201d Stacy replied frostily, eyes narrowing. Milhouse felt his stomach drop at once, his eyes averting in shame.\n\n\u201cMan, I\u2019m sorry Stacy. Those guys just pissed me off.\u201d Milhouse could feel himself blushing: This was the longest he had talked to a girl who he wasn\u2019t related to, let alone the school fuckdoll. \u201cWhat was it that you wanted, Stacy?\u201d\n\nRolling her eyes, Stacy let her gym-bag drop to the stoop, pulling her hair back into a loose ponytail. \u201cSee, that\u2019s, like, everyone picks on you, Milhouse. You take everything so personal.\u201d From\u2026somewhere in her cleavage Stacy had pulled out a tube of lipstick, the pastel green contrasting nicely with the red stripe running down the middle of her face. \u201cYou just gotta\u2019, like, let loose.\u201d \n\n\u201cWait, wha-\u201c Milhouse turned back to her, totally bewildered by what she was saying. Before he could finish his thought, though, Stacy leaned over, her massive breasts, each easily larger than Milhouse\u2019s head, hanging pendulously beneath her chest. Unable to stare at anything else, Milhouse\u2019s gaze was fixed on Stacy\u2019s ponderous titflesh. Fuck, was that a beauty-mole peeking out of her shirt?!\n\nSlowly, Stacy raised Milhouse\u2019s face to her own, leading the entranced teenager by one long-nailed finger under his chin. \u201cMy eyes are, like, up here, big boy.\u201d Her bitchy bimbo voice was gone, replace by a sultry tone that tented Milhouse\u2019s pants even more. Slowly, Stacy lowered her lips the final interceding inches, planting a wet smack on his forehead, right below his frills. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go, like, shooting up the school, okay Milhouse?\u201d Stacy said, straightening up with a smile. Leaving the paralyzed Milhouse sitting there, a pastel green kiss mark just barely not blending in with his natural scale color, Stacy collected her gym-bag before heading down the stairs, her hips swaying seductively. Eyes draw to her like a moth to a flame, Milhouse could actually see her ass cheeks poking out from under her tiny cheerleading mini-skirt. At the bottom of the stairs Stacy paused, turning back to blow a kiss to Milhouse with a wink, giggling as she sauntered over to her parked car.\n\nRaising a trembling hand to his forehead, Milhouse felt where Stacy had kissed him, his scales still slightly damp from her kiss. \n\n\u201cThe guys at the AV Club are never gonna\u2019 believe this!","Title":"Milhouse And Stacy - The Shitpost Of A Lifetime","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Milhouse and Stacy","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Mother's Day Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Other","Mother's Day Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: Mother's Day\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Naser, Samantha, Ripley and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n>party at Fang's after VVorm Drama's concert at Moe's\n>may have pre-gamed the party a bit with Reed, vision still a bit fuzzy\n>see Fang dancing in the living room, rocking out to quality boomer rock\n>wait, did she get shorter?\n>and why does her hair look like she lost a fight with a can of hair spray?\n>realize a few seconds after I start talking to her that it's her mom\n>fuck they look so similar, shit's eerie\n>she's opted to break out her old 80s rock wardrobe from the days she used to go to concerts\n>she's gone all out on her hair, turning it from it's usual braid into some poufy, frizzy, hairspray infused abomination\n>but somehow, she makes it work\n>it's like a time traveling Fang\n>Samantha's clearly enjoying the party quite a bit too\n>she may or may not have hit the booze a little bit herself\n>gets into the classic rock songs blasting through the house's stereo system\n>know all the words, still mildly buzzed, I start to sing along\n>she takes notice and begins to sing along with me, a bit more enthusiastic\n>the two of us feed off of one another's energy\n>before long the two of us are dancing and singing in the middle of the living room without a care in the world\n>Stella and Rosa think it's adorable, Reed is cheering the two of us on, Trish is laughing her ass off\n>Naser looks like he wants to curl up into a ball and die\n>Naomi looks disgusted\n>the effervescent earache can go fuck herself\n>slow power ballad comes on\n>the petite ptero takes my hands in hers, presses herself right up against me to initiate a slow dance\n>both of us still singing along probably way louder than we should be but at this point we're having too much fun to care\n>get into the moment, twirling around with that little angel winged beauty\n>can't dance for shit, but the alcohol coursing through my veins says otherwise\n>everything is perfect right now\n>it only seems right\n>lean in, press my lips to my qt ptero goth gf's\n>wait\n>hold the fuck up\n>that isn't Fang, right\n>entire party is silent\n>Naser's jaw is dropped in horror\n>the real Fang's eyes are wide with disbelief\n>her face is contorted into a mixture of disgust and surprise\n>why the fuck did I just do that\n>Samantha is... shockingly okay with it\n>her eyes go wide with surprise for a moment\n>she then seems to disregard the bold act of intimacy almost entirely\n>pinches my cheek with a giggle\n>\"Ohoho!

She didn't rip my head off, at least, but she spared no expense when it came to informing me just how much of a fucking idiot I was. Thankfully, the entire incident was pretty obviously a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing, and not an actual affair. For the entire rest of the week, Fang had been relentlessly making jokes at my expense about how I was into \"older women\", and she had also told me that I was no longer allowed to drink unsupervised.\n\nAs for the rest of my little friend group, the incident blew over surprisingly easily. Nobody ever really said much of anything about it, aside from the odd joke here or there. I had gotten plenty of weird looks for the next two days or so after the incident, but nobody ever actually said anything. I don't think any of them wanted to be at all involved with that sort of weirdness any more than I did, and thank fuck for that. After that, everyone sort of moved on from the whole affair, though Naser was still speaking to me noticeably less than he usually did. Whether that was by his own choosing or at the whims of the ever present Naomi, nobody but them knew.\nThe real struggle had been living under the constant fear that Ripley would one day appear out of nowhere to snap my fucking neck at a moment's notice. Try as I might to push the entire incident aside, the pure rage I had seen in his eyes when he stared me down outside that house stayed fresh in my mind, as did his final warning to me.\n\"If I were you, I'd start watching my back.\"\nI had no idea how much control his wife really had over him, nor how far he was willing to go to take revenge for me accidentally kissing his wife, but judging by his general attitude that night, my guess was pretty fucking far. But, an entire week had now passed without incident. Every morning I had woken up expecting to find him towering over my bed, or to find limbs or organs missing. I wonder if he -\n\n\"HEY! Earth to Anon!\"\n\nI jump in my seat, the sharp voice in my ear shaking me abruptly back to reality. Fang shakes her head, glaring at me with a disappointed look.\n\"Geez Anon, you've been sitting there staring off into space for like ten minutes. I was starting to think you were dead or something.\"\nI give my head a little shake, trying to clear my mind. A quick glance up at the clock shows that lunchtime is already half over, and I've barely even touched any of my food yet.\n\"Yeah, sorry. Just got lost in thought, is all.\"\nShe smirks, leaning back in her seat a bit.\n\"Thinking about my mom again?\"\n\"You're never going to let me live that down, are you?\"\n\"Not on your fucking life, dweeb.\"\nShe brings her arms up behind her head, her smirk growing into a full blown cocky grin.\n\"Speaking of my mom... She actually wanted me to get you to come by my place at some point. Apparently she wants to talk to you about that little incident.\"\n\"Uhh, isn't your dad actively looking to murder me still?\"\n\"Probably. But even he knows better than to piss off my mom, and apparently she really wants you around for something. Who knows, maybe she just wants to kill you herself.\"\nI slump down in my chair slightly. Not exactly the most reassuring sentiment, but considering she was willing to save me once already, my chances of survival were probably a lot higher with her than they were with Ripley.\n\"Ah. Wonderful.\"\n\"Besides, you can easily just come over when he's out working or whatever. He works late nights all the time.\"\nWith a sigh, I lift up my sandwich that I've gotten for lunch, still in the wrapper. My appetite is practically nonexistent right now.\n\"I'm guessing I don't exactly have a lot of choice in the matter, do I?\"\n\"Well, think of it this way. You'll either be dealing with her, or with my dad. That's your choice.\"\n\"Greaaaaaaat.\"\nFang chuckles a bit, that shit-eating grin of hers only growing wider at my misfortune.\n\"I think he works late tonight, if you want to get it over with now. I can always make up some bullshit about a study session to Naser.\"\n\"Thanks, I guess.\"\n\"Hey, you're the one who got yourself into this mess. You should be grateful I'm helping your dumb ass at all.\"\n\"I know, I know. Kind of hard to be thankful when I'm being led towards my own grave, though.\"\nFang merely giggles in response, that toothy grin of hers wide as ever. I pick up my sandwich once more and begin to undo the wrapper. With a little luck, I'd be able to - \n\n*BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIINGGGGGG*\n\n... God dammit.\nI stuff my sandwich into my bag with a grumble as the oppressive bell blares though the auditorium. Guess I'd have to find an opportunity to actually eat later.\n\nThe rest of the day goes by without incident, and later on that evening I find myself in the backseat of the NasCar. Fuck, now he's got me calling it that too, god dammit. The ride is mostly silent all the way to Fang's house, with Fang reclining back in the passenger seat and Naser staying firmly focused on the road. He's still willing to interact and give me rides, at least, but the entire incident with his mom has seemed to put him kind of on edge around me. Can't say I blame the poor guy, honestly.\nEventually, we arrive at the large two story home, and the three of us proceed up the front walkway to the front door. Fang quickly turns her head towards me while Naser unlocks the door, giving me a quick, coy \"good luck\" before making her way inside along with Naser.\n\"Moooooom! We're home!\"\nFang calls out, making her way into the living room with her bag slung over one shoulder. Out of the kitchen, the little pterodactyl matriarch appears, a smile on her face as she greets her children.\n\"Welcome home, dear! How was your day?\"\nHer gaze is immediately drawn to me as she spots me, and she straightens up a little bit.\n\"Oh, I see you've brought Anon home with you as well!\"\nHer voice retains its usual motherly enthusiasm, she doesn't seem to be particularly upset, at least not at the moment anyway. Either that, or she's hiding it very well. I do my best to be polite, offering a sheepish greeting.\n\"H-hello, Mrs. Aran.\"\nShe gives a subtle nod, the smile on her face still present, but something seems different about it somehow. Like it's being held more out of politeness than as a natural show of emotion. She continues to look right at me, the little ptero keeping her hands clasped in front of her.\n\"Kids, why don't you go on upstairs. Anon and I need to have a little talk.\"\n\nWithout a word, Fang and Naser both depart, making their way up the staircase, Fang stopping only for a moment to look back at me over her shoulder with a hint of worry on her face, before turning away again and continuing up the stairs and out of sight. The little lady standing before me watches as they go up the stairs and out of sight... then continues to follow them, even after they've left the room and gone out of sight completely, her snout tracing their unseen path as she watches and listens carefully, the sounds of muffled footsteps on the upstairs carpet growing fainter and fainter. A few seconds later, there's the sound of a door closing, then another. Upon the second door shutting upstairs, the petite ptero looks forward again, her head dropping slightly as she lets out a deep sigh. She reaches up and rubs her fingers along the bridge of her snout, shaking her head slightly. \n\"Alright, Anon. Please, come with me.\"\n\nWith that, she turns to lead me through the house, leading the way through the kitchen and towards a door on the far side of it. She must have noticed how incredibly tense I was as she glanced back over her shoulder at me. She gives me a reassuring smile and speaks.\n\"It's okay Anon, you aren't in trouble or anything. I just want to talk.\"\nShe opens the door into the garage, stepping inside and moving aside to let me in past her, then closing the door behind her. As I step inside, I look over the garage quickly, mostly out of fear that Ripley will be waiting in the corner to jump me. Only one of the two vehicle bays are occupied at the moment, by a rather generic looking white car that must be her own, leaving the other spot for Ripley. One of the walls is lined with boxes and various knickknacks, the other is lined with tools. Against the back wall and in the corner, an unknown vehicle sits under a black cover, parked sideways, the bottoms of its wheels just barely visible. Thankfully, there's no sign of the murderous patriarch anywhere.\nSamantha takes a deep breath, letting out a long, slow exhale as she turns back towards me, slowly walking across the concrete floor. She stops next to the car, turning to face me and leaning back against the vehicle, looking me over as I stand in the remaining empty vehicle spot with her arms crossed over her chest.\n\"So I'm guessing that Lucy already told you why I wanted to speak to you, yes?\"\nI nod and dip my head a little bit, unable to maintain eye contact with her.\n\"Uhh, yeah. That thing that happened last week at the party, right?\"\nShe nods in affirmation.\n\"Yes, that's right. Look, Anon. I know that entire thing was probably a little bit awkward for you after the fact...\"\nYeah, no kidding. All of my friends thought I was some kind of freak and my girlfriend nearly tore my head off over it.\n\"... but, I want you to know that I don't hold it against you at all, Anon. In fact, I... Oh, god, how do I even put this.\"\nShe tilts her head back, looking up at a random spot on the ceiling as she tries to find the words to express a thought she can't quite explain. Not blaming me for it was easy enough for me to grasp, at least. We were both pretty clearly out of it. Was the entire incident eating at her as badly as it was at me?\n\"Anon... Right before that happened, when the two of us were dancing, and singing, and having fun without a care in the world who saw us or what people thought... I felt something.\"\n\nMy heart stops for a brief moment. Oh christ, was this ptero MILF about to confess to having feelings for me? My entire body locks up a bit, and I have no idea what to say or how to respond. All I can really do is stand there, and hear out the rest of what she has to say.\n\"I felt... I felt so young, I felt so alive! For that brief little moment, I didn't feel like I was the old woman that I've grown into, I felt like a young girl again, having the time of her life!\"\nMy heart rate drops, but only slightly. Okay, no confessions of romantic longing, not yet at least. Just a simple mid-life crisis. One that I apparently was responsible for starting. But what exactly did she want me to do about it? Why was she even telling me all of this?\nThe tiny woman continues, picking herself up off the side of the car and slowly walking over towards me, her gaze firmly locked to me.\n\"Anon, I'm... I know it's not really my place to ask you for anything like this, but... I'd like someone to spend a day with me this weekend. Someone younger, someone who can help me feel that way again.\"\nOkay, this has officially gone from kind of fucked up to super fucked up. Is she seriously asking me out on a date right now? No, there's no way, I have to be misinterpreting something. After staring at her flabbergasted for a few moments, I remember how to speak again.\n\"Uhh, Mrs. Aran... Aren't you married?\"\nThe little lady immediately brings her hands up, shaking them in front of her in dismissal, her eyes going wide.\n\"Oh! No no no no no, dear! This isn't a date or anything like that. I just want to...\"\nHer voice trails off, her head turning away from me as she stares off into the distance at nothing in particular. \n\"I want to feel young again. I want to be able to just let go of all my cares and worries, to just relax and have fun with myself. That day... that was the only time that I've felt like that since I was a girl, Anon.\"\n\nShe closes the remaining distance between us, reaching up and gently laying her hands on my shoulders, once more looking right at me.\n\"Anon... I don't want to force you into anything. If you say no, I will completely understand. But... I'd really like for you to spend a day with me, this weekend. Will you help me?\"\n\nI'm completely dumbfounded at the request. I look down at her face, the subtle wrinkles around the edges of her eyes betraying the beginnings of age. She looks at me with such desperation, such longing. It's evident that she wants, hell, NEEDS this far more badly that she's letting on. As messed up as this entire situation is... I find myself unable to say no.\nLooking into those eyes of hers, I see that they're colored amber. So very, very much like Fang's. For a brief moment, I see her, and not Samantha, standing before me. So desperate, so needy. I wonder, would I really deny Fang in her hour of need if it were her standing before me like this?\n\n\"...Yeah. Okay.\"\n\nThe pterodactyl immediately relaxes, her shoulders dropping slightly as she lets out a sigh, a soft smile of relief coming over her face. She drops her hands down off of my shoulders, clasping them together in front of her, lifting them up and holding them against her chest.\n\"Thank you. Thank you so much, Anon.\"\n\"So uhh... I'm flattered that you'd come to me, but... Why me, exactly? Why not just spend the day with your husband?\"\n\"Oh, Ripley... I'd love to take him with me on something like this, but honestly, he'd just think it was silly, would try to talk me down. All I want is a day that I can relax and not have to worry about anything. Including trying to get him to cooperate. Besides, he's working late this weekend, so even if he was cooperative, he wouldn't be able to go. As for you...\"\nShe turns, making her way back over towards the garage door.\n\"Well, frankly dear, you're the one who awakened this desire in me. This urge to feel young again. And I don't want to do all of this by myself, so it only makes sense to invite you along!\"\n\nWith that, Fang's mom opens the door to the main part of the house, holding it open for me and turning to face me with a smile. \n\"Now go on, go back upstairs and have your fun with Fang. I'll send you all the details later.\"\nWith a nod, I make my way through the doorway back into the house, with the petite ptero following closely along behind me. I try desperately not to let her see the nervousness in my face or the shaking in my legs. \nWhat the hell did I just agree to?\n\nThat Saturday, I find myself walking down the streets of Volcaldera Bluffs, on my way to whatever the hell it was that Samantha had in store for me. Definitely not a date though. Nope. Nuh-uh.\nI desperately keep telling myself that as I pull out my phone, checking the address she had texted me to meet her at. Thankfully, it was close enough to my place to walk to.\n[See you there! -S]\nI sigh and shake my head, trying to calm my nerves. Trying to justify the fact that I'm going on a da- err, spending the day with my girlfriend's mom. A quick glance at the time shows that it's still about ten minutes before noon, our agreed upon meeting time. The place is less than half a block away, so I've thankfully got a bit of time, no need to rush. I round the corner, and nothing could have prepared me for what I see next.\n\nMy eyes are drawn naturally to the bright, vivid red of the car first. A huge, boxy metal monster of a vehicle, it's sharp, pronounced corners and angles in stark contrast to all the other sleek, rounded, samey looking white black and silver cars everywhere else on the road. The next most prominent feature of the vehicle is its apparent lack of a roof, the windshield giving way to open air the whole rest of the way back to the trunk.\nThe fact that I think I see Fang for a split second is the next indication that I'm in the right place. Leaned up against the driver door of the vehicle is who I can only assume is the pterodactyl I'm here to see, but her appearance, much like at the party, is completely different from her usual image.\nHer long blonde hair has been released from its usual braid, allowed to flow freely down her back. A pair of sunglasses rests tilted up on her forehead, with large tinted lenses. Her usual green day dress is nowhere to be seen, replaced by a pair of faded denim jeans, a red cutoff tanktop that left just a tiny bit of her belly exposed, and a leather jacket worn over it. An outfit that likely hadn't seen the light of day since she was still a teenager herself. Her makeup is absolutely impeccable. The signs of age on her face that I had noticed the other day were completely absent, and she had somehow found that perfect balance between prettying herself up and looking like a dolled up nightmare. If I hadn't already had an idea who I was looking at, I never in my life would have imagined that this little lady was probably pushing her 50s. She looked a full 20 years younger, at least. Slowly I approach her, still looking her over carefully. Even now, I was still uncertain that it was really her, and not just some other ptero on an 80s binge.\n\"... Mrs. Aran?\"\nShe turns towards me, the smile slowly creeping across her face telling me that I'm right on the money.\n\"You've got it, tiger. But please. Just call me Sam, for today.\"\n\"Okay... Sam.\"\nShe picks herself up off the car, walking right up to me with her hands on her hips. She only comes up to my chest level, but the way she moves, the way she stares me down... she has an aura of command about her.\n\"Soooo. What do you think?\"\nShe gives a slight giggle, the expression of shock and disbelief on my face filling her with joy. There was no denying it, she looked... good.\n\"Uh, wow. That's something else.\"\n\"Hee hee~! I'm glad you approve!\"\nShe spins around, one of her wings unfurling and gently pressing on my back, guiding me towards the vehicle as she speaks again.\n\"So! Ready to party like it's 20M1987?\"\nMy body remains tense and locked up as it begins to dawn on me just how deep I had gotten myself into this mess. But I couldn't exactly back out now and leave this poor girl hanging. Especially when she looked so much like Fang. The prospect of breaking her little heart, even when my head told me so many times over how fucked up this entire situation was... I couldn't bring myself to do it.\n\"Yeah, I guess so. What exactly are we doing, anyway?\"\n\"Hop in, and you'll find out. I've got a couple places in mind.\"\n\nI make my way around the front of the vehicle, over to the passenger side as Samantha gets into the driver's seat. Gripping the metal handle, I pop open the door, and seat myself on the black leather. This stuff was probably genuine leather too, not that fake pleather shit so many cars used nowadays. The doors close once more, with the resounding, heavy thud of steel. Samantha pops the keys in the ignition, and starts up the engine. It whirs for a bit, then turns over with a deep, heavy rumble, the car vibrating a bit as it roars to life. Almost immediately, my ears are greeted by the sounds of classic rock blasting over the car's radio. With the grin on her face only growing wider with each passing moment, Samantha flicks her sunglasses down onto her face, putting the vehicle in gear and pulling away from the curb.\n\nFor a while, the driving is uneventful, and the two of us make small talk. Apparently, this car was the one I had seen in the garage sitting under that black cover - an old pet project of Ripleys that they could never quite bring themselves to get rid of. The very mention of his name sent shivers down my spine. Evidently, it showed, because Samantha took the time to repeatedly assure me that he would be kept in check. Her reassuring did little to actually reassure me, however. Eventually, the two of us make our way onto the highways leading out of Volcaldera, and it's there that Sam really lets loose. I feel the vehicle surge forward, see it pulling past the other cars as the wind blows over me from the open top. The speed limit is 65, but a quick glance at the speedometer shows that she's doing at least 90. Whatever it was that I had awakened within her, it had the normally sweet and motherly Samantha acting shockingly bold and adventurous. \n\nEventually, after maybe half an hour or so of driving, the freeway leads us to another city, where her driving falls mostly back into check. She drives to a large building, the neon sign out front giving the name of the establishment, but doing little to say what the place actually was. Whipping into the parking lot, the miniature Fang is eager to pull me from the car, leading me by the hand inside. Evidently this place is some kind of dance club. The room is dim, with most of the lights being colored or strobes, the beats of 80s dance tunes thumping throughout the building, the outfits of the other patrons and the music and general atmosphere suggesting at the place was having some sort of 80's night. Almost immediately, I'm reminded of the fact that I can't dance for shit. Even if I could, everything about this encounter just feels kind of... awkward. Sam drags me to one of the tables, plopping me down into one of the booths. \n\"Wait right here. I'll be riiiight back!\"\nWith that, she heads off in the direction of the bar, leaving me alone with my thoughts for a bit. As much as I wanted to help her, my mind couldn't help but shake the overall weirdness of this entire situation. Trying to convince myself that this wasn't actually a date was hard enough. But add to that the fact that it was a not-a-date with my girlfriend's mom... How was I supposed to ever get relaxed enough to help her like she expected me to? It had only happened at the party because I had been too drunk for my inhibitions to stop me. But right now, I was all too sober for this. Maybe I should have hit up Reed again before coming.\nEvidently, Samantha was all too aware of my concerns, and had the solution. She comes back with a drink in each hand, setting them down and sliding one across the table towards me. \n\"I know this whole thing probably feels a little weird. Just try to relax a little, won't you? Neither of us will get to have any fun if you're so tense all night.\"\nDamn, she had hit the nail right on the head. I glance down at the drink she's offered me, grabbing hold of the glass.\n... Did she really just give me alcohol?\nI turn back up to look at her, the pterodactyl already taking a sip from her own drink. Hopefully nothing too strong - she still had to drive, after all.\n\"Uhh... You do know I'm only 18, right?\"\n\"Yes, I know. Which is why you're only getting one. Don't think I didn't notice how hard you had hit the alcohol that night.\"\nShe pouts at me slightly for a moment, that motherly attitude briefly returning. Within a few seconds, though, her smile returns, and she seats herself in the booth across from me.\n\"Just try to relax a little bit.\"\n\nI glance down at the beverage, lifting it up off the table. Well, she wasn't wrong. It was going to be a long and miserable day if I was so tense the entire time. I needed to loosen up a bit if either of us were going to enjoy ourselves. I raise the glass up to my lips.\n\"Bottoms up, then.\"\nWith that, I raise the glass to my lips, tilting my head back slightly and sipping from the drink. It's some manner of mixed cocktail, though the taste of alcohol is still noticeable among the taste of coconut and cranberry filling my mouth. The action elicits a little giggle from her. The pair of us sit there, continuing to talk a bit about nothing in particular as we finish off our drinks. Slowly but surely, the uneasiness I'm feeling about this whole thing fades away, and I find myself getting more involved in the conversation with her, laughing and chatting along as she talks about the good old days. Apparently she had been a bit of a wild thing herself during her teenaged years - with more than a few habits from those days that she had decided should stay dead, even tonight. The more I learned about her, the more I saw Fang, sitting there before me. Though Fang had always been so insistent that she and her mother were nothing alike, it was shocking to me just how similar the two were... Far more alike than Fang would probably ever realize. \nAs I sit staring at my now empty glass, a small, taloned hand suddenly grabs me by the wrist, Sam standing up from her booth and pulling me to my feet.\n\"Cmon, let's dance!\"\n\"Now's probably a good time to mention that I can't dance. Like, at all.\"\nShe gives a quick little laugh as she continues to drag me in the direction of the dance floor, looking over her shoulder at me.\n\"Oh, trust me, I'm well aware of that. Your little display at the party kind of clued me in. Don't worry about it, just follow my lead.\"\nWith that, I'm dragged the rest of the way out onto the smooth, polished dance floor, Sam spinning right around on the balls of her feet to face me. As the high energy upbeat tunes and the sounds of electric guitars, keyboards, and synthesizers fills the air around me, the little pterodactyl begins to move her body, starting to shake and twist her hips, swaying them slowly back and forth while she bounces her knees a bit. She shouts out to me over the sound of the music.\n\"You don't have to do anything fancy, just move your body! Swing your hips, bend your knees, do what comes natural!\"\nWith that, she closes her eyes, letting the music take her. She brings her hands up level with her head, puffing out her chest slightly as she takes off, twirling around a bit as she sways and twists her body. She incorporates her wings into the display as well, unfurling them and opening them wide, slowly swaying and twisting them behind her. As she slowly rotates herself around, I can't help but glance down at her tail, and it too flicks about behind her, swaying to the beat of the music. \nI'm not exactly drunk by any means, or even really buzzed for that matter. But, whether by the alcohol or some other factor, I'm willing to give it a try for her. I begin to bob my knees a little bit, bringing my arms up in front of me. I'm completely lost. In my desperation, I resort to the only tactic I know - bringing my hands in front of me, I begin mimicking reload animations from various first person shooters in the air before me, pacing them to the beat of the song as I bob my knees. Sam's eyes drift open as she turns to face me again, watching me as she continues to sway her body and limbs. My \"dancing\" brings a grin to her face, the little ptero giggling as she takes a step closer to me.\n\"Wow, you really weren't kidding, were you? Here, let me.\"\nWith that, she reaches out, gently clasping my hands in hers, her fingers slipping between my own and interlocking with them. She brings herself nice and close to me, wiggling her chest and her hips. It's amazing how youthful she looks like this. Several more times, I find myself completely forgetting who it is I'm dancing with.\n\"Start with moving your body like me.\"\nI begin to follow along with her commands, moving my body as she takes the lead.\n\"Okay, now step!\"\nShe takes a step towards me, and I have to scramble for a few moments to keep my feet out of the way as she advances on me, my hands still interlocked with her own. In a few moments, however, I'm able to quickly fall into step with her, moving my feet to the beat of the music.\n\"And back!\"\nShe reverses direction, and I have to adjust myself again quickly, but I'm able to fall into step again much more quickly this time around.\n\"Now, give me a little twirl!\"\nShe releases one of my hands, bringing the other above her head as she spins herself in front of me, her soft wings oh so gently brushing against my face for a moment before she retakes my hand in her own.\n\"There we go! Now you're doing it!\"\nAs I move along with her, I find myself more and more willing to go along with it, and more easily able to keep up with her. The smile on her face grows wider as I start to pick it up, our little improvised dance session growing more refined as it carries on. One song fades into another, and we seem to lose ourselves to time as our dance session goes on, both of us letting the music take us away and moving with one another as we did on the night of the party. Singing along with the songs we know, merely dancing for the ones we don't, minutes all too quickly turn into hours.\n\nAs the day turns into the evening, we end up leaving the dance club to go get some dinner. Samantha takes us to an older styled restaurant, one of those places with red leather seats and chrome absolutely everywhere. Once again we end up seated in a booth, chit chatting with one another over our food about her past, only this time, it's much more lively. As the night has carried on, my inhibitions have seemed to vanish. Time and again I find myself compeltely forgetting who it is I'm with, and merely enjoying her company for the sake of it. I almost call her Fang on several different occasions, and have to catch myself. I look at her, and I don't see a mother, or that sweet, petite older woman that I've met a couple times at Fang's house. I see something else. A spry, energetic young thing, practically indistinguishable from my girlfriend. Sometimes for minutes at a time, I think that she IS my girlfriend and simply roll with it. One thing, however, is certain - I'm having a wonderful time with her now that I've allowed myself to relax a little bit. All my concerns about how I would feel, what people would think, all of them have gone out the window. \n\"Hey Anon, pop a quarter in the jukebox for me, would you?\"\n\"Uhh, what?\"\n\"Put something on for me!\"\nShe slides a quarter across the table, practically shoving it into my hands. I turn over towards the jukebox sitting in the corner of the room against the wall. I stare at the machine for a bit, before turning back to her. Her head tilts a bit, her eyebrow raising slightly. My confusion must be pretty evident.\n\"Oh come on. You've NEVER used a jukebox before?\"\n\"Well, no, not really. Never really been in a place like this before.\"\nSamantha rolls her eyes, tilting her head back and shaking it slightly, before grabbing my wrist once more, a tinge of playful annoyance in her voice.\n\"Come on.\"\nFor the second time that night, she leads the way, leading me by the hand over to the jukebox and popping the quarter into the slot, showing me how to operate the controls as the lights on the machine turn on. The machine faintly whirrs as she has me flip through the selections, the pages of the little mechanical song menu behind the glass flipping with each press of the buttons. Half the songs on the machine are ones I've never heard of, although there are a small handful more popular tunes that I've heard before. Eventually, the two of us decide upon a song, and I awkwardly push the buttons to make the selection. The arm inside the machine comes to life, rising and rotating to grab a large vinyl record from where it's stored, lowering it into place and beginning to spin as the needle positions itself. A few seconds later, the music starts up, the machine playing in a much higher quality than I would have expected from an old record like that. I can see the desire to dance burning strong in Sam again as we make our way back to our seats, the subtle sway and slight bounce of her hips, the way that tail flicks about and dances behind her. Eventually, the two of us finish up our food, but the night is still young. And evidently, Sam still has more in mind for the evening. Instinctively, I try to pay the bill for her when it comes around, but she slaps my hand as I go to reach for it with a playful smirk before snatching it up herself. I ask her, still rubbing the back of my now stinging hand. Even messing around, she still hits surprisingly hard.\n\"So, where to next, Sam?\"\n\"Well, I was thinking maybe for the rest of the evening we could hit up a drive-in and catch ourselves a movie.\"\n\"A drive-in? Do those places even still exist?\"\nShe nods, folding up a handful of bills and stuffing them into the small leather envelope with the check, setting it down on the table and stuffing another small handful of bills underneath her drinking glass to tip the waiter.\n\"Just barely. There's a small handful that still operate. Nowhere near as popular as they used to be, but I know a place!\"\n\nWith the bill all paid and our bellies full, the two of us once again drive off into the evening, the sun by now setting over the horizon. I watch her as she drives along, sunglasses shielding those amber eyes of hers from view, a smug grin on her face as she handles the steering wheel with one hand, the other arm resting over the door. Her hair billows behind her as the wind flows through it, her hair shimmering like gold to Fang's silver as the light catches it. The pair of us arrive a while later at the drive-in theater, with Sam paying for a pair of tickets and pulling into a spot. She leans out of the car and grabs what she tells me is a speaker off of its stand, affixing it to the driver side door. By now the sun has completely set, and it's dark enough to see the projector lighting up the large screen. For the time being, it's nothing special. Just previews and advertisements.\n\"Hey, Anon...\"\nMy attention is drawn from the screen by the sound of her voice. She's leaned over the center console, looking at me with a soft, subdued smile on her face. Her sunglasses are flipped up onto her forehead once more, letting me look right into those deep amber eyes of hers.\n\"Would you like to... sit in the back with me?\"\nOh fuck. \nIs she seriously asking me for what I think she's asking me for?\nOne of her eyebrows raises as I stare in silence at her, her smile turning to a frown for just a moment. \n\"Anon, I mean just to sit with me. I'm married.\"\n\"Uhh... Sure, why not.\"\nShe rolls her eyes, giving a soft snort as she stands up in her seat, swinging her legs over the center console and stepping into the back of the vehicle. She helps me to my feet and over the seat as well, and the entire process is made significantly easier by the lack of a roof on the vehicle. The two of us seat ourselves once more, both of us sharing the bench seat. Sam snuggles herself right up against me, nestling right into my arm, wrapping one of her arms around mine and laying the other across my chest. Ordinarily I'd be a bit more freaked out by the display of affection, but... something is different now. Somehow, I don't at all feel repulsed or weirded out by tonight anymore at all. In fact, I've actually quite enjoyed myself,\nand my time with Sam. She drags one of her fingers over my chest as the previews come to a close, drawing her snout nice and close to my head, sneering at me.\n\"Trust me, Anon. If I were twenty years younger and wasn't married, I wouldn't be asking nicely.\"\nInstantly, my blood turns to ice. The tiny pterosaur bursts into a fit of laughter upon seeing my shocked expression, tightly clinging to my arm as I try desperately not to think too hard about the implications of what she's just said. She lightly slaps my chest, grinning from ear to ear.\n\"Oh, relax a little, Anon! I'm only playing with you. A girl has to have fun sometimes too, you know!\"\nThe movie eventually gets started, some old 80's action flick, with Sam laying herself against me the whole while. However, my attention is only half on the movie. The other half remains on her. The more time I spend with her, the more this little lady utterly mesmerises me. The more I see her as a wonderful, beautiful woman. The more I see my girlfriend within her. Her petite little body lays snuggled against my chest, her head resting on my shoulder. At one point, my own hand moves purely by instinct, wrapping itself around her side to hold her close, oh so gently rubbing her, with the steady, rhythmic thump of her tail against the seat proof of how much she's enjoying herself. One of her wings unfolds as I hold her close to me, wrapping itself around my back and pulling me right back against her, the touch of that soft, downy wing firm, yet gentle at the same time. Like pressing myself against a soft, feathery pillow. I stare down at her, watching as the light of explosions and gunshots on the screen light up her eyes, and in the ever dimming light around us, all signs of her age have completely vanished. The color of her hair indistinguishable in the darkness behind her. With none of the subtle differences tipping me off, only my memory of who I'm with is able to tell me that this is anyone other than Fang. For the next hour and a half or so, we simply lay in one another's arms, with me occasionally glancing down at her, and her looking right back up at me. That smile on her face tells me all I need to know - She's had a wonderful night.\n\nEventually, as the movie draws to a close, she sits upright with a soft sigh, gently pulling out of my grasp and unwrapping her wing from around me, pulling it back in against her back, and allowing the cool night air to wash over my back and sides once more. It's a pleasant temperature, with the gentlest breeze present to caress our bodies. Unfortunately, the night was drawing to a close, and it was a decent drive back to Volcaldera Bluffs. She turns over towards me, a slight longing in her eyes. Without words, I know exactly what she's thinking. I know, because I'm feeling the exact same way.\nNeither of us want this night to end.\nUnfortunately, we're both equally aware that time is merciless, and flows ever onward. As all bad times eventually pass and fade away, so too must the good times eventually come to an end. She forces a soft smile onto her face, reclining in the seat a little bit, her hands neatly folded in her lap. \n\"Well, Anon... It is getting kind of late. But, I was thinking... We have just enough time for one last stop. You wanna grab some ice cream before we head back?\"\nI nod, my earlier reservations about spending more time with her completely absent by this point, smiling right back at her.\n\"I'd love to, Sam.\"\nHer smile grows, a bit more genuine now.\n\"Let's do it.\"\nShe grabs the back of the driver's seat, pulling herself up and stepping back over into the front of the vehicle, with me following suit in the passenger's seat. She places the speaker back onto its holser, and once more the engine of the red beast that we ride in rumbles to life as she backs out of the parking space, slowly making our way through the sea of cars and following the trail of tail lights out of the drive in, towards our final destination of the evening. \n\nThe road eventually takes us to a small shop on the road alongside the sea, absolutely jam packed with people on such a lovely evening. However, the massive line does nothing to deter either of us, and we both stand happily side by side in the line, talking and conversing with one another, with Sam as eager as ever to reminisce about days gone by. I'm not sure when, but at some point we've started holding hands. However, I make no attempt to separate. Whereas at the start of the day, everything about this felt so wrong, so unnatural, it now felt as natural as ever. Though there must have been at least a dozen or more people in line ahead of us, we make it to the counter in what feels like no time at all, and place our orders. Sam opts for a chocolate cone with chocolate dip, with myself getting a caramel swirl. Ice creams in hand, the two of us decide to walk along the sidewalk together, staring out over the dark sea and the starry, moonlit sky above. Even after our ice creams are both gone, we find ourselves losing ourselves to time once more, wanting nothing more than to enjoy one another's company.\nEventually, Fang... or, Sam, rather... turns to face me, my hand firmly held in both of hers.\n\"Anon... I have to thank you. For everything that you've done tonight. Spending your weekend with an old woman like me... It's made me feel absolutely wonderful. It's made me feel young again.\"\nShe pulls herself close to me, holding my hand against her chest, closing her eyes for a moment as she dips her head down. \n\"But... At the same time, I can't just go chasing the past like this, Anon. As much as I'd love to sit here and pretend I'm a young woman again, cling to these memories of the past, of my youth... I just can't. I have new obligations, Anon. Both as a mother, and as a wife.\"\nI stand in silence, gently placing a hand on Sam's side to hold her while she voices her thoughts, her inner turmoil, everything that has been brought up within her ever since that night at the party.\n\"I've loved everything about tonight. But if I were to go chasing these feelings forever... I'd be robbing my daughter of the chance to make these kinds of memories herself. She deserves to enjoy her younger years every bit as much as I did.\"\nShe picks up her head once more, her eyes flickering open once more. Once more I find myself staring into those brilliant amber gems, losing myself in her gaze as she brings her hands up to my shoulders, pulling herself right up against me, her snout pointed right at my face. Her voice is soft, soothing, as she speaks.\n\"You're a wonderful young man, Anon. She deserves a man like you in her life.\"\nShe moves her face in ever so slightly closer. The moonlight catches in her eyes, lighting them like fire. And in that moonlight, I can see it. The tired eyes of that middle aged woman I spoke to in the garage are gone. Replaced, by something else. These eyes burn with life, with vigor, the flame reignited within her. And in that moment, she and Fang are one in the same. A single, indistinguishable entity. I've given her exactly what she needs.\n\"I want to thank you, Anon. Personally. From the bottom of my heart.\"\nShe shifts even closer, her head tilting ever so slightly. I know exactly what's coming. And yet... I don't combat it, at all. As our mouths draw ever closer, she stops just short, bringing a hand up and gently pressing a finger to my nose, an ever so slight smile coming to her face.\n\n\"You get one, and only one. Make it count.\"\n\nWith that, her hand drops back to my shoulder, her fingers interlocking behind my neck, my arms around her waist. We close that final bit of distance between us, and for the second time, Sam and I kiss. Only this time, there is nothing accidental about it. Her lips quiver against mine for a few moments, the little ptero giving a soft, muffled moan as she hangs lightly off of my neck, my mouth locked against hers. She takes the initiative, tilting her head to one side to lock her maw even more tightly against my own. Apparently, this little lady knows firsthand how to make human on pterodactyl smooching work flawlessly. Yet another subtle hint of the experience she has under her belt. Her jaw shifts ever so slightly, reaffirming its lock against my mouth as I return the favor, kissing her nice and deep. Allowing her to savor the warmth of my lips against hers. I can feel a shiver run through her entire body, and the rush of air from her nose over my face as she exhales, relaxing herself against my body. All the while I gently hold her, keeping her pressed snugly against me, my hands slowly drifting up and down her spine, gently slipping under her jacket to caress the bare scales of her lower back. Making her feel young one last time. \nBut as all good things must come to an end, so too must our embrace. Slowly, we pull apart, our lips gently sliding over one another and separating, mouth still hanging slightly open in the faint hope that perhaps the two pairs of lips will meet one another again. But it simply isn't meant to be. At the end of our day together, Sam has accepted this. Slowly, she pulls her head back, a soft huff escaping her mouth as she breathes, her grip momentarily tightening around the back of my neck as she smiles up at me.\n\"Thank you, Anon. For everything.\"\n\nHand in hand, the two of us make the walk back to the car, hopping in, preparing for the drive back home, back to our regular lives. Despite all the reservations that I had before, I find myself oddly at peace. Glad that I had decided to give Sam a chance, to spend a day with her. Glad that I was able to help her come to terms with her life. Help her feel young again, help her find herself again. Not an ounce of regret was within me, except a single small part of me that longed for this evening to continue, a wish that I knew could never be satisfied. As the engine of the car roars to life, Sam reaches over to the center console, popping it open and fishing out a small case. Opening it, she pulls out a small cassette tape, popping it into the player. As the puts the car into gear, the tunes begin to play, the unmistakable sounds of Hall and Oates blasting over the car speakers as we drive off into the night, the cool night air blowing over the two of us as we make the drive back to Volcaldera Bluffs.\n\nYou're out of touch~\u266a\nI'm out of time~\u266a\nBut I'm out of my head when you're not around~\u266a"},"Reunion.txt":{"path":["Other","Reunion.txt"],"text":"Title: Reunion\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Amber and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n    Now it was the present moment. It had always been.\n\n\tThey walked without clear destination across the quiet beach, the husband, the wife, and their child. Footsteps only audible by their faint impact against fine pale sand accompanied the family's silhouettes, defined against the setting sun's illumination which blanketed the entire visible coast in its signature orange gold. The summer breeze, warm and thin, joined the minute percussion of the family's steps in concert with the rhythmic tidal whispers which hovered over the face of the waters. \n\n\tThe husband, human, and the wife, winged reptile, stood together and in near lock step as if they had been one flesh. In her arms the pterosaurine woman held their daughter - no more than seven years old - and both of the excitable girl's parents engaged in continuous playful conversation as they continued leisurely across the serene shore. The child had received the vast majority of her traits from her mother, who even now she unmistakably reflected in appearance, tiny feathered wings flapping excitedly against the woman's hold as her citrine eyes gazed into perfect replicas. \n\n\tThe mother's wider and matured wings trailed gracefully behind her as she walked in contrast to that of her offspring's, and her silvery hair which she had also passed on to her daughter fell gracefully at her sides, shining in the familiar sunset's rays. She wore a plain yellow sundress with a decorative red bow, a golden pendant worn as a necklace around her neck, that same shade which had colored their lives, and a similar miniature counterpart of the outfit was worn by her daughter in a shade of vibrant pink. Matching her height beside her was the woman's husband, dressed in plain khakis and a dark green dress shirt, his face now aged ever so slightly compared to the day of their child's birth but still absolutely unchanged in the expression of pure love with which he never failed to look upon the two loves of his life.\n\n\tOnly a scant few passerby now graced the beach or its surrounding area, hums of passing vehicles a rare and distant occurrence which did little to disturb the tranquility of this seaside vista. Gradually, the family's strolling gait slowed and they giggled collectively over some frivolous revelry that had happily beguiled them. There was a prolonged pause as the mirth settled down, and then the girl had inquired about something to her mother, who in turn looked towards her husband in contemplation before returning her attention to the child and nodding in assent to what had been requested. She brought her long snout towards the child's equally beaked face and pecked at the young girl's cheek, and then she descended along with her daughter in her arms to the earth below, letting her hold on the child go once tiny feet touched the ground. \n\n\tImage of the parent, the daughter proceeded from her mother and onto the waiting sands, therein unfolding a receptive feminine reflection of the world around and within them. The girl took in for a still moment the sights of the littoral expanse, and then she kicked off her shoes and stepped forward, slow and tentative at first but then rapidly transitioning into first a brisk jog and then a practical sprint, no barrier now present to whatever she may tread upon. She ran across the shore, glittering waves behind her continuously coming to rest with the land at the coast in the ancient dance that the Lord had set there in innumerable eons past. And she was dancing, too. Hopping about aimlessly at first, and then twirling around, once, then twice, peels of innocent laughter escaping her beak and her small wings unfurled, the motions kicking up fine grains of crystalline sand which clouded briefly around her form like points of sparkling light in a fine mist. \n\n\tA few gulls gathered on nearby rocks, perched and silently watching one of their long distant evolutionary cousins pirouette along the coastal stage. She trusted the earth beneath her feet and the heavens above her head without reservation, and they happily responded in kind. The magnificent solar rays, from the same sunset which had seven years ago christened her with the name of their gleaming brilliance - Amber - painted the sky in their trademark luminous golden orange, generously imparting their warm tones upon all they touched. Across from the shining tangerine descent of the sun, the moon had already arrived above the horizon, ahead of the night, eager to join in the stellar waltz. \n\n\tAnd along the golden beach, and on through the quiet nearby roads, and further still into the heart of the city of Volcadera, like a relaxed and harmonious exhalation, all became tranquil. Far from where Amber danced, shops littered along the district of Little Troodon slowed in their activity, with only a few last tentative customers idly perusing about, most still present having found a place to settle and take in the sights of the vibrant evening, tiny snippets of their conversations serving as windows into hundreds of lives equally as dazzling as the sunset above them. The interior of Dino-Moe's, illuminated as it had always been by empyreal light from its large front windows, bustled with patrons anticipating its renowned dinners - as it always had. Beyond and deeper yet into the town, past serene suburban roads and onto the school district, stood Volcano High, emptied for the summer, standing as a hibernating monument in brief repose against the beaming citrine welkin before the time would come again for it to open its halls to a new flurry of young memories, experiences, and dreams. \n\n\tAnd there surrounded the building still the verdant gardens that had remained carefully tended to by successors of their original attendant, as colorful and as lush as they had been years ago, a couple of bumblebees studiously perpetuating the process of pollination, their fuzzy bodies rustling small portions of the flowerbeds as they hovered to and fro. Above, and overlooking the vacant parking lot, wind passed across the surface of the school's roof, rattling gently the chain link fence which surrounded it and the metal ladder affixed to the end of an elevated section that rose higher still. The roof's concrete floor had long been dry of the tears that had long ago fallen from a quivering snout, long quiet of the soft notes from an old guitar fashioned into a makeshift hall pass that had sounded off through the air during countless songwriting trysts. Distant sounds of vehicles traversing the surrounding city's roads grew less frequent, a soothing peace settling in the warm summer air and embracing the vast expanse of urban settlement. Here was a city at rest, evening breeze passing through the streets as air released from great paved lungs, bathed in amberlight radiance.\n\n\tOn the beach, the child's parents stood shoulder to shoulder, the mother's wings unconsciously moving to bring one of their feathery spans across the shoulder of her lover. He leaned in towards his wife - his Lucy - and whispered something to her softly, which caused her snouted mouth to curl into a warm smile and her glistening orange eyes to grow watery as a single tear fell down her cheek, touched by the words he had said to her that only the two of them were privy to. And she brought the lips on the end of her long muzzle to his - a practice they had both become extraordinarily familiar with - and delivered a chaste kiss, before they both turned towards their daughter who twirled in tandem with the rhythm of the crashing waves, looking upon her with a singular and unified love which surrounded and guarded her like an all-pervading sentinel.\n\n\tWithout a sound, Amber felt her parents wordlessly calling to her across the sands and the waves, and she pivoted towards them, sprinting with her arms flung out to her sides and wings fully extended, flapping joyfully against the wind. She was carried a few inches into the air briefly by the feathery motions, flying in the golden sky's light, before her feet touched down again to the ground, drawing closer to the waiting arms of her mother. Then she leapt forward and returned into those outstretched arms of infinite, luminous compassion from which she had come, and it was if she had never left.\n\n\n\n\t\"On the vast canvas of the Self\n\tthe picture of the manifold worlds\n\tis painted by the Self itself\n\tand that Supreme Self\n\tseeing but itself\n\tenjoys great delight.\"\n\t\t-Adi Shankaracharya, Svatma Nirupanam","Title":"Reunion","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Amber and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"The Queen.txt":{"path":["Other","The Queen.txt"],"text":"Title: The Queen\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Amber, Samantha and Ripley\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n~The Queen~\n\nThey never think to check behind the recliner. Like a shadow in the night, I am invisible here. My Halloween costume still fits snugly, and my ninja daggers are at the ready on my belt. Mom and Dad tried to hide the costume from me, but since they're gone for the weekend, they can't protect it anymore. I had to climb up to the highest shelf in their closet when Grandma and Grandpa weren't looking. The enchanted outfit fills me with mystical power, and once again, I have reached my full potential. From the dining room, I hear the sliding glass door open and mumbled voices debating something. My targets are nearby, but I must wait for the perfect moment to strike. I pull out a throwing star from my pocket, readying myself to spring like a panther.\n\nThe voices get louder and louder as my targets enter the living room, placing themselves in my sights. Wait for it...\n\n\"Sweetheart, you know how she is. She wouldn't just run away, I don't think-\"\n\n\"I'm not risking it, Samantha. We're calling the station.\"\n\nGrandpa steps towards the end table and picks up the home phone. This is my moment. As he begins to dial, I silently exit my hiding place. He's very tall, but the bigger they are, the harder they fall. As I leap onto the sofa, Grandpa turns, and the last thing he sees is a throwing star zipping straight toward his head. My perfect throw hits; the star bonks him on the forehead before falling to the floor. As he recoils in shock, I jump off of the sofa and unfurl my wings, dramatically slowing my descent to the ground and landing in the middle of the living room. I draw both of my daggers as Grandma turns to me, preparing my fighting stance and beginning my grand speech.\n\n\"Under the new moon, my blades will strike true!. With the power of the night, I will be your last sight!\"\n\nBoth stare at me, motionless; I can sense their pure fear as I finish my speech.\n\n\"I am Amber Mous, the Shadow Queen of Volcadera! Prepare to take your final breath!\"\n\nI look at both of my targets. Grandma begins to look relieved, but Grandpa starts to look really mad. He looks like he's about to yell, and I can't help but be scared until Grandma suddenly grabs his arm really tight.\n\n\"Ripley, dear.\" She says, putting her other hand on his shoulder. Grandpa stops, and it looks like he's not as mad.\n\nStill, while pointing at me, he says, \"Amber, you.. *Don't* do stuff like that! Do you know how long we were looking for you?\"\n\nI don't know how long I was hiding, but I think it was awhile. I can't help but start to feel bad. I didn't mean to make everybody sad. Pouting, I look down towards the ground.\n\n\"I.. I was just trying to have fun.\" I say, trying to apologize.\n\nGrandma takes a step toward me, crouching down on one knee as she whispers, \"I know, honey. We were just worried about you.\"\n\nShe places a hand on my shoulder, and I look up at her. She's smiling at me, and I don't feel bad anymore. Grandma always knows how to make me feel better; I drop my plastic daggers and give her a big hug as thanks. She's happy to hug me too, and I even notice that Grandpa isn't mad anymore. He starts to look sad, and I'd give him a hug too, but he starts to walk towards his recliner, the one I was hiding behind. He grabs a magazine from the little end table next to the chair and basically shoves his face into it when he sits down. I let go of Grandma, and she looks at him, too. I expect her to say something to him, but she just looks back to me.\n\n\"Amber, honey, you should go change out of that costume.\" She says, trying to coax me into following Mom and Dad's rules.\n\nI don't even try to mask my disappointment as I whine, \"But Graaaandmaaa, I really like it. Just for today? Pleeease?\"\n\nShe thinks for a bit before telling me, \"You don't want to get it dirty when we eat lunch, do you?\"\n\nMy heart skips a beat as I realize what she just said. With barely contained excitement, I stutter, \"W-What's for lunch, Grandma?\"\n\nShe looks at me with a knowing smile, saying, \"If you change, I can put some dinosaur n-\"\n\nThat's all I need to hear. Before she even finishes, I pick up the plastic daggers from the ground and turn tail, running back to my room in a frenzy. I push the door closed behind me, trying to take the costume off with surprising difficulty. I finally do, and since Grandma never said anything about *what* to change into, I put on my pajamas; the really comfy ones I got for my birthday. I open my door back up, running back through the house. I find Grandma in the dining room, taking out a baking pan and some tin foil from the cabinets. As she turns to me, I unfurl my wings and strike a pose.\n\n\"Tada!\"\n\nShe stares at me for a little bit. I start to wonder what's wrong, but then she just starts giggling.\n\n\"Mph! Hmphgh! Oh, honey, you're adorable!\" She says, a smile shining brightly across her face. She comes up to me again and scoops me into a surprise hug; I didn't expect it, but I hug her right back. Grandma really is the best.\n\n\n~\n\n\nMe, Grandma and Grandpa are all sitting at the dining room table now. I look down at my plate; Grandma gave me a whopping ten dino-nuggets with ketchup, and she said there's still more! Grandma made herself a tuna sandwich, and made Grandpa a ham sandwich. They're both eating quietly, not saying anything to each other. I might have noticed, if I wasn't busy chowing down on my favorite meal. I think to the near future; maybe we can watch a movie on the big Tee-Vee! Before I get a chance to say anything to Grandma, Grandpa stands up from his chair. It looks like he's done eating.\n\n\"I'll- be outside.\" He says. Grandma looks up at him, and looks kind of disappointed.\n\nShe looks toward him and says, \"Ripley, you told me you'd stop.\" Grandpa is silent for a moment, before sighing.\n\n\"I'm trying.\" He says, before leaving the dining room entirely and walking for the front door. He does go outside, shutting the door behind him. Grandma looks a little bit sad, until she notices me looking at her; she starts smiling again.\n\n\"Don't worry, honey. Grandpa isn't feeling very well right now.\" She says, continuing to eat.\n\nI try to keep eating my dino-nuggets, but I can't help but feel sad. I don't want to let him be outside alone if he's not feeling well. I decide to stand up, too; Grandma looks at me as I start leaving the table.\n\n\"Amber, what are you doing?\" She asks.\n\nI turn around, puffing my chest up as I say proudly, \"I'm going to cheer Grandpa up!\"\n\nGrandma looks like she wants to say something to me, but just smiles and nods. I walk out of the dining room and towards the front door, following his steps. I open the door, looking outside; Grandpa is sat upon the steps of the porch, holding his magazine in one hand and a smoking stick in the other. He turns his head toward me, surprised to see me, before I practically jump toward him.\n\n\"Grandpa, Grandpa! What's wrong?\" My shouts echo father than I intended them to, but nobody else in the neighborhood is outside. He looks at me, and his eyes look sad before he turns away again.\n\nHe whispers, \"Amber, honey.. I'll be in soon.\"\n\nRight before I begin my impassioned speech about honesty, trust, and love, I take a deep breath. Suddenly, I start coughing in disgust, waving a hand around my head. Grandpa looks to the smoking stick in his hand, dropping it to the floor and crushing it with his shoe as he mutters, \"Sorry about that.\" With the smoke gone, I can speak again.\n\n\"Grandpa, I think you're sad. Aunt Rosa always says boys hide it when they're sad. What happened?\" I ask. He doesn't look at me, he just keeps staring off into the distance somewhere. I continue to stare at him with an unerring gaze, hoping to get some kind of response.\n\nEventually, he sighs and says, \"Honey, a good friend of mine.. left town a few weeks ago. I'm upset about it. That's all.\"\n\nI frown, and decide to sit on the steps next to him. I know what it's like to lose friends, too. To cheer him up, I tell him, \"Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm sure you have lots of friends, so I think you'll be okay.\"\n\nTo my disappointment, my words don't seem to help; he makes a very flat face before saying, \"At my age, you start to run out.\"\n\nI don't know what it's like being old, but I do know how friends act. I decide to show one of my best friends in the whole world how I feel; I give him as big of a hug as I can from the side. He turns his head towards me again. \n\nMy words come straight from my heart; \"No matter what happens, you'll always be my friend.\"\n\nFinally, Grandpa starts to smile. After a bit, he starts to hug me, too; I feel happy that I made one of my best friends feel better. As we're wrapped up together, he utters the words, \"Thanks, Amber.\"\n\nWe hold each other for a long time. Eventually, we start to let go of each other, but I keep leaning my head on his arm. He looks at his magazine again, and I get a good look at it this time. The cover has a human man swinging some kind of metal club. I only recognize it when I read the word \"GOLF\" written in big white letters on the top of the page.\n\n\"Oh! I love minigolf!\" Lifting my head off of his arm, I look at Grandpa and excitedly ask him, \"Do you like minigolf? We should go minigolfing!\"\n\nHe looks at me, then back to the magazine. Then back to me, then back to the magazine. Finally, he just looks at me, and another smile creeps onto his face. He starts to look just as excited as I am, and even laughs a little bit.\n\n\n\"Yeah, honey. We can go minigolfing.\"\n\n\n~END~\n","Title":"The Queen","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Amber, Samantha and Ripley","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"}},"Reed And Reeda":{"A Reedy Mix-Up Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Reed And Reeda","A Reedy Mix-Up Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Monday rolls around, and I am still riding that glorious afterglow\r\nI stride into the cafeteria like an absolute champion, grabbing the most expensive lunch I see\r\nI'll have to pay for this later, but fuck it. Keep the good times rolling\r\nTrish glares at me as I practically skip to my usual seat, my apparent happiness a personal insult to her\r\nFuck off trigger, this good mood is indestructible\r\nFang and Reed are already seated with their meals. Looks like Reed is back to his usual self too, chomping away at his lunch\r\nI merrily tap away an impromptu tune with my spork between bites of overpriced macaronni, even humming a few notes here and there\r\nDamn it feels good to be a gangster\r\n\"Jeez Anon, you're in a good mood today. Something happen?\" Fang asks, smiling\r\n\"I guess you could say that.\" I answer coyly, \"I feel like a new man today. Feels real good too.\"\r\nFang playfully punches my shoulder as Trish rolls her eyes, scoffing. Reed puts down his spork and leans against his fist, looking straight at me\r\n\"So Anon...\" He asks, making perfect eye contact, \"Did you, like...fuck my sister?\"\r\nThe spork falls right out of my hands, Fang audibly chokes on her drink\r\nThe entire world comes to a crashing halt\r\nThe good times are dead forever. Only darkness remains.\r\nTrish's face flashes through shock, anger, envy, arousal, then settles back on seething anger\r\nFang's jaw just opens and closes like a fish\r\nAnd Reed... Reed just stares directly into my soul\r\nHis expression and posture are both so calm, but those eyes. Lord, I can tell he's deathly serious\r\nOh sweet Raptor Jesus...\r\nHow does anyone explain to their bro they just spent half the weekend doing the horizontal monster-mash with his nearly identical gender-swapped twin sibling?\r\nThis shit is not covered in dating sims. I am not prepared for this\r\nAs the seconds tick by, Reed just continues to stare unflinchingly at me\r\nOh god, he knows. He can't *not* know. Each passing second of silence is another undeniable mountain of evidence burying me forever.\r\nI need to say something. Anything. JUST SPEAK.\r\n\"Uh...\" I lamely mumble, voice monotone as a robot\r\nGreat. Brilliant. Flawless delivery.\r\n\"Oh my god, you fucked Reed's sister??\" Trish shouts, standing up and slamming her hands on the table\r\n\"Sshh!\" I shush her. People are already starting to turn their heads. I'm sure at least some of them heard that just now.\r\nTrish sits back down and crosses her arms, glaring at me with barely restrained fury\r\n\"See Fang? This is why men are all trash.\" she complains, nodding in my direction\r\nWell fuck you too Trish\r\n\"Well, I don't know...\" Fang replies, her voice sounding faintly forced to me, \"I guess it's not really a problem. Is is a problem, Reed?\"\r\nOh fuck that's right, Reed\r\nHe's still just staring at me, with those calm yet terrifyingly intense eyes\r\n\"Naaaah, Of course not!\" He says, finally snapping out of...whatever the hell that was. \"Anon's like... free to do whatever, man.\"\r\nRiiiight, because that was totally convincing\r\nStill though, Reed's not one to hold a grudge or lie. If he says it's fine then... it probably is?\r\n\"Well okay then, thanks for being cool about this bro.\" I offer him a fist-bump, although I could have sworn he hesitated for a split second before meeting it\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMath goes by without much trouble, although oddly Reed didn't offer to help out with the worksheet today\r\nI didn't really need the help after all, but it's strange. Usually he offers before I can even ask\r\nFang seems distant in music class too, but why would she be mad? Am I just overthinking everything again?\r\nThe final bell rings, and I can't help but think things are far from over\r\nAs I grab my backpack and head out into the hall, I'm surprised to find Reed already waiting there for me\r\n\"Hey Anon, you got a minute?\" He asks, falling in step beside me as I head for my locker\r\n\"Sure man, what's up?\" I ask as he wraps an arm around my shoulder. Something far in the back of my mind is flashing warning signs, but I can't put my finger on what's wrong\r\n\"I just wanted to check up my bro!\" He laughs casually, tightening his grip around my shoulder. Those warning signs are now screaming that something is very wrong\r\n\"Reed, what the heck are you doing?\" I demand as he forcibly steers me down the wrong hallway. I can't struggle out from under his arm as he marches me to the auditorium doors\r\n\"Relaaaaax man, we're bros right?\" Reed asks, his relaxed tone at odds with his iron grip, \"Bros don't do anything to hurt each other, right?\"\r\nReed shoves me against the metal doors and slams his foot square into my back, sending me sprawling and tumbling down the shallow auditorium steps\r\n\"RIGHT, BRO??\" Reed shouts as I struggle to get my feet, his face contorted in rage and his fists clenched at his sides\r\n\"What the hell Reed??\" I shout back, wincing as several future bruises begin to clearly introduce themselves, \"What did I ever do to you?\"\r\n\"You fucked my goddamn sister Anon!\" Reed snaps, stomping down the stairs. Holy crap, Reed is goddamn terrifying when he's angry.\r\nThis is so messed up, Reed is supposed to be the most laid-back dude in school. Seeing him this enraged is just...wrong!\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry man, alright?\" I plead, backing up as Reed angrily approaches, \"It's not like I planned it or anything! It just...happened!\"\r\n\"It just happened??\" Reed repeats, grabbing the collar of my shirt, \"What, you tripped out of your goddamn pants or something? You just 'accidentally' railed my sister for an entire weekend?\"\r\n\"Calm the hell down man!\" I desperately paw at the iron grip on my shirt, \"C'mon Reed! It's me, your bro!\"\r\n\"Bros don't fuck another bro's sister!\" He snarls, the feathers on his batting tail standing straight up like a feral cat\r\nI blubber incoherently as I try to think of some way to escape this with my skin intact\r\nBut when it really comes down to it, there's just no excuse for what I did\r\n...but why should I even have to excuse it?\r\n\"You know what Reed?\" I ask, wrenching his hand of my collar, \"Yeah, I fucked your sister. I fucked your sister every way under the goddamn sun.\"\r\nReed just looks stunned now, he didn't expect me to just own up to it like that.\r\n\"I plowed her like an Amish cornfield!\" I shout, the words rolling off my tongue like an avalanche, \"I plundered that pink raptor booty like motherfucking Blackbeard!\"\r\nI know I should stop, I've already pushed this too far, but this feeling of pride and bravado is addictive. I can't stop myself.\r\n\"I slapped her ass, pulled her tail, ate that muff, and dumped my load in there for *days*!\" I rant, looking Reed straight in the eye, \"And she LOVED IT!\"\r\nReed is literally shaking with rage, his teeth bared in an animalistic grimace. He looks like he's about to burst a blood vessel\r\nHe is seconds away from a serious homicide attempt. There is no way to talk him out of it now.\r\nBut fuck it, bring it on Reed! I'M READY FOR YOU, MOTHERFUCKER\r\nAs Reed and I prepare to pounce on each other like bloodthirsty animals, the auditorium doors slam open\r\nReeda stands at the top of the stairs, arms crossed over her chest and scowling down at us\r\n\"Reed...\" She sighs, rolling her eyes and walking down, \"Like, what the fuck are you doing?\"\r\n\"Reeda?\" I blurt out, not sure if I should be thankful for her intervention, \"What are you doing here?\"\r\n\"I came to walk home with my brother.\" Reeda explains, staring Reed down, \"But now I want some answers.\"\r\n\"Stay out of this Reeda.\" Reed snarls, his eyes darting between me and his sister, \"Just wait outside for a sec.\"\r\n\"No.\" Reeda snaps, growing more agitated, \"You don't tell me to 'stay out of it'.\"\r\n\"This is between me and Anon!\" Reed yells back, turning away from me to face her, \"This isn't about you.\"\r\nI'm starting to get the feeling Reed might have a more complicated reason to be mad right now\r\n\"Really?\" Reeda asks, \"Because it looks like you're about to tear him apart over what we did.\" \r\n\"News flash bro.\" She steps up to Reed, jabbing him in the chest with her finger, \"You don't get to dictate who I hang out with, or what I do with them. Got it?\"\r\n\"That's not-\" Reed falters, losing his composure, \"I mean- Anon wasn't supposed to be just another one of your-\"\r\n\"Another *what*??\" Reeda snaps, snarling, \"You're really going to stand there and criticize how I live my life? You?? At least I'm not blasted off my ass from Carfetanyl all day!\"\r\n\"Uuuugh!\" Reed groans, throwing back his head, \"Why can't you just get off my case! You sound just like Mom now!\"\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Reeda retorts, \"Well, you're starting to look just like Dad!\"\r\nOoooh damn. I don't know much about Reed's home life, but anyone could tell that was the verbal equivalent of an atomic bomb.\r\nReed looks like he just got punched in the gut. Reeda continues to stare him down, but there are the undeniable flashes of regret just under the surface\r\nReeda turns on her heel and storms out, her face flushed with anger and shame\r\nReed drops like a puppet with his strings cut, his arms and tail hanging limp and lifeless\r\nThis is probably a good time to make my escape. There's still a chance Reed may decide to murder me after all\r\nI quickly jump up the stairs and head out after Reeds\r\nThe school hallways are all empty by now. Nobody sticks around after school without a good reason.\r\nReeda is sitting out on the front steps of the school, flexing her fingers and angrily thumping her tail against the ground\r\n\"You okay?\" I ask, instantly berating myself for asking such a dumb question. Of course she's not okay\r\n\"I'm fine.\" She lies, running her hand through her hair and smiling up at me.\r\nHot damn, that smile. It's my Achilles heel. I don't think I'll ever forget the way she had smiled down at me before,  as she pinned my arms above my head and straddled my waist\r\nDammit Anon, get your head out of the gutter. This isn't the time for happy reminiscing\r\n\"Do you think Reed is going to be okay?\" I ask, taking a seat beside Reeda on the concrete\r\n\"Pfft, yeah. He'll be fine.\" Reeda scoffs, blowing a loose lock of hair out of her vision, \"He's probably already half through another damn thermos by now. He'll forget all about this by tomorrow.\"\r\nSomehow I doubt that. Reed looked absolutely devastated back there. I doubt even he could just cleanly bounce back after something like that.\r\n\"Reed and I used to be inseparable.\" Reeda explains, looking wistful, \"Until our parents split up anyway. Then I went with Mom and he stayed here and... I dunno man, shit's complicated.\"\r\nWell, that begins to explain it. It's not hard to draw the inevitable conclusions from there.\r\nStill, with everything that just happened, there are some questions that need answering.\r\n\"Sooo...\" I drawl, uncertainty rising as I delve into uncharted waters, \"Where does that leave...us, exactly?\"\r\n\"Us?\" Reeda repeats, looking at me with confusion.\r\nShe's just looking at me, like I had just asked a question in another language.\r\nWait, what is happening right now? Something about this suddenly fills me with dread.\r\n\"Dude, you're like, cute and all...\" Reeda begins, her words dropping into my stomach like lead, \"But this was just like, a fling or something. I need to head back home tomorrow.\"\r\n\"Oh...\" I numbly reply, mouth suddenly dry\r\nJust a fling... was that all this was? Just two teenagers having fun with each other?\r\nI had never asked Reeda what she wanted out of all this, but the way she looked at me during those nights... I had just assumed...\r\nWas this just a quick diversion for her? Something to pass the time?\r\nDid it really just mean nothing?\r\nWhat was it that Reed said earlier?\r\n*Anon wasn't supposed to be just another one of your-*\r\n\"I had fun though man.\" Reeda slaps my back, standing up and stretching, \"Shoot me your number sometime, I'll let you know when I'm back in town.\"\r\n\"Yeah...sure.\" I reply, my own voice sounding like it's coming from the far end of a long tunnel\r\nReeda breezes down the concrete steps, a sway in her hips and not a care in the world. That sight would have driven me wild a minute ago, but now...\r\nI feel like a disgusting piece of used trash. I want to hurl. I want to scream and pull all these vile feelings out of my gut\r\nI bury my face in my hands, swallowing down the rising twisting tension in my throat\r\nCome the fuck on, Anon. Just what did I think this all was anyway? Did I really expect a girl like that to just fall into my lap so easily?\r\nMan up you pussy. At least I got laid. At least I won't die a virgin now.\r\nWhy did I have to be such a goddamn moron and get all attached so easily? Be a fucking man already and suck it up.\r\nBut Reed...\r\nOh god, Reed...\r\nI had forgotten all about Reed. I had just completely abandoned my bro. I had broken the most sacred testament of the bro-code\r\n'Bros before Hoes'\r\nI am such a goddamn piece of shit...\r\nThe front doors open behind me and somebody approaches slowly. Their footsteps are hesitant, but eventually they sit down on the steps beside me\r\n\"Damn, are you okay Anon?\" Fang asks, putting her hand on my shoulder, \"You look like shit.\"\r\nThat really has to be the stupidest question in the world. Nobody ever asks that when they don't already know the answer\r\nI nod weakly, barely looking up out of my hands. I don't trust myself to speak just yet\r\nFang follows my gaze to the distant patch of pink feathers just barely dropping out of view in the distance\r\n\"Oh Anon, she got you good didn't she?\" Fang drapes a wing around my shoulders, pulling me in against her side like a protective hen\r\nI don't have the strength to resist, or even argue. Fang seems tense, like she isn't quite sure what she's doing, but I'm too broken to pass up even the slightest bit of sympathy.\r\n\"Shit, I'm sorry Anon, I should have warned you about her.\" Fang apologizes, awkwardly patting my head with her hand. \"You're not a complete jerk, you didn't deserve to get chewed up and spit out like that.\"\r\nI sniff, swallow hard and take a long shuddering breath. I'm starting to slowly get myself back under control, time to get my shit together here. I can deal with all this later.\r\n\"Thanks Fang.\" I sniff again, wiping my sleeve across my eyes, \"Coming from you, that's some really high praise.\"\r\n\"Yeah yeah,\" Fang waves it off, retracting her wing, \"Don't mention it. Seriously, don't. I have a reputation to uphold around here. Don't want every crybaby in school trying to gunk up my feathers.\"\r\nThat at least gets a weak chuckle out of me. Fang's smile is infectious, and I can't help but feel a little better seeing it.\r\n\"Got it, I'll make sure nobody finds out you're secretly a big softy.\" I tease, standing up and brushing off my jeans\r\nFang sticks her tongue out at me, rolling her eyes. She stands up and heads down the steps onto the sidewalk, waving goodbye as she begins her walk home\r\nI honestly didn't expect that from Fang. She didn't seem the type to offer her shoulder to cry on. Now that I think about it, she had probably stayed behind after school on purpose\r\nAll I really want to do right now is head home, but sadly my day is likely far from over\r\nReed is still inside somewhere, abandoned by his bro. I need to get in there and make things right with him\r\nHopefully I can still salvage things between us. I owe it to him to at least try."},"A Reedy Mix-up Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Reed And Reeda","A Reedy Mix-up Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: A Reedy Mix-Up \nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Reeda, Reed, Fang, Trish and Anon\nRating: Semi-NSFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: Anonymous\nSummary: Anon and Reed were supposed to hang out. Instead, the human gets quite the surprise.\n\n\nThe last week of month two at Volcano High is nearly over\nAt this point, I've pretty much resigned myself to be a member of \"the gang\" with Trist, Fang, and Reed\nCould be worse, I suppose. Could be a lot better though.\nTrish is still an insufferable trigger bitch, but Fang and Reed almost make up for her company\nEspecially Reed, he's surprisingly pretty good bro material. The very definition of \"chill\"\nFor better or for worse\nI cruise into the cafeteria and work through the omnivore line\nThank Raptor Jesus for this lunch card. Definitely not thanking Naomi though\nFriday is a good day, and a good day like Friday deserves pizza\nEspecially this Friday\nReed offered to hang out after school and, \"Smash some soda and dominate Rock Ring on Xrox like good bros should.\"\nI had found the offer surprisingly hard to refuse, and now I'm actually kind of looking forward to it\nHanging out with my stoner bro after school, almost like a regular person. Dad would be so proud.\nNormally I would be hesitant to show my shitty apartment to anyone, but Reed won't judge. He's cool like that\nFang and Trish are sitting over at the usual table, and at this point I don't bother trying to contrive a reason to go elsewhere\nTrish gives me her usual optical homicide attempt as I sit down, Fang giving me a brief \"Sup, Anon?\" as greeting\nThe two of them continue talking about nothing in particular as I enjoy the cheesy pleasure of real, drywall free pizza\nTrish is probably trying another thinly veiled attempt to get Fang to switch back to bass, but Fang is pretty well inoculated against that by now\nAlas, the Italian ambrosia is quickly consumed, and I'm left with nothing to occupy myself with\nTrish and Fang are enjoying their own meals in content silence now. It seems nobody has much to talk about.\nIt's not an awkward silence, It's peaceful. It's also dull\nNormally this would be about the time when I pull out my phone and bait some edgy fourteen year-old on a Peruvian oyster shucking forum\nBut I forgot to charge my phone last night. It's sitting on my makeshift nightstand back home.\nSpeaking of, where the heck is Reed? He's usually here by now.\n\"Sup dudes?\" A familiar voice asks from behind me\nReed slides into his seat beside Trist and- Wait, that's not Reed\nReed's voice isn't that high pitched and melodious\nReed's hair (feathers?) aren't that long\nReed's hips aren't that wide\nReed's chest isn't that BIG\n\"Hey Reeda, how's it going?\" Fang asks, fist bumping the pink raptor impostor sitting across from me\nWait, 'Reeda'? Who the fuck is Reeda?\nFang, Trish, and Reeda (apparently) easily slide into another conversation, but my brain is too fried to follow it\nAm I having a stroke?\nAm I being punked?\nDid somebody spike my drink?\nHow are these two just talking to this chromosome swapped Reed impersonator like it's the most normal thing in the world?\nThis can't be Reed, right?\nI mean, the clothes are mostly the same, except for that bandanna in her hair and the way she tied up her tank top\nThe hairstyle is similar too, just longer and a bit more girly\nHer mannerism are perfectly identical to Reed's, and her voice is so eerily similar.\nJust more lightweight, almost musical...\n\"Hey Anon, do I have... like, something on my face?\" Reeda asks\nI snap back to reality, just now noticing the conversation has died and everyone is looking at me\nOh god, I've been staring at Reeda this entire time\nShit, do I say something? Do I accuse her of being some gender confused body snatcher?\nTrish and Fang don't seem fazed by this in the slightest. Is this some raptor thing? Has this happened before and they're just used to it?\nFine, play it cool Anon. Don't rock the boat. Just stay calm and ride this crazy nightmare until it's over\n\"Uh, no. It's nothing, I was just thinking about stuff\"\n\"Hey man, that's cool.\" Reeda replies, smirking in that unmistakably Reed-like way, \"Thinking's important and stuff\"\nThankfully the bell rings before I can make a complete ass of myself again\nI grab my bag and powerwalk out of there, heading straight for class\nThis can't be normal, right? People don't just suddenly swap genders. Not even dinosaurs are that weird\nI need to clear my head, and approach this rationally. Maybe there's a biology textbook I can snag somewhere that can explain this tomfuckery\n\"Yo Anon! Where's the fire bro?\" Reeda asks, jogging up to my side. \"You totally bolted out of there man.\"\nDamn it, that's right. Reed(a) and I have math class together right after lunch\n\"Sorry, I was uh... excited for the weekend.\" I lamely replied, hoping she would buy it\n\"I getcha man, it's cool\" Reeda grins, nudging me with her elbow, \"You still good to hang out tonight?\"\nThat's right, tonight. The quality hang-out time I planned with my bro\nWho is no longer a bro\nWho is now a chick\nA chick that is absolutely rocking that tied off tank top and bandanna combo\nDAMMIT ANON YOU PUT THAT SHIT ON LOCKDOWN RIGHT NOW\nBROS ARE NOT FOR LEWD. YOU NEED TO END THIS IMMEDIATELY\nBut as I look at the adorably cheerful face of my former bro, I can't bring myself to crush that smile\n\"Yeah, sure!\" I assure her, trying to keep my voice from stammering, \"Wouldn't miss it.\"\nHer toothy grin somehow grows even wider as she offers a fist bump I couldn't possibly ignore\nHer skin definitely feels softer too\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nMath class was an entirely new type of hell completely unknown to me before today\nMr. Carldewskii had everybody split into work groups while he read his clearly academic and intellectual adult literature\nWhich meant I was paired with Reeda for the entire class\nWho I swear made it a point to repeatedly lean over my desk at every possible opportunity\n\"Jeez Anon,\" Reeda laughed, erasing my failed attempt at calculus, \"You really do suck at this\"\n\"Thanks, Y-You too\" I stammered\nBy the time class was over I had to rush into the bathroom just to wipe the sweat off and stuff my spaghetti firmly back into my pockets\nI need some way to escape this afternoon. There's no way I could survive hours alone with this monstrosity\nI tried to think of some possible excuse throughout the entire last period of the day, but nothing plausible came to mind\nAs I stepped down the school front steps into a swelteringly hot afternoon, I thought over the whole thing one more time\nReeda is still my bro deep down, right?\nMy bro who might be going through a tough time\nI should really be there for her right now\nGive her a shoulder to lean on\nMaybe hold her if things get-\nOKAY NOPE THIS SHIT NEEDS TO END RIGHT NOW\nJust let her down gently with some vague excuse, he (she?) will get get over it\n\"Heeeey Anon!\" Reeda waves from across the lawn, holding an entire 24 pack of off-brand soda on one shoulder while smiling broadly\nI must protect this smile\n\"You want me to carry that?\" I ask, gesturing to the shrink wrapped soda cans as we set off down the sidewalk\n\"Don't worry bro, I got this.\" Reeda answers, flexing her other arm, \"Gotta work on the guns, you know?\"\n\"Yeah, right.\" I agree, not really able to relate in the slightest\nThe walk down to Skin Row takes less than an hour, but that's plenty of time under the unbearable sun\nI wipe the sweat from my brow and and fan out my shirt, silently cursing that damnable ball of plasma\n\"Hot enough for ya bro?\" Reeda teases, readjusting the soda on her shoulder\n\"The sun sucks hot ass, it needs to die\" I complain, turning to Reeda, \"Are you sure you don't want me to take that-\"\nThe sentence dies on my lips as a glimpse Reeda's soaked tank top clinging to her chest, a sporty black bra clearly visible beneath the fabric\nI tear my gaze away immediately, hoping she didn't notice me ogling her chest for what must be the hundredth time today\n\"You okay Anon?\" Reeda asks, tilting her head, \"You're like, all red and stuff.\"\nRaptor Jesus save me from this nightmare\nFinally we reached my apartment. I fumbled with my keys as we walked up the steps to my front door\nI didn't mind showing my place to Reed, but now that...\"this\" happened I'm suddenly self conscious\nPushing the door open, a cool breeze of air conditioned air caresses my face like a gentle lover\nAt least I thought to clean up a bit yesterday, so the place isn't a total sty\nReeda drops the soda down by the door, rolling her shoulder as she looks around your apartment\n\"Damn dude,\" She whistles, \"This is like, a total bachelor's pad man. I love it.\"\n\"Are you kidding?\" I ask, tearing a couple sodas out of the packaging, \"This place is a total dump in the worst part of town.\"\n\"Yeah, but like, it's your dump you know?\" Reeda continues, dropping down to sit on your bed, \"You've got your own place while in highshool. That's like... totally rad, bro.\"\nI quickly carry the sodas into the kitchenette, hoping the heat rising on my face wasn't too visible\nOpening the fridge, I push some old pizza boxes aside to make room for the sun-warmed soda, swapping them out for some older ice cold cans\nHeading back into the bedroom, I toss Reeda one of the cans and get seated on the floor\n\"Thanks bro.\" Reeda smiles, pressing the cold can against her forehead\n\"Oh yeah, that's the stuff\" she sighs, sliding the dripping can down to her snout while her tail happily thumps against the mattress\nHoly merciful god does this raptor ever stop\nMy best bro can't possibly be this cute\nI try to distract myself by setting up the Xrox, but there's no denying what I feel deep inside anymore\nGod help me, I want to fuck this raptor\nI hand one of the controllers up to Reeda and lean up against the bedframe \nAt least dominating some preteens on team deathmatch will distract me from the pink feathered succubus lounging on my bed\nThat's what I thought anyway, until an oversized pink feather duster draped down onto my shoulder\nThe pink feathers on Freeda's tail tickle my cheek, and it almost seems like she's trying to pull me closer\nStay cool Anon, stay cool. Just keep the spaghetti on lockdown and focus on the game\nA couple online matches go by without a hitch, before long I'm casually shooting the shit with Reeda like nothing's changed\nShe's definitely still my bro, despite it all\nA couple times Reeda gets up to grab more soda or snacks, and I'm even able to keep my eyes off her swaying ass when she does\nMost of the time anyway\nHer tail still finds it's place on my shoulder when she returns though. It's strangely comforting, maybe a little possesive even.\nAfter a couple hours, I put the controller down and stretch my sore arms overhead\nSurprisingly Reeda grabs my wrists, holding them in place above my head\nBefore I can say anything, Reeda's hot breath tickles my ear as I hear her shift on the bed behind me\n\"So, Anon...\" Reeda whispers, her voice honeyed and teasing, \"I noticed you were like, totally checking me out today.\"\nSweet Raptor Jesus this is Defcon 1\nMan all battle stations!\nTHIS IS NOT A DRILL\nI can just barely see the tip of Reeda'a snout in my peripheral vision as the end of her tail thumps against my chest\nI can't move\nI can't think\nBrain.exe has encountered a critical error and must shutdown\n\"Dude, I've been dropping hints like crazy all day.\" Reeda teases, tightening her grip on my wrists \"I finally figured I would need to make a move for you.\"\nReeda's snout rubs against my cheek as she leans in closer, her tail wrapping more tightly around my chest\n\"What do you say bro?\" She coos, audibly licking her lips, \"Want to have some real fun?\"\nThe room feels like it's suddenly twenty degrees hotter\nEverything in my body has gone ramrod stiff\nIncluding Anon.Jr, who stands primed and ready for action\nReeda moans seductively as she leans back, gently nibbling on the top of my ear\nOh god I'm going to fuck the raptor\n\"Please be gentle Reed...\" I whisper, resigning to my fate\nReeda's tail instantly loosens, her head pulling back suddenly\n\"Reed?\" she repeats\nOh shit\nOh shit, I fucked it up\n\"I mean, uh..\" I stammer, pulling my arms out of her grip and scooting away from the bed, \"What I meant to say was, uh...\"\nSurprisingly Reeda doesn't look hurt, in fact she just looks confused\n\"Why did you say 'Reed'?\" she asks, cocking her head, \"Wait, dude... do you have a thing for my brother??\"\nWait a fuck\nBrother?\nWhat the fuck does she mean brother??\n\"Wait- Hold on. You're not- I mean-\" I try to get my fried brain the put these jumbled thoughts together\nNope, nothing. Brain is still in stupid mode\nShe must have figured out what I was trying to say, as her eyes go wide and she bursts into hysterical laughter\n\"Dude, you thought I was Reed??\" She laughs, clutching her sides and rolling around your bed. \"What, you thought he magically turned into a girl or something?\"\nThe sight of her laughing hysterically on the bed makes my ears burn with sudden shame\n\"Then why the flying fuck are you here??\" I demand, waving my arms hysterically\n\"My bro came down with like, the flu man.\" Reeda explains between bouts of laughter. \"Don't you read your texts?\"\nMy eyes snap to the phone I left charging on the nightstand this morning\nGrabbing it and tapping in my pin, sure enough I see several missed text messages from Reed\n> \"Sorry dude, super sick today. Can't make our bro-time.\"\n> \"Don't worry, my sis is back in town. I'll send her over to keep you company and stuff\"\n> \"Wouldn't want my best bro getting lonely and junk.\"\n> \"She'll meet you at school\"\n> \"Deuces (\u261e\u0e88\u0644\u035c\u0e88)\u261e\"\nI stare dumbfounded at the screen as Reeda slowly gets a hold of herself\n\"So... you're his sister?\" I ask numbly\n\"Sure am!\" She smiles, flashing a double peace-sign. \"Twinsies~!\"\n\"Wait, hold on.\" I continue, not quite willing to let this go yet, \"What about Trish and Fang, they acted like nothing was wrong!\"\n\"Well duh, my bro probably texted them.\" Reeda explains, rolling her eyes. \"It's not like, the first time we've met or something.\"\n\"What about math class?\" I demand, the realization that I've been a complete idiot all day slowly dawning on me\n\"It's not like I had anything else to do all afternoon.\" she shrugs, \"Besides, Reed said you're like, totally helpless with math and junk\"\n\"Reed talks about me?\" I ask, defeated. \"Is that why you acted like we've always known each other?\"\n\"Yeah, dude will not stop texting me about you.\" Reeda sighs, rolling onto her back. \"That guy hangs out with those girls way too much. I think he like, needs some guy time, y'know?\"\nThe weight of this monumental embarrassment comes crashing down like a lead weight onto my shoulders\nA twin sister, of course. I got carried away by my insane bullshit when there was a perfectly valid explanation right in front of me.\nGroaning in embarrassment, I hide my face in my hands and drop heavily onto the bed, unable to look at the world\nReeda sits up, chuckling to herself as she drapes an arm around me and leans into my shoulder\nI'm suddenly reminded that there is still a very attractive female raptor sitting on my bed\nThat just draped her arm around me\nAnd is gently nuzzling my cheek\n\"It's okay Anon.\" She consoles me, tracing circles across my chest with her finger, \"People like, make mistakes and junk.

But it's discovered Reeda actually had feelings for Anon as well.\n\n\n\"Bro, what the fuck!?\" Exclaimed Reeda, gripping the Xrox controller in her hands, trying to bend and snap it in half. \"I swear to fuck I'm gonna kill whoever invented dual-wielding needlers!\"\n\nI couldn't help but cackle. \"So why don't you just start using them too?\"\n\n\"Gamer code of honor, bro. I REFUSE to stoop so low.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say. Good luck getting out of Boulder-ranked lobbies with that attitude.\"\n\nShe waved me off, slightly agitated by my response, and started another match of Rock Ring while I sat on my bed and watched her play. At least this match wasn't such a travesty, her K\/D was positive and her team appeared to be winning so far. In the midst of her match, I went to the fridge to grab a soda.\n\n\"Yo, grab me one too?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure.\"\n\nI grabbed another can and joined her on the floor, passing her one of the off-brand sodas.\n\n\"Thanks, man.\"\n\nThe next couple of minutes mostly consisted of watching Reeda play more Rock Ring matches, swearing one after the other \"last match, I promise\". This happened a good 5 times before she finally sat the controller down, ending on a positive win-rate.\n\n\"Thanks for having me over, dude. Been meaning to come over for a while but never really got around to asking. You're a total bro, though.\"\n\n\"No worries, dawg. It's nice having friends over. Helps with the post-breakup depression, ya know?\"\n\nBringing up the break-up already was beginning to put a damper on my mood, especially reliving our exchange. Truth be told, I haven't been the same man since. While we agreed to stay friends, which I was thankful for, I just couldn't look at her the same way since. We'd talk a little here and there, but nothing like when we first developed feelings for each other and started going out. I even started skipping out on going to the auditorium a lot of the time because it just hurt so much to see her after the break-up, on top of the fact Trish was being an absolute cunt and basically rubbing it in my face that we didn't last. God, I fucking hate that purple trigger bitch. I wanna rip off those stupid fucking horns of hers and jam them into her eye sockets every time she so much as looks at me. Fucking bitch. Looking over to Reeda, I see her holding out a lit joint, blowing a ring of smoke at my face.\n\n\"Before you talk yourself into an existential crisis, let's get you mellowed out. I don't want my best friend trying to off himself.\" She gave the joint a little shake, further tempting me to take a load off.\n\n\"I really shouldn't, Reeda. But...\" I stared at the burning joint longingly as she took another hit, puffing the smoke in my face to give me another whiff of that premium quality kush, already feeling a bit more at ease from the contact. When she held it out to me once more, I happily took it. \"Thanks. I really could use one right now.\"\n\n\"No prob, amigo. That's what friends are for.\"\n\nI took a hit of the joint, sucking in some of that medicating smoke before hacking up a lung. It's been forever since I smoked anything, let alone weed. I need to get warmed up again. Reeda was having a snicker fit as I hacked, patting me on the back in a poor attempt at helping me out.\n\n\"C'mon don't be a pussy. Just a little kush, dude.\" She gave me a slap to the back, followed by a gentle rub as if she was trying to apply ointment to me or something.\n\n\"So...\" Reeda began, scooching closer to me. \"What's got ya so beat up as of late?\" One of her hands found my knee, giving me an assuring pat.\n\nFuck, we really were about to open up fresh wounds. At least the idea of talking about it didn't sound nearly as bad as before now that I got a bit of medication in me.\n\n\"Fuck, man... Where do I even begin?\"\n\n\"From the start. And I mean the VERY start of it, dude.\" The voice of Reeda had a dramatic shift. The usual stoned, almost hippy voice she normally used suddenly being forgotten, making it sound almost formal; corporate even.\n\nI took another hit of the joint, running it down to a pitiful nub while Reeda lit another one, taking the first hit of the newly lit blunt.\n\n\"Well, when we first started dating, I was super excited. Spaghetti falling out of my pockets, hands clammy, all that shit. I just wanted to be around her as much as possible. Thing is, I've never had a girlfriend before, so I wasn't sure of all the things to say or do. I just kinda awkwardly hung out with her and tried thinking of how I could, like, express myself or just connect with her. Eventually she just called it off. I was fucking devastated, dude-\"\n\nI took the blunt Reeda passed me, sucking down a good toke before continuing with my ramblings. Even with the tranquilizing affects of the herb, I could feel all my emotions begin pouring out from me, my eyes welling up with tears as I recollected one of the most dreadful days I've ever had. Even as I went on with my retelling, Reeda was silent, looking at me intently with her hand still on my knee, her grip noticeably tightening as a way of giving me reassurance that she was still listening. Maybe I should just stop here. I'm already feeling so emotionally exhausted\n\n\"I haven't been able to speak to her. I can't even bring myself to look her in the eyes. And she's my lab partner too, dude. I just get this immense feeling of dread, like at any moment she's about to start berating me for being a terrible boyfriend. She was like, the first person I developed feelings for and I blew it... I blew it, dude...\"\n\nI could feel my eyes further watering, the tears threatening to start pouring down my face as Reeda scooted even closer, her hand leaving my knee and wrapping around my shoulders as she pulled me in close.\n\n\"Am I really that much of a fuck up? Am I that terrible of a boyfriend that I can't even show Fang how much she meant to me? Fuck, dude... I'm the biggest fuck-up imaginable. I can't even keep the only girl who's ever liked me!\"\n\n\"Whoa whoa whoa, hold on, man. You need to stop this shit right now.\" Reeda shuffled around to put herself in front of me, a consoling hand on my shoulder while she pointed an accusatory finger right at my face. \"First off, you're beating yourself up WAAAAY too much, dude. You're just inexperienced, amigo.\" Her hand left my face and instead planted itself on my other shoulder, her weight pushing my back against the bedframe, basically leaving me trapped between her and my bed. \"Second, you're a fucking catch, dude. I can fucking PROMISE you Fang isn't the only girl who likes you.\"\n\nI cleared the tears from my eyes, sucking in a deep breath as I looked up towards Reeda who was giving me a somewhat comforting smile on top of her grip on my shoulders tightening. But even with that smile I was still having my doubts. Something told me she was just telling me this to make me feel better, but maybe there was a chance she was being authentic when she spoke. It was hard to say, given her red eyes. She was definitely somewhat stoned.\n\n\"I fucking doubt it's anyone I know, dude. Fang was-\"\n\n\"No bro, Fang isn't the only one who likes you. Think REEEEALLY hard. Who is it you see everyday? She ALWAYS talks to you...?\"\n\nWhat the fuck is she talking about? It's not fucking Naomi; she's got Naser. It can't be Trish; she fucking hates me. I doubt it's Rosa since we don't really talk... Maybe Stella? I doubt it since I'm pretty sure she was talking to the football captain...\n\n\"Then who the fuck is it!? I literally don't know anyone that would actually like me!\" At this point I was getting more livid than anything. Why the fuck is she trying to play the guessing game with me? I'm not in the fucking mood for this shit.\n\n\"Oh my fucking-\"\n\nBefore Reeda finished her sentence, her hands were pressed to the sides of my face, pulling me in, her lips sealing to my own, and her eyes closing in frustration, the same kind of frustration one had trying to explain the same thing to someone over and over again. In pure shock, I froze. Something about this felt oddly wrong, like my heart still belonged to Fang, like I was committing an unforgiveable sin. But the following moments began to cast light on my depressing haze, and soon I began to make the realization: It was her. She liked me. How could I have been so blind? Have I just been selling myself short this whole time? Was she sending me signals I never picked up? I don't know. What I did know, however, was that it was... comforting. I wasn't alone anymore. I was with one of my best friends. And she kept me in her embrace to let me know her feelings were authentic. My shoulders began to relax as my stupor wore off and I began to look through a clearer lens just as the kiss was broken. Her eyes opened up and revealed a glow of newfound passion, something which I had never actually seen in her before.\n\n\"It's me, Anon. You fucking idiot... I like you.\"\n\nHer voice was oddly dulcet despite the insult, like she was more thankful that she finally got to reveal her feelings for me. Then there was her pleading smile that bore the weight of her emotions as she saw me in such a miserable state; almost as if it caused her physical pain to see me in distress and her smile was the only thing she could offer to make me feel better. All this time I knew her, I never noticed the finer details of her being: Despite being a stoner, she didn't really smell like one. The cheap perfume she wore tingled my nostrils with a feint flowery, citrus smell. Her rather unkempt hair had a controlled chaos too it, tying together well with her choice of clothing; what with her black Warped Tour t-shirt with the sides cut open, which gave a pleasing view of her body and her bra, and her torn, slim jeans. And those eyes. Never before had I seen a purple as deep as those gorgeous eyes. I could practically swim in them. It was like her iris was chiseled amethyst. It was... beautiful.\n\n\"Reeda. I-\"\n\nI glanced down, realizing my hands had found themselves comfortable on her waist, my hold gentle yet firm to keep her from moving away from me. When our gazes met once more, her eyes seemed to soften and her pleading smile turned into a more hopeful one, as if she knew the very words I was about to speak.\n\n\"I- like you too...\"\n\nThe tug at my heart was palpable upon my utterance, to the point I could see the look Reeda gave me, assuring me she was there to give me the support I needed, which helped me to work past my apprehension to act further. Without much thought other than wondering if I was right in doing so, I began pulling my raptor friend into my lap, which was met with a little shuffle and scoot to place herself on my waist. This time, it was my turn to initiate, and pressed my lips to hers, Reeda's arms wrapping around the back of my neck while she met me half way in our lip lock. One of use breathed a sigh of relief, though it was likely me seeing as how my chest didn't feel so tight anymore. The next thing I realized, Reeda's tail was looped around my right leg, in addition to her head canting to the side to deepen our kiss, her raptor tongue even slithering past my lips as she pressed herself against my chest. My head naturally canted in response, the kiss deepening, and our mouths periodically opening to keep our embrace deep, the make-out session lasting another couple minutes as Reeda's fingers began to curl, her nails (or talons?) began raking my back, nearly tearing up my shirt. When our kiss finally broke, I was left to labor my breaths while my friend hardly had to catch her breath.\n\n\"You should really learn to not hold your breath, dude.\" She remarked, barely stifling a giggle as she looked down at me.\n\n\"It's... not my fault... you sucked the air... out my lungs...\" I retorted, then met with a playful slap to my chest.\n\n\"Not my fault my skinnie boyfriend is a good kisser.\" She chimed.\n\nI rolled my eyes, my face only growing slightly warmer from the compliment. All of a sudden, my mouth started tasting funny. I smacked my lips. Yeah, it tasted like weed, blegh.\n\n\"You good, dawg?\" She asked, rubbing my shoulders.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. Mouth tastes like weed though.\"\n\n\"Wanna wash that taste out with carnival food?\"\n\n\"No way, there's a carnival in town!?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah dude. It's down at the boardwalk. They got some killer funnel cakes.\" Reeda hopped out of my lap, leaving me rock-hard on the floor before she pulled me to my feet with a surprising amount of strength. \"I can teach you how to be the perfect boyfriend while we're at it, too.\"\n\nI fixed my boner, tucking it down one of my pant legs while Reeda observed me openly. \"Aight, I'm down.\" I stepped towards the door and held it open for her, my new girlfriend walking by and then groping my crotch.\n\n\"Nice cock.\"\n\nWell that certainly caught me off-guard. I can already tell this relationship is gonna be WAY different than my previous one. \"Thanks, I grew it myself.\"\n\nThe earned a snort of a laugh.\n\nOur trip to the boardwalk was rather short, really consisting of nothing more than Reeda giving me some pointers on how to be a good boyfriend, even giving me credit for holding the door open for her earlier. But she wasn't the only one to be giving someone pointers. Noting the games I spectated when Reeda was playing Rock Ring, I managed to give her some kind of advice, mostly telling her how to take different maps, weapon locations, and of course teasing her about not dual-wielding needlers, which she remained adamantly against. In any case, the walk was relaxing, especially in the company of my stoner girlfriend, perfect to take my mind off of Fang.\n\n\"Now, are you ready for the final test, Anon-san?\" Reeda asked, putting on what had to be, without a doubt, one of the most offensive Japanese accents I have ever heard.\n\n\"I think I'm ready.\"\n\n\"Excelente!\" We stepped through gateway, bringing use into the boardwalk where we could see carnival rides and booths set up. \"Your test staaaarts... Now! Quick, your girlfriend's got the munchies! What do you do?\"\n\n\"Easy. I take her to get some food.\"\n\nJust when I was about to grab her hand, Reeda pulled it away. \"Wrong! You're missing something important. What did you forget?\"\n\n\"Ok uhh- shit... I uhh... Oh! Where do you wanna eat?\"\n\n\"Correct!\" Reeda slinked up to my side, grabbing my arm possesively. \"Funnel cakes. Now.\" She growled, gripping my arm as we walked to a nearby food stand and ordered the necessary funnel cakes for the two of us, covering us both for the food not out of a way to score points, but out of the fact I was coming to enjoy her presence more and more.\n\n\"You know I could've just paid for my own, right Anon?\" Reeda questioned, plucking at her funnel cake with the plastic fork to get a bite.\n\n\"I know. Just felt like I should cover you since you gave me a free therapy session.\" I took a bite of my food, the greasy, powdered sugar-covered confection blessing me with saccharine bliss.\n\n\"Another 50 points for you, Anon. You're making great progress!\" She chimed, polishing off the last of her funnel cake. Holy shit she could put away food. \"Alright, step two, Anon. What's step two?\"\n\nAh shit, I was already starting to forget what she told me. Fuck, what was it? I began looking around, struggling to remember what exactly it was she told me. Eventually, my eyes spotted the various game booths, such as ring toss, balloon darts, basketball, the whole nine-yards. That's it!\n\n\"Step two: Gift giving is a quick way to boost a girl's mood.\"\n\n\"Bingo! Now go get your girlfriend a gift!\"\n\nI tugged Reeda along, her giggles causing me to smile and even share a chuckle or two of my own. Starting at the ring toss, I pitched an entire bucket of those cheap, plastic rings, even sharing some with Reeda, watching her bright smile grow as she laughed along with me and tried for one of those cheap stuffed animals that wasn't even worth the price of trying for. The next booth was for knocking over a stack of bottles, though due to my own ineptitude, I failed spectacularly and earned a couple of jeers from Reeda, and of course the booth attendant. However, I finally got my redemption when we got to the balloon popping booth, where I managed to nail all three balloons to my own shock.\n\n\"Holy shit, Anon! You did it!\"\n\n\"Holy shit, I did it?\"\n\nReeda clung to my side, jumping up and down and then planting a kiss on my cheek. Once she settled down, she perused the hanging assortment of cheap stuffed animal, her eyes eventually fixing on what would be an obvious choice for her: a stuffed bong.\n\n\"That one.\" She demanded, pointing straight at the stuffed bong.\n\nBefore I could even ask, the booth attendant tossed the prize to my raptor date, who gave me another kiss on the cheek before going off to ride some of the rides whose safety was rather questionable. It was a rather standard assortment of rides: Rickety roller coasters, spinning wheels, large hydraulic swings, one of those swinging pirate ships, and of course, a Ferris wheel decorated with colorful lights, which would be our final ride for the night. Boarding the ride, it brought us to a clich\u00e9 moment, where the wheel was gradually brining us up to its apex for one of those cheesy rom-com scenes that always seemed to prevail modern cinema. While the wheel continued to spin, Reeda and I were shooting the shit, some compliments being thrown my way to praise me for my performance in her 'tests', which hardly felt like such. More like just a date with some half-assed tutelage. Though I could see as plain as day she was having a great time, which seemed to resonate that it was a rare experience for her, even when she was stoned off her ass. While she sat there, taking selfies with her stuffed bong and me in the background, I wrapped my arm around her shoulders, pulling her closer to me before she settled in and leaned her head on my shoulder, taking one of my hands, and brushing her thumb along the top.\n\n\"Well done, young grasshoppa. You've done well so far.\" She murmured, putting on another offensively Japanese accent for a moment then dropping it upon crossing her legs. \"You learned the art of sating hunger, the art of gifting, and the art of making women happy. Now for your last test.\" Reeda leaned in, pressing her snout to my ear, her murmuring causing the hair on the back of my neck to stand on end. \"You're riding a Ferris wheel with your girlfriend and you're about to reach the top. What do you do?\"\n\nThere was no hesitation on my part. I turned her my head to face her and caught her lips with my own, locking her into an embrace just as we got an unhindered view of the bay and the Volcaldera skyline, our hands finding each other to hold one another in a tight embrace as Reeda leaned against me and pressing a hand against my chest. As much as I would have loved to carry that kiss along for another couple minutes, it was abruptly broken by the raptor, who left a parting bite and tug to my bottom lip.\n\n\"Congrats, dude. You're now the best boyfriend in the world and passed the test with flying colors.\" She cooed, her voice noticeably more husky. \"And now you get to get to reap the benefits. Close your eyes.\" She commanded, pressing her hand more firmly against my chest, shoving my back against the side wall of the carriage we sat in.\n\n\"What, you gonna gift me a cassette you secretly made me?\" I asked, pushing back against her, only to be shoved right back against the wall.\n\n\"Close. Your. Eyes.\" She walked her fingers up my chest with each methodical and commanding word, pressing a finger against my lips to silence me.\n\nI gave a sigh and relented, Reeda then half-suppressing a laugh as hand gently dragged down my lips, my chin, my throat, chest, stomach an- wait. Was she really about t- OHGODOHFUCKOHGODOHFUCKOHGODOHFUCKITSHAPPENING. Her hand grabbed my groin to my horror and arousal. Right here? In public? On a Ferris wheel? Maybe it was a mistake. Any second now she'll probably move it to my thigh or- wait why is she rubbing my groin? Oh fuck... She's really going for it. And for some reason, my hands aren't trying to push her away.\n\nMy mind was swimming in all sorts of lewd images and thoughts while I was being toyed with, her hand sensually caressing me to the point I felt a stir in my loins, causing me to quickly go to half-mast, with a delighted \"oh\" coming from the raptor temptress. Her ministrations continued, her hand actively squeezing my concealed shaft and concentrating to pressure of her petting along the zipper. My breathing hitched the moment I realized her hand was now tearing at my jeans, the fly opening and the button being undone. As I opened my eyes, Reeda caught me and pried my eyelids right back down.\n\n\"No peeking.\" She snapped playfully, my scarousal keeping my eyes shut as I let her do what she wished.\n\n\"Are you sure you wanna do this? On the ride? We're gonna reach the bottom soon...\"\n\n\"No one will know except the two of use, bro. That's why I pushed you back. No one will see anything except a cute couple...\"\n\nAs I tried to interject, I was cut off by that familiar hand diving straight into my pants and right past my boxer briefs, seizing my manhood and giving it an affectionate squeeze.\n\n\"Daaaamn, bro. Where'd you get such a fat fuckin' cock? Is this all for me?\" She pried, giving my rod a shake.\n\n\"Holyshitpleasestopbeinggross.\"\n\n\"Awh come on, Anon? Don't like it when your girlfriend compliments you?\"\n\nBitch you know this is because you're jerking me off and saying nasty shit.\n\nAs I seethed about my predicament, Reeda moved on to straight up pumping my dick, her more delicate hands having a bit of fury to them as if she was performing an experiment to see how quick she could get me to blow my load. I could hear the idle chatter of other people as we reached what had to be the bottom of the ride, letting the wheel bring us past the other carnival goers waiting in line before we began going back upwards, the onslaught continuing as I tried my best to not drool all over myself. While in my lust-filled stupor, I could hear Reeda's tantalizing voice murmuring into my ear.\n\n\"You're so cute when you're trying not to nut. Just relax, Anon. You know you love this. Let it allllll out.\"\n\nHer voice had a subtle hiss to it as she tried to goad me. Not only was she right in saying that, deep down, I was loving this, but her teasing was working. To my own chagrin, her voice alone, what with it's breathy pleas and tantalizing whispers, brought me more pleasure than it should have. Hell, she could probably just talk to me this way and she wouldn't even need to touch me to get what she wanted. Even while I sat there trying to not bust a nut, she just HAD to make things worse for me by breathing against my neck, her hot breath washing over my skin which gave me goosebumps all over and forced a shuddering breath out of me. Her body started to press against mine, her muzzle pressing into my throat and nipping my flesh like she was trying to sample her prey before going in for the kill. Her fist began pumping faster and faster as that tightening sensation in my groin grew, marking the point of no return. My breathing became labored, and Reeda sensed my impending climax, capitalizing on the opportunity afforded to her by sucking and licking my throat. Never really thought something like that would do things to me, but... Fucking hell it felt so nice. I could already tell she was going to leave behind a massive hickey, but that was the least of my concerns. Before I knew it, I let out a groan against my on volition and felt the walls come crumbling down, erupting from the ministrations of my new girlfriend. To make matters worse, Reeda had planned for this and she had pointed my rod up towards my own stomach to paint myself like a canvas. While my ears practically rang from the first load I ever blew without my own hands being involved, I could hear a chuckle from the raptor as she slowly unraveled her fingers from me and dropped my shirt back down over my stomach. After finally opening my eyes, I covered my shame and quickly closed up my pants, catching my breath as I began to ruminate on what had just happened.\n\n\"Snrk. Imagine nutting on yourself.\"\n\nI punched her in the arm, which was met a devious cackle from the raptor before we hopped off the ride, my shirt sticking to my stomach which disgusted me to no end, like everyone knew what we did. Yet, at least to my knowledge, no one was aware of our doings just moments ago. I kept a hand on my neck, concealing the damp spot where a hickey was surely forming as we walked off, Reeda holding my other arm.\n\n\"Let's go back to your place, Anon. I'm not done with you yet.\"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. \"Shouldn't uh... Shouldn't you be going back home?\" I asked.\n\n\"After you got me all turned on like that, dude?\"\n\nCome to think of it, she did seem to be walking funny. Like she was squeezing her legs together or something, on top of gripping my arm extremely tight. The walk was rather quick considering Reeda was basically dragging me back to my apartment, her death grip on my arm while she was mumbling to herself and making a lot of strange, needy noises. Like something was stressing her out. Probably her being horny. When we got home, she burst through the door, shoving me in and locked it behind us, then grabbing me by my shirt and aggressively slamming her lips against mine, ramming her tongue into my mouth and beginning to grind her pelvis against me while pouring heated breaths against my lips. As much as I wanted to participate, I really couldn't. Reeda was almost violent with me, like she was upset I made her horny some how. The makeout session was abruptly ended, leaving a thin strand of saliva bridging our bottom lips until it snapped.\n\n\"Go clean yourself up, Anon. Then get your ass back here.\"\n\nNot wanting to keep my hot and bothered girlfriend waiting, I did just that. Jumping into the shower and scrubbing myself clean, I hopped right back out, wearing a tank top and sleeper pants and finding Reeda sitting on my bed and feeling up her chest, her thighs grinding together roughly even when she noticed me come out of the shower.\n\n\"Thank fuck, dude. I thought I was gonna die out here. Bed. NOW.\"\n\nI won't lie, seeing Reeda suddenly become so aggressive and dominant was a turn on. Taking my seat, I watched as Reeda began to strip, first bending over and working off her pants which was a struggle when it got down to her bubble of an ass. When she managed to work them off, I was left staring at a pair of black panties that were clearly extremely damp, along with a large portion of her inner thighs. The moment those panties were dropped, there was a rather long spiderweb of moisture that connected them, which snapped when her panties reached somewhere just above her knees.\n\n\"Damn it, Anon. You fucking ruined 'em. I'm gonna fucking kill you, dude. You owe me a new pair when I'm done with you.\"\n\nShe tossed the now-ruined panties into the growing pile of clothing on the floor, then turning to face me as she removed her bra from under her shirt, a glimpse of one of her pierced nipples flashing me for but a moment. Fuck. I love nipple piercings. Before I could ogle more at those gloriously pierced nipples, Reeda's hand pressed against my chest and she shoved me down onto my back, my legs being brought up to my bed as Reeda clambered on. My waist was promptly mounted, and I readied myself for what was bound to be losing my virginity, the prospect of which both excited and scared me, as I didn't have experience before aside from getting jerked off about half an hour ago. That idea was quickly dashed however, as Reeda began to climb over me. Leaving a damp spot on my sleeper pants, she crawled on all fours, bringing herself further and further up, her chest passing my head. Rolling my eyes down, I realized what was going on. Her knees planted themselves on either side of my face, and I was staring up at that painfully aroused slit. This was arguably even more terrifying than just straight up getting laid. I never contemplated a situation where I would have my face sat on by a smoking hot stoner raptor babe! I'm so fucking unprepared!\n\n\"Uh- um, uhh R-Reeda I-\"\n\nThat smell. Something about it seemed strange. While I had nothing in terms of one-to-one comparison, there were a few key subtleties that I began to pick up. It was rather pleasant, to say the least. At least it meant she was good at cleaning herself. It had a hint of some kind of floral scent, like she was wearing freshly washed clothing. Then there was that light musk. By no means was it a bad smell. It was just one of those smells people had that couldn't be scrubbed away. Like that smell of a t-shirt that had been worn all day that carried someone's very scent. Then a feint hint of sweat from the long day at the carnival, though not bearing the rancid or sour notes of someone unwashed. And then, there was the note of... something. I couldn't put my finger on it. All I know was that smell did something to me. Almost immediately I got a massive erection when I noticed it, like it was having some kind of physiological effect on me. I just couldn't get enough of it. Something about it was driving me up a wall and I just couldn't stop taking it in. Was this her pheromones? Was this her estrus season? My train of thought was interrupted by my vision growing darker as Reeda started to lower herself, the various scents growing stronger and stronger until it was all I could breath in once her slit met my lips.\n\n\"Stop. Talking. Dude.\" She commanded, her thighs squeezing the side of my head as she got some kind of pleasurable relief from her finding a seat on my face, only a liiiiiiiiiittle bit frustrated from the torture of her lack of release.\n\nI had never felt so helpless before. Being pinned to the bed under the weight of my stoner girl friend while she literally sat on my face wasn't really something I planned on happening, yet here I was, being suffocated by raptor pussy and thighs. The pheromonal scent continued to wash my mind into a lust-addled haze, on top of the now present taste of her on my lips. I was simply left there, inhaling her scent, and unsure of what to do, with Reeda taking in labored, shuddering breaths as she sat there. I don't think I've ever seen her like this. Scratch that, I NEVER have. She was like a whole different person; a puppet possessed by some insatiable demon with an appetite for carnal pleasures. While lost in my thoughts, Reeda's hips began to roll in short strokes, smearing my mouth in her heady sap as she took out her disenchantment on me, my hands finding purchase on her thighs as I wore them like a pair of headphones. The rhythm of her movements remained steady as she rode my face, my struggled breaths coming out as muffled groans as she more or less suffocated me like she was performing some kind of interrogation. But even while she sat their, grinding her cunt against me, I could see, well, as best I could through the haze that clouded my vision, that she was still incredibly frustrated as the pleasure she received just wasn't enough to satisfy her.\n\n\"D-damn it, Anon.\" She growled. \"Eat. Me. Out.\" Each word was capitalized with an aggressive grind of her hips, forcing her taste onto my tongue which paired well the with the pheromonal cloud that surrounded me.\n\nWithout much in the way of thought I dutifully obeyed her command and let out my tongue to lap at her dripping folds, which was met with a pleased groan and another roll of her hips. On top of that, a more raw taste of her secretions, which put my already fogging mind into a cascade of primal desires, my caveman brain screaming at me for more. Yet I literally have no idea what I'm actually doing so I just kept lapping away, using her continuous approving grunts as guidance as to whether or not I should keep working. The seconds turned to minutes, which ticked by so slowly that it felt like hours had passed, probably from the fact all I could really see aside from Reeda's cunt in my face was her reddened face as she huffed and groaned. Oh, and her sick thighs of course. Eventually I started to make the connection that her movements corresponded with her needs. So the hard she rode my face, the more aggressively I'd lap away at her aching folds. Yet still, she was only growing more and more frustrated, her eyes slammed shut and sweat dripping off her brow as she started riding harder, her thighs closing around my face in a tighter, vice-like grip with her hands grabbing the top of my head, fingers clawing at my scalp as she demanded more pleasure.\n\n\"Deeper... You fuck... Go deeper, dude.\" She hissed.\n\nAt this point she was starting to sound more furious at me than before, her hips grinding even harder, like she's trying to force me to devour her. Even my mattress is starting to move in the bed frame from her trying to get herself off on my tongue. At some point, I had to oblige her demand, and I figured it to be better sooner rather than later. Taking the plunge, I dive my tongue deep into her folds, as far as I can force it, which earned a suppressed moan from Reeda as she sank her teeth into her bottom lip, and her velvety inner walls clamping down as a surge of ecstasy surely ripped up her spine\n\n\"Fuuuuuck... Right there.\"\n\nYeah, that did the trick. And her motions surely echoed that theory as she began to let loose a set of raging bucks of her hips, the dampness coating my entire mouth, my nose, and my chin, more or less fucking herself on my own tongue as I tried my best to do whatever I could to help her out, whether it be flits and fans of my tongue or just straight up making out with her lower lips. To my own surprise, it was working as she nearly fell forward, forcing her hands to hold onto the headboard as she rocked her hips forcing my head to rock back with her as she more or less drowned me, sucking in deep breaths at any opportunity I had, which was growing far less frequently with the minutes ticking buy until she decided to just leave herself seated and just grind away at me until she either got her release, or was too frustrated to finish.\n\n\"C'mon... C'mon. Almost t-there... Fuckin'... Make me cum...\"\n\nAs soon as I was thinking of a way to help her out, she took matters into her own hand. I could hear the feint scraping of her nails on the wooden headboard which made me only slightly concerned as to what was coming next. What made me more concerned was how her thighs still managed to squeeze my head, giving me a deep headache that was so sharp, it felt like my head was about to pop like a water balloon. Breathing was no longer an option at this point. As hard as I tried, she was squeezing the life out of me and drowning me in a haze of her pheromones and juices. I was beginning to understand why it was dinos acted so weird during estrus season. Something about the smells and tastes was so intoxicating. Like I just couldn't get enough of it and was easily sliding down the pit of addiction. With an outright, primal growl she slammed her hips down on my lips again... and again... and again... and again. I was almost scared I was about to die between her thighs, but honestly, I'd have welcomed it. With the not-so-dry humping and the amorous grinding, it was only a matter of time I passed out. I could only hope it was after her climax. The seconds ticked by and things only got rougher from there, to the point I could feel not only my tongue, but my lips go numb and my headache growing sharper as she rode my face into the mattress, my vision becoming more and more tunneled as my peripherals began to fade, the only thing being seen now was her strained face that was drenched in sweat from a mixture of arousal and stress. And just when I thought I was about to pass out, her words echoed out into the room as she let loose a guttural moan, unrestrained by shame. With waves and flutters, I was soaked in a torrent of her ejaculate, which stained my face and even my neck as she rode out her climax, looking down at me with an almost shocked looked on her face, like she couldn't believe what just happened. Thankfully, she noticed I was about to die, and she lifted herself off my face, placing herself on my chest while I labored for fresh air.\n\n\"You... You good... Anon?\" She asked between pants, wiping the sweat off her forehead with her shirt and putting on a somewhat relieved smile.\n\nI took a minute to properly catch my breath, speaking up only after I felt like I wasn't going to pass out anymore. \"Y-yeah, I'm fine... Just thought I was about to meet Raptor Jesus for a moment... Fuck, dude. I thought you were trying to smother me to death. Can't even feel my face.\"\n\nReeda's face grew a tinge more red. \"Yeah, sorry about that, bro. I didn't realize it was my estrus season already. Coulda sworn it wasn't for another week or two.\"\n\nI waved my hand. \"Don't... sweat it. I just need a nap is all.\"\n\nReeda shook her head, grinning widely. \"Sorry, bro. But I ain't done with you yet.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, what?\"\n\n\"It's estrus season, dude. We're going until I feel like I've had enough.\" She began scooting back down to my waist, almost immediately beginning to tug my sleeper pants to unleash my rock-hard pipe.\n\n\"Wh- wait, Reeda! I don't have any condoms!\"\n\nShe cackled and yanked them all the way down, tossing my pants off to the side as she mounted me, then underbelly of my dick meeting her soaked nether region as she seated herself. \"Anon, I doubt a skinnie could knock up someone other than another skinny. It'll be fine. Now let me see if what they say about skinnies is true.\" She remarked, rolling her hips to put down a thick layer of her natural lubricant on me, the tingling warmth enveloping me.\n\n\"Wh-what do they say?\" I questioned, trying my best not to moan as she teased me.\n\n\"You're warm-blooded, right? I heard your cum is like, super warm. I wanna know if it's true.\" She focused her weight on my crown, my hands gripping her thighs as I strained to keep quiet.\n\nOnly a couple moments later, after more torturous teasing, Reeda raised herself and seized the base of my dick, aiming it straight at her primed mound and began to seat herself, both of our faces contorting into expressions of bliss. That was it: I was no longer a virgin. But if she were to just suddenly hop off and say \"meh, don't feel like it anymore\" no one could really count that. The moment of truth came when she lifted herself once more. I swear, it was almost like it was about to slip out. But instead, she SLAMMED herself right back down on me, a loud \"CLAP\" sounding out from the meaty smack as she began her second ride.\n\n\"Fuck, d-dude. You're so warm... I love it...\"\n\nA nice thing to hear right before being broken by a horny dino in the middle of her estrus. The pace was quickly picking up, her hands finding their place on my damp chest as she began scratching my chest gently, which I was sure wasn't going to last very long, seeing as how she was quickly working herself up. It almost seemed like when she got relief, it just served to guide her into an eventual frenzy.\n\nThese sensations I felt were completely alien to me. The way her velvety walls gripped and stroked me was unlike anything my own hand could do. Hell, her own hand felt way better than anything I could do. On top of that, there was the enveloping warmth that kept me riled up and desperate for more. Then there was the unrestrained view of her face, the way her eyes closed and her head tilted up as she let out various grunts, groans, and moans as she worked. Our bodies went through the motions, hers bouncing and riding, mine recoiling and flexing under her as she more or less had her way with me. I could even make out the bouncing of her ample chest under her flapping shirt, along with the occasional peek at her nipple piercings as they teased him with their shimmers and glints. At least I wouldn't have to be too embarrassed if I just let her do all the work, as she seemed more than capable of getting herself off with my equipment.\n\nTrue to my prediction, it only took a couple of minutes before Reeda was acting just like the sex-crazed demon as before. Her nails were regularly raking against my chest as she slammed herself down with more and more sexual fury, red marks soon becoming visible with each passing swipe, becoming dangerously close to drawing blood. At that point, I was starting to groan in a mixture of pain and pleasure; a controversial, yet wonderful combination. The claps of our bodies grew louder, coming about with such an intensity, I was almost sure our neighbors could hear us. And my poor bed. The box-spring mattress was screaming and the wooden frame was creaking, surely beginning to knock some pegs or nails loose. I could've even sworn at some point I could feel my legs being dislocated from the sheer ferocity of the raptor.\n\nBut to my horror, I could feel that familiar sensation rearing it's ugly head. I was about to cum my fucking brains out right into some quality, raptor pussy. Fuck, not yet. Please! But no amount of pleading could change the inevitable. The only thing I could utter was just an obnoxiously loud grunt as I tried my best to mute myself by biting my tongue, as a torrent of cum began to paint her inner walls in alabaster goodness. The very first jet to hit her earned a pleased growl as she settled down, seating herself fully as her thighs squeezed my waist. As I emptied my payload with the last rounds, her eyes began to crack open, her gaze falling upon me like I was a piece of meat for her enjoyment as she leaned down to place a trail of kisses up my throat and off my lips, some of her own juices collecting itself on her lips. She licked her chops, sampling her own taste before she gave a throaty chuckle, placing her hands on the mattress on either side of my head.\n\n\"So it's true... It really is nice and hot. I want MORE.\"\n\nI shrank into the mattress, suddenly becoming terrified of the monster I helped to create. She suddenly and violently took me in for a dominating kiss, cramming her tongue into my mouth and nearly causing me to choke on it. I could even hear those beastial- no, demonic growls as she savagely battered my tongue and tonsils with her own muscle, slithering it out of my mouth when she broke the kiss, nipping and tugging my bottom lip as she righted herself on my pelvis. My erotic horror was peaked when her long tail crept up to tickle my throat, only to then coil around it a couple times like some kind of fur-covered snake, where it gently began to constrict, closing off my windpipe ever so slightly.\n\n\"You're not leaving until I'm done with you, Anon. I hope you took ibuprofen earlier.\"\n\n\"I-... Didn't.\" I muttered, choked up slightly by her tail around my throat.\n\nReeda started to lift herself. \"Shame.\"\n\nRound 3 started off strong. Brutally strong. It was even more brutal than towards the end of round 2. I was sure this night was going to be the end of my bed, as the squeaks only grew louder. I could even feel myself sinking into the mattress so far I ended up hitting the board underneath, which really only just went to show how wild she was going. Mixed in with the furious bounces of her body, was periods of something more gentle, where she would take me down to the hilt and begin to gyrate her hips in an effort to milk every drop she could out of me, along with the clenches of those walls around me, showing she had some strong fucking kegels. The way she looked down at me only showed she knew what she was doing to me, like she was telepathically telling me \"this is what you can look forward to\". And once that time was up, she went back to brutally riding me, the soreness of my pelvis becoming more and more prevalent as she treated me like her own personal toy, not even caring if I need to be put into a cast after this.\n\nThe raptor's fury never stopped. At one point, as she clawed at my chest more, carving me up like a ham, my tank top was left in shreds, my chest now beginning to bleed as she did. With the next round of gyrations, her tail began to coil tighter, my windpipe closing, and my face surely turning brighter red as time went on. When she was finished clawing my chest, she began to lean forward once more, this time one of her hands catching itself on my face, her nails hooking into my cheek while the other fell onto my pillow, which was sure to not last long given what she did to my chest. And I was fearing the worst for my face as well. Thankfully, it would come out relatively intact.\n\nThe slamming only ramped up and my eyes started to water as I had to endure the fury of the raptor as she took me, her ass slamming so hard onto my waist that I was beginning to worry I would come out with a pelvis that was turned to dust from it all. Even my dick was starting to hurt. The constant friction, even with the natural lubricant she produced that mixed with my previous load, was starting to make it feel sore like a well worn muscle. Not bad considering I just lost my virginity only a couple minutes ago. And hell, I was even lasting longer than before despite what was happening to me.\n\nThen, her tail constricted further. Now, I once again couldn't breath. Any cries of pleasure or pain came out as choked up rasps and breaths, my face feeling hot and my vision beginning to blur as I watched Reeda continue to abuse me so fervently, like the plaything I was to her. I couldn't handle it. I could practically feel not only my body, but my mind breaking from under her, like it was what she wanted all along. Like she was molding me into the perfect person to please her. My head was growing light, and my vision was turning into distant pinpricks, yet I could still feel everything with the utmost detail. The warmth of her, the constant eddies of bliss and surges of pain, it was all so vivid and surreal. I must have been dreaming this entire time. Surely, I would find out soon enough.\n\nAnd with luck on my side, I would. I could feel that sensation once more. Like on the Ferris wheel and during round two. I was about to dump another load into her just like she wanted. My eyes managed to shoot open and my body writhed under her, the look on Reeda's face turning into a devilish grin as she knew what was to come. With a final squeeze of her tail around my throat, she leaned back on her hands, showing off those gyrations with an unhindered view of her stirring my rod around inside her, a distinct bump in her flesh forming that contrasted with her normally flat abdomen.\n\n\"C'mon, Anon. I know you have it in you. Give me what I want. Give it ALL to me.\"\n\nHer voice somehow sounded even more lurid as she continued the gyrations, still trying to milk me for all I was worth. However much I was worth I didn't and probably couldn't know. All I knew was I had something she wanted, which I gave to her in abundance. The final climax was powerful enough, that I felt my body seize and my teeth grit as I continued to choke loudly and desperately, finally reaching the most powerful climax to date. And with Reeda's approving moan, she settled herself down, resorting to simply massaging my rod with her inner walls, letting herself be filled to the brim, to the point there was the beginnings of some spillage seeping out from between us. Finally, her tail loosened so I could breathe, but remained loosely wrapped around my neck like a feather boa.\n\n\"Fuuuuck, Anon. You were just what I needed. No homo, right?\" She asked, calming herself down to something a bit less terrifying as she remained seated on my dick.\n\n\"N-no homo.\" I replied hoarsely.\n\n\"Alright, I think I got another dozen in me left. Ready, Anon?\" She asked, beginning to lightly bounce herself on my waist once again.\n\nSweet Raptor Jesus, this is gonna be a long night.\n\n...\n\nI don't think I had ever been used like that before. Come to think of it, I never was. The night was filled with far more than I could have ever hoped for, and filled with positions I didn't even know actually existed. I could remember it all so vividly like I was watching a recording. I even distinctly remember getting folded in half at some point. After waking up, I heard the sound of retching in the bathroom, which, considering I was in my bed by myself, I could only assume was Reeda.\n\nProbably nothing...","Title":"Bro Job","Characters":"Reeda and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"PogBot 9000","Summary":"Anon is trying to get over his break up while hanging out with Reeda who offers him a listening ear.

Everyone had had a good time, and the spectacle had been enough to keep him distracted from his worries for a few hours. But as he now made his way home through the moonlit streets, the noise of the the other students wishing each other the best for the future and making promises to stay in touch fading into the distance, these worries returned with a vengeance.\nIt was a pretty safe bet that the band was over and done, Reed thought. That was of course Trish's fault. If not for her attempts to break up Fang and Anon, they might have still been a team.\nPart of him knew that he was oversimplifying things. Hell, it's not like he couldn't have helped to prevent the whole mess. If he hadn't been so goddamned complacent then-\nWell, no sense crying over spilt milk.\nReed stopped beneath a street light and lit one up. Inhaled deeply and looked up at the moon.\nHe guessed that after the events of the evening, a comeback was out of the question for good. He, like everyone else, had heard Fang play. She had been good. Not on the level of a professional singer, of course; she lacked the post production and the connections of a Rhinorex producer for that, but it had still been better than a school performer had any right to be. Better than any high schoo in bumfuck nowhere deserved.\nShe didn't need her bandmates anymore.\n\nAnd perhaps that would be for the best. Looking back, Reed had to admit that the band had been run less than optimal. Just why had he felt the need to always go along with Trish?\nTo protect Fang.\nFrom herself.\nBut now it seemed as if she had found someone who could do this far better than Reed had ever been able to.\nAnd he was happy for her. For Anon, too. He could tell how much they loved each other whenever he saw the two of them together. He held no doubt in his mind that the two of them would overcome whatever life sent their way.\nBut without the band, what would he do?\nHe had never quite moved on from the plans they'd made before Anon came to Volcano High. Finish school, then buy some old van and drive coast to coast, playing wherever people would let them. Build a fanbase. Get discovered.\nHe'd never managed to let this fantasy go.\nNow that it was dead and buried, he would have to find something else to do.\nProbably deal a little more, until Fang's dad finally caught up to him. Who knew, perhaps he never would. Reed would just sell off what remained of his stash and then-\nThen what?\nCompete with some snot-nosed school kids for some entry level job stocking aisles in some super market?\nBeg for an apprenticeship at his aunt's funeral parlor?\n\"I fucked it up,\" Reed mumbled to himself as he threw the stump of his cigarette onto the sidewalk. \"Fucked it all up,\" he added as he squashed it beneath his heel. The sight of his family home looming in front of him had never inspired this much melancholia in him before.\nHe opened the door as silently as possible. Running into his parents was the last thing he wanted to cap off his evening. The dark hallway on the other side was a welcome sight. He'd just slide in, sneak up the stairs and fall into his bed befo-\n\"Hey, Reed, is that you?\" called a familiar voice. From the living room, over the top of the couch's backrest, illuminated by the faint, blue-ish glow of the TV-screen, a familiar face was watching him.\n\"Rea?\"\n\"Who did you expect, li'l bro?\"\nAs she got up to give her brother a welcome hug, Reed realized how much he had missed her. Her lazy smile, that familiar top she always seemed to wear when she was around, the smoky smell of her ruffled mane as his snout sunk into her featherhair, it all came together to create a sense of relieved familiarity.\n\"I missed you,\" he almost whispered into her mane and at last she loosened her hug to get a good look at him.\n\"And I missed you, bro.\"\n\"I thought you'd be on tour,\" he said and Rea laughed that easy laugh that had always cheered him up.\n\"You know, until yesterday I thought so too. But you know how it is, things happen, and then they never seem to work out. But who am I to tell you, you get plenty of that yourself with your band, don't you?\"\nThen, when he doesn't answer immediately: \"But hey, speaking of the band, how are you doing? Was prom all it's cracked up to be?\"\n\"It was OK,\" he finally managed, still overwhelmed by the onslaught of emotions that raged through his head.\n\"I bet you guys knocked 'em dead!\" Rea throws up horns \"Yeah, VVURM DRAMA! Woo!\"\n\"We didn't play, actually.\" \nRea lets her shoulders slack and tilts her head slightly as she processes this new information.\n\"You didn't? I thought that was what you've been working towards for the last year.\"\n\"Yeah, but things happened. Didn't work out.\" He didn't want to talk about this now. All he wanted was to go up to his room and empty a thermos of carfe to forget about the last few weeks. He didn't even realize that he was basically echoing his sister back at her.\nBut Rea did. The concerned look his sister gave him reminded him of their mother. Guessing his plan for the evening, she gently laid his tail around his hips.\n\"Hey, Reed. Wanna sit with me for a while? Just to catch up?\" She gave him an open smile. \"You don't have to talk about anything you don't want to. But if you want, I am here for you, bro.\"\nDespite himself, Reed allowed her to nudge him towards the couch. He knew exactly what Rea meant when she said that he didn't HAVE to tell her. She wouldn't pry, but do her best to steer the conversation into a direction that would allow her to figure out the core of things. And while he'd rather forget about the band and his fucked up future, he knew deep down that talking to someone could only help.\nHell, Fang and Anon had demonstrated as much.\nAnd if there was anyone he could open up to, it was Rea.\n\"The band won't play anymore,\" he told her as he flopped down onto the couch. Some talking head on TV was saying something about increased gang violence on skin row, but Rea turned off the sound with a flick of her claw. The look she gave him was incredolous.\n\"It's over. Done. We won't ever stand on stage together again, Rea.\" He didn't know this, and yet he felt that it was true. Some part deep within him had known ever since the slides of Anon had popped up in Naomi's presentation.\nHis sister sat down next to him. He saw her looking at him in the corner of his eye as he kept staring at the Dino on the TV. Rea put her hand on his arm, but didn't push him to go on. He was thankful for that. When he finally found the strength to go on, he could feel the tears forming in the corners of his eyes.\n\"So Lu- Fang got a boyfriend. Anon, a skinny. But a great dude. He's my bro too, you know.\" He smiled despite himself. \"But Trish, she- she thought he'd drive a wedge between her and Fang. So she tried to break them up. Funny thing is, she only really managed to ruin her own friendship with Fang.\"\nHe was crying now. When was the last time he had cried? Must've been when those skinnies jumped him to get his supply and that one guy hit him with a mean kidney hook. That had hurt. But now, the hurt was a different one.\n\"So, yeah. The band is finished. Fang played alone tonight, and she was better than ever before. There's no way she's coming back now. Can't even fault her. Maybe she can do her own thing with Anon or something. But VVURM DRAMA is dead in the water.\"\nHe had dreaded saying out loud what he had felt for so long now, as if giving his thoughts voice would only serve to make them come true. But now that he'd done so, he couldn't deny that he felted as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders.\nHis sister slung her arms around his neck and pulled him in close again, resting her chin on his head.\n\"Man, Reed, I am sorry to hear this.\" For a while, they just sat there in contemplative silence, enjoying the closeness of one another and the rythm of the other's heartbeat.\nThen, after a while, Rea said: \"It's kind of funny, I always thought if any dude would end up with Lucy, it would be you.\"\nReed scoffed at that, inadvertantly blowing his nose into his sister's ratty top. If Rea noticed, she took it in stride.\n\"You sound like mom.\"\n\"Well, duh. I am you older sister. I am supposed to worry about my brother.\"\n\"You're just a year older than me, dude. People think we're twins.\"\n\"Yeah, but still...\"\nThe sentence peetered out without ever being finished, but neither of them cared all that much.\n\"Rea?\" Reed finally said.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"You need to let me go.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I need  to get a tissue or I'll get snot all over your top.\"\nA playful shove, and Reed found that he was free again. But before he could get up, he heard a \"Think fast!\" and just managed to turn his head a few degrees before a pack of tissues connected with his face.\n\"Ouch,\" he said without really meaning it and started fiddling with the opening.\nNext to him, his sister groaned. \"Didn't you say you needed the tissue to prevent this, bro?\"\nRea held the hem of her top and stretched it downwards to get a good look at its front. Even in the pale light of the TV there was a wet and slimy patch visible where her brother's face had rested.\n\"I'm sorry,\" he managed between two blows of the nose, \"Should've said something sooner.\"\n\"Nah, it's fine.\"\nRea leaned  back again and examined him with an unreadable gaze. \"Man, that really sucks,\" she said. \"I know how much the band meant to you.\"\nHe nodded and tried to throw the thouroughly soaked tissue onto the TV stand. He missed, and it flopped against the side of the stand before dropping to the floor. The politician on the news looked as if he were judging him.\n\"Don't do that,\" Rea said in a voice utterly bereft of conviction. In fact, she was smiling a little.\n\"Why not? If mom and dad were here, they'd've come down here already. Way I see is, there's no one here to complain.\"\n\"I am here,\" she said. Her long downy tail slung itself around his shoulders and pulled him close again. \"Sooo..\" She was unsure whether she should ask. Reed didn't seem like he was high, and in a way, that made him more unpredictable than usual. Still, he hadn't stormed out on her yet.\n\"...what are you going to do now that you've graduated?\"\nShe felt the breath catch in Reed's throat and for a second she thought that she had ruined the evening, but then he breathed out again and leaned into her some more, his head leaning almost onto her shoulder.\"\n\"I don't know,\" he admitted. \"We had planned a tour, you know? Get some banged up van like yours and just drive across the country. Bit like a gap year, but also building up something of a portfolio. 'Played there and there then and then', you know?\"\nHis hands clenched. \"That's gone out of the window now.\"\nRea didn't know what to say to that. \"I am sorry,\" she tried, painfully aware of just how generic it sounded. Her hands found his and gently pried open the almost cramped fingers to entwine them with her own. His head rested completely on her shoulders now. She didn't know when the last time they were together like this was. Probably in their early teens.\nNot like their relationship had soured or anything, but after a certain age it had become awkward to be overly physical with each other. This awkwardness was gone now. It felt good to just sit there and hold on to one another. Their embrace said more than a thousand words. Rea felt that it could perhaps almost make up for her lacklustre attempt to comfort him verbally.\n\"Hey, Reed,\" she tried again. \"We'll figure something out, alright? Starting tomorrow, we'll set things straight.\"\nShe didn't think that she sounded particularily convincing, but she could feel his brother nod against her shoulder.\n\"I'd like, that, sis,\" he mumbled, \"Id like that alot.\"\n\nRea woke up early the next morning as the first faint rays of light shone through the blinds of the living room window and straight into her eyes.\nShe groaned and cracked a neck stiff from a night spent on the couch. Splayed out over the other end of said couch lay Reed, his legs draped over her own. Her brother was still fast asleep and for a moment she entertained the idea that perhaps she could close the blinds just a little bit tighter, curl up in the area Reed's legs left her, and go back to sleep herself.\nNah.\nShe knew how her body worked. If she went back to sleep now, even just that kind of half-slumber that tended to catch her in similar situations, she'd be nothing but tired and cranky later in the day.\nRea didn't like being tired and cranky.\nAnd a grumpy sister was the last thing Reed needed right now.\nSo she carefully sat up, gathered her brother's legs in her hands and lifted them just the slightest bit to slide off the couch, before carefully setting them down again. Reed fidgeted a little, but gave otherwise no indication of having had his sleep disturbed. Looking down at her brother, Rea shook her head. Poor Reed. The debacle with his band really must have hit him hard.\nNow that she thought about it, she couldn't recall Reed ever saying anything concrete about his plans for the future. Sure, she had asked him from time to time when she had still lived at home and so had their parents, but they'd never been able to get much more out of him than his aspirations to become a professional drummer. \nAnd that had been enough for them. Reed already was in a band, the rest would work out as well. Looking back, it seemed as if the whole household had agreed that things would go smoothly. Rea had managed to turn her interest in mountain biking into a career, travelling from extreme sports expo to sports show across the country, and it seemed they'd all decided that her brother would succeed at turning his hobby into his job as well. These things always worked out in the end.\nUntil they didn't.\nAs she looked at him, she felt a sense of guilt sneak up on her. Was she to blame for his lack of a plan B, at least partially? She figured that at the very least she probably hadn't set the most realistic example when it came to building a long-term career.\nBut at least she'd come home at exactly the right time to set things straight. She'd do whatever she could to set her brother up with something resembling a future. That was the least she could do.\nBut first she'd take a shower. You couldn't face the future smelling like cold smoke and stale sweat.\nShe looked down at herself and pulled a face as she was reminded of a certain stain's existence. \nAdd 'caked in your brother's snot' to the list, she thought. \n\nWhen Reed awoke, it wasn't because of the rays of light that had roused his sister from her sleep, but rather the unmistakable smell of breakfast that wafted into the living room.\nIt took a moment for his still sluggish mind to remember just why he had come to on the couch, but even as he sat up the memories started to come back to him.\nMan, he would have to apologize to Rea for just unloading all his baggage onto her.\nGroggily he made his way over to the kitchen area. Wincing as the sun shone through the window opposite the door and straight into his eyes he made out just what going on in there.\nThe kitchen table was filled with a wide assortment of foodstuffs. Reed was pretty sure that if it had been in the fridge, it was on there now. Slices of bread, different topucs, bowls of cereals and sliced fruit, cups that steamed with piping hot coffee; it was all there. Rea was busy at the work station, humming along to the radio as she flipped something in a pan that sent steamy strings of succulent scent wafting through the room. She had swapped her ratty top for one of his shirts snd her hair was still wet from what must've been a morning shower.\n\"Hey, Reed! Finally awake, I see.\" she greeted him. \"And with perfect timing, too. I am just about finished with the french toast.\"\nWith a flick of the wrist she sent the contents of the pan onto a plate before tossing the now empty pan into the sink where it sizzled in the water.\nA little stunned by the display of gluttony, Reed slumped into one of the chairs. His sister sat down opposite of him and placed the plate of french toast between the two of them.\n\"What's up, dude? Not hungry?\" Rea was already busy filling up her plate with a wide selection of the foodstuffs on offer while her brother was still taking in the selection.\n\"I haven't really eaten all that much breakfast lately,\" he said somewhat lamely, then snorted. \"Jeez, Rea. I thought you were an athlete. Don't you have to, like keep in shape?\"\nHe just managed to dodge a piece of thrown silverware.\n\"I'll have you know that it takes more than just sport to maintain these guns, bro.\" She flexed her biceps at him. \"And calories aside, when you come home from some shitty event where all you had was some rank-ass catering, and see a fridge like you guys have here, chances are you just can't help yourself.\"\nReed seemed to deflate a little in his chair, his expression growing dim.\n\"Yeah, that must be pretty nice,\" he admitted.\nAw shit, here you go, you stupid bitch, Rea mentally berated herself. Way to lay a finger into Reed's wounds.\n\"I'm sorry, Reed,\" she said out loud, \"I wasn't thinking just now. I didn't mean to-\"\n\"It's alright,\" he cut her off. \"No, seriously. Please don't do that whole walking on eggshells thing around me, ok? I- I am glad that you are around. And I don't want what's going on between my friends to drag you down as well. Right now I just want to get over the band, but that won't work out when you steer clear of things. Like, if things between us aren't like they usually are, then that'll just remind me of that whole mess. Does that make sense? At all?\"\nHe sounded as if he were genuinenly unsure.\n\"Uh, yeah. But- okay, listen, Reed. I am sorry if I've hurt you. It's just that I am trying to find kind of a balance here. But hey, alright. No more false consideration. Just shooting the shit for however long I am staying. How's that sound, bro?\"\n\"Sounds sweet.\"\nRea smiled as her brother finally started digging into the breakfast, but inwardly her thoughts were racing. Seemed like if she wanted to help her brother get his life (back?) on track, she would have to be more subtle about it than she had thought.\n","Title":"Bro Problem","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Reed and Reeda","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Brojob.txt":{"path":["Reed And Reeda","Brojob.txt"],"text":"Title: Brojob\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Reed and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: Short\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n> driving with Reed accidentally grab his leg instead of gearstick\n> we both laugh and I unzip his pants\n> park the car while fondling his balls\n> Reed is laughing because he knows it's just a joke\n> Start sucking his dick on this empty parking lot > Almost choke on his dick because i'm laughing so hard\n> Reed is also laughing his ass off he starts making train noises while yelling \"BROJOB BROJOB!

Like, all the time.\"\n\nOh yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nI get up from the awkward position that I landed in, propping myself up against the side of my bed next to Reed once again.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Yea, I do that sometimes... I'm told.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Told by who, Fang?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Yeah, her. I mean they. Them. Fang.\"\n\nWhatever.\n\nThe name puts a bitter taste in my mouth. I reach for my bottle that is miraculously only half-spilled, and down the rest.\n\nAfterward, I toss the empty bottle away.\n\n[Reed]\n\"What was that? Something up with Fang?\"\n\nShe offers me the joint that I gladly accept, taking a long drag.\n\nI'm not sure what Reed put in this shit, but the substance works its magic quick as fuck.\n\nCertainly more than weed.\n\n[Anon]\n\"We uh... We broke up.\"\n\nI pass it back to her, and brace myself for the post confession interrogation that is sure to follow.\n\nBut it doesn't.\n\n[Reed]\n\"I'm sorry man.\"\n\nShe takes a drag herself.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Like, when though?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I dunno, like, a few weeks ago?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Seriously? Nobody said anything to me about it.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Like, why wouldn't you tell me?\"\n\nShe's getting uncomfortably serious. I steal the smoke from her and don't let go till she takes it back.\n\n[Reed]\n\"whatdafackman\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"It couldn't have been that bad.\"\n\nWhat is there to say.\n\nI look up at the ceiling, letting the heavenly numbness spread through my body.\n\nGuess Reed took it as a good enough answer, cause the next thing I feel is her slender arm wrap around my shoulders.\n\n[Reed]\n\"It's like, whatever man... You gonna be okay tho?\"\n\nI nod slightly but don't answer.\n\nShe goes silent after that for a bit. Her arm feels nice and warm.\n\nThe next time she speaks, there is a weird edge to her voice. Like she's trying to feign indifference or something.\n\n[Reed]\n\"So you're uh, totally splitsville?\"\n\nI can feel her arm tensing up a bit as she waits for my answer.\n\n[Anon]\n\"I guess.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Haha so like, now we can totes be bachelors in Europoo and shit...\"\n\nwut\n\n[Anon]\n\"What about Trish?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"...I guess we can invite her too?\"\n\nHer surprise just confuses me even more. I turn to face her all serious like.\n\n[Anon]\n\"That's not what... I mean, isn't she like, your girlfriend or something?\"\n\nShe gives me a weird look, eyes narrowing as she takes a drag from a new joint.\n\nI didn't even notice her lighting that shit up, fucking ninja.\n\nIn the end, she laughs in my face.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Hahaha, oh my gawd, you legit thought we were like, dating?\"\n\nUh...\n\nUhhhhhhh.....\n\n[Anon]\n\"No?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Hahahahaha\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Fuck me hahrhahhrahrha\"\n\nHer giggles turn dino snorting-ish, tears rolling down her face.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Oh my dude, you are seriously a weirdo retardo.\"\n\nShe gives me the joint, and wipes the tears from her redded cheeks. Getting a bit more serious as she straightens up.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Nah, we ain't dating dawg.\"\n\nOh.\n\nFuuuuck.\n\nMeeee.\n\nTHERE IS A SINGLE FEMALE IN MY ROOM\n\nDEFCON MAXIMUM LEVEL\n\nSKYKING SKYKING SKYKING\n\nHOW MANY SKYKINGS IS TOP LEVEL\n\n[Anon]\n\"Haha, but can you eat all the eggs?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"What?\"\n\nI try to retreat the fucking flood of spaghetti back into my pocket before I go all up bucatini.\n\nDO.\n\nNOT. \n\nSAY.\n\nI can eat you out or w\/e.\n\n...\n\nIn the end, I say nothing.\n\nSuccessfully navigating the smoke in my shaking hand to my mouth I let the miracle of drug abuse wash my awkwardness away.\n\nHopefully.\n\nMeanwhile, Reed positions herself closer to me, and I can feel her warm scales push up against my arm.\n\nNow I also have a way too fucking good look all over the insides of her loose tank top.\n\n[Reed]\n\"So like, maybe I could be your girlfriend for tonight, Anon?\"\n\nI almost choke on the fumes.\n\nDid this bitch just quote globohomo memes?\n\nWait, but more to the point...\n\n[Anon]\n\"uhhh\"\n\nOutstanding performance!\n\nI decide to shut my fucking face instead, and look down at her.\n\nReed is pressing her back against my arm and chest, playing with one of the locks of her long hair.\n\nOr mane. Idk.\n\nHer at all times seductive eyes are giving a very distinct fuck me look.\n\nOh boy.\n\nI have no idea what to fuck to say or do, but luckily Reed is not taking a retard for an answer. \n\nShe wraps one of my hands into her surprisingly big dino-sized palm, and places it on her bra under the baggy tank top.\n\n[Reed]\n\"What do you say, big boy?\"\n\nWith the powers of dino tiddy I drown the urge to say \"For you\".\n\nI gently, awkwardly cup her breast, feel it up through her bra. She bites her lip, humming softly in response.\n\nWow this is like... Hot as fuck.\n\nI shift a bit so I can utilize both hands, earning another giggle.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Mhm, you likey? Did Fang ever let you?\"\n\nMy arms stiffen, and Reed herself quickly recognizes that she fucked up by mentioning h- them again.\n\nFuck me, is this how it's always gonna be now? It's been weeks.\n\nGet over it already you fuckwad!\n\nI clear my throat and resume pumping her breasts. She's surprised, but visibly pleased.\n\n[Anon]\n\"No we um, we figured out kissing. Kinda.\"\n\nWith a giggle Reed turns to face me, getting up on all fours. I can't not notice that her bra is almost falling off of her, revealing her bare breasts.\n\n[Reed]\n\"So you've never actually been with a girl before?\"\n\nShe winks teasingly, and takes one last puff from - wait when the fuck did she take that from me?\n\nAnyway, she flicks the butt away and crawls into my lap, sitting up into a cowgirl position.\n\nMy hands instinctively move to her waist, hoisting her up properly.\n\nI'm sure that about now my face would just be red as her scales, if only my blood wasn't busy building a tent in my pants.\n\nLike, a five fucking dimensional tent fuck me Reed you are killing me.\n\n[Anon]\n\"S-So, have uhm, have yoouuu beenwithanyonebefore?\"\n\nShe giggles again, running a hand through her mane, the other slowly but surely making its way down on my chest and stomach.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Maybe I have.\"\n\nShe leans in closer, her voice turning into a whisper.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Or, maybe I haven't?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Are you going to take my virginity, Anon?\"\n\nBy the end her snout is right beside my ear, her hot breath covering my everything.\n\nAt the same time, she finally reaches my belt buckle, and runs a few of her fingers along my skin under it.\n\nOhhhfuuuckmmeeReeeed...\n\nThe only response I can muster is grabbing her meaty parts harder, pulling her body close.\n\nI run my hands over her ass, and... Wait. Wait what the- Oh is? Oh my god is that her tail?\n\nReed fuck you your tail is awesome.\n\nI start laughing like a retard, playing with her ass and tail.\n\nShe's guffawed but joins in after a few seconds.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Dude, are you like... Hey, you can play with it later okay?\"\n\nShe straightens up and takes my toy away, like a mom scolding her child.\n\nNot a beat later off comes her top. Oh. Oh my.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Fucking weirdo man...\"\n\nShe murmurs, closing in the gap between us again, making a point of placing my hands over her bra.\n\nThere's no anger in her voice though.\n\nShe returns her attention to my belt, undoing it with clear expertise.\n\nVirginity my ass. Or maybe she gave a lot of handjobs.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Reed, did you give a lot of handjobs?\"\n\n...\n\nI can practically feel her inner struggle.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Anon, are you... Asking me to give you a handjob?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Y-yes?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Umm...\"\n\nShe tries to get back into the flow, playing around with my boxer and having her long fingers slightly brush up against my dick.\n\nIt doesn't seem to work though.\n\nShe gets up with a frustrated \"UGH\", obviously upset.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Geez, sorry Anon, I just... Ugh!\"\n\nI open my mouth, however she quickly intercepts me before I could ruin the mood even more.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Just give me a minute you dork, aight?\"\n\nShe corrects her bra while fishing yet another joint from her wallet, lighting it up in mere seconds.\n\nI follow suit and get myself a beer, opening it on the metal frame of the bed. Reed blows a few smoke rings, following my movement from the corner of her eye.\n\nLooks like she wants to say something too, but instead she just takes one last deep drag and returns to my lap.\n\nShe offers the roll to me, but this time I refuse. She shrugs and takes my face into one of her hands, a lot more slow and lovey-dovey than the lusting haste from before.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Then c'mere you ass.\"\n\nWe settle into a gentle kiss that is only a little awkward. I definitely have that butterflies-in-the-stomach feel, yet I can't shake the weirdness of it. Fang was the only one that I kissed before.\n\nIt doesn't feel wrong. Just, weird.\n\nOnce again, Reed's hand tracks its way down to my half chub, and I start groping her ass.\n\nNo tailplay this time. Heh.\n\nThe room quickly regains its frisky atmosphere as we get more and more into it. Soon Reed is riding me in rhythm with her strokes, and I'm trying to get her bra undone.\n\nI want to interject and pull my boxers down too, but I don't want to risk another disaster. This feels great anyway.\n\nToo great, actually.\n\nOH\n\nNO\n\nI break away from the passionate kiss.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Reed, I, I'm gonna-\"\n\nI see an evil grin make its way onto her face before I'm caught up in another kiss, Reed practically doubling her efforts to get me to soil my pants.\n\nI try to hold on, but it's a losing battle. She rides out the climax with me to its very end, gradually slowing down.\n\nAfterward she backs off, giving me a sly look.\n\n[Reed]\n\"So how was that?\"\n\nI'm too caught up in the moment to respond, so I just watch her lick the mess off of her fingers.\n\nWith a what the fuck how long is that tongue.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Wa' I uh goo' gi'lf'en'?\"\n\nShe gives me one last peck on the lips once she's done, and crawls out of my lap.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Go clean yourself up, dude!\"\n\nYea, naaaah.\n\nI'm practically still drooling on the spot.\n\nYeah, I uh, I'm just. Imma sleep k?\n\n* * *\n\nI awake to the bed shifting next to me.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Whuh?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Chill, I just gotta go work.\"\n\nOh godddddd, my head is killing me. Also someone switched my tongue for sandpaper.\n\n[Anon]\n\"But it's saturday?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\n\nI open one eye with caution, taking in my surroundings.\n\nReed's already changed into another top that is a rather bland shirt, and is now buttoning up a new set of jeans.\n\nA quick scan of the clock tells me that it's not even 10 am.\n\nI grudgingly turn in bed so at least I face her general direction.\n\nIn the next few minutes she grabs her wallet and whatnot from various parts of the room, then returns to the side of the bed.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Hey so, I work till six. I have some shit to do after that, but I can come back and crash the weekend...?\"\n\nIt takes me a few seconds to process what she just said. Is she blushing?\n\nAm I blushing?\n\n[Anon]\n\"Y-yeah, I'd like that.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Aight then, see you soon babe!\"\n\nShe gives me a peck on the cheek, then hastily makes her way for the door. I'm too overwhelmed to respond.\n\nWhat the fuck just happened.\n\nNot only did Reed just kiss me, but she called me babe.\n\nAnd why am I not more alarmed by this?\n\nGeez, what the fuck happened here last night? Even attempting to remember puts my hangover brain into overdrive.\n\nMidst my suffering I reach for my balls that are itching up a storm, only to be greeted by a crusty-sticky layer of-\n\nThen it all comes back to me.\n\nFuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.\n\nOh god, we totally did it, right?\n\nNo wait, it was like... We had clothes on and stuff.\n\nJesus R. Christ.\n\nWhat was I thinking? What will the others think?\n\nWhat will Fang think?\n\n...\n\nWait, why do I even care what Fang thinks?\n\nDamn my head...\n\nI stay in bed for a long time. Both to pull myself together and to assess the situation.\n\nAre we dating now? She called me babe.\n\nBut it was just like, a quicky or something. Maybe it was out of pity cause I told her about Fang?\n\nOr are we fuck buddies? Friends with benefits?\n\nFUCK\n\nShe wants to stay the weekend? What the fuck is the time?\n\nI look at the alarm, way too fast for my sluggish eyes to focus.\n\n...\n\nJust past noon.\n\nWell, this is a good enough excuse to find some food I guess.\n\nIt only takes me ten minutes to crawl out of bed and make my way to the kitchen, wading through a labyrinth of empty bottles and opened bags of munchies. And clothes.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon is spent painfully tidying the place up, and stressing over the whole Reed situation.\n\nI think about messaging her multiple times, but I don't want to bother her during work. Not that I have any idea what to say to her.\n\nLater on I decide that if we're a thing now, I'm gonna be responsible about it and buy some condoms. It can't hurt to have 'em, right?\n\nSome decent food maybe, enough for two.\n\nI leave the flat a little before five. That should give me enough time to do a roundtrip before Reed finishes with her stuff.\n\nThere should be a convenience store to the north, just outside Skin Row. One of the cheap ones.\n\nThe journey there is uneventful, and so is picking out my items. Meals for two, and an XL pack of magnum dongs.\n\nMight as well.\n\nReally I spend most of the time examining my shoes, avoiding eye contact with anyone. Please god let the cashier not be the talkative type, this is embarrassing enough as it is.\n\n[????]\n\"Um, hey Anon!\"\n\nWait, what?\n\nI look up, and Reed's staring me right in the face.\n\nOh no. OHNNNOOOOOO\n\nA student working weekends?\n\nLike, a typical cashier job at a cheap local chain?\n\nClose enough so she can sleep in?\n\nWhy didn't I connect the dots?\n\nShe starts scanning my items nonchalantly, till she gets to the... The fucking. Till she gets to them.\n\nI seriously contemplate running as she holds the pack up in the air in a very accusatory manner.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Dude.\"\n\nBe still my beating heart.\n\n[Reed]\n\"You can't get me prego, dumbass.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Uh, I knew that.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Yeah sure, so this is for all your other gee effs then?\"\n\nShe sets the pack aside and returns to scanning the rest. The only other item to pique her interest is some frozen lasagna.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Oooh, me likey!\"\n\n...\n\n[Reed]\n\"Aight, that'll be 23.50, stud.\"\n\nI know that she's being sarcastic but I blush nonetheless.\n\nI hand her the money and grab my stuff. There's no line behind me, so I try to be social and stay for a chat.\n\n[Anon]\n\"So um, sup?\"\n\nShe just shrugs.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Eh, regular slow day.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"But hey, imma be off in like, twenty minutes tops.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"I know I've said that I have some stuff to do, but you could come along?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Sure, where are we goi-\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Sorry Anon, uh...\"\n\nShe motions towards another customer that just got in line, giving me an apologetic smile.\n\n...\n\nNot long after I'm waiting for Reed on a shitty worn-out bench, just outside the store. Only a little less confused than before. And a lot more embarrassed.\n\nShe seemed very cool with the whole fucking-like-rabbits-throughout-the-weekend idea. She also looked kinda expectant of the food being for both.\n\nOh, and she said \"your OTHER gee effs\". So that would imply she already is one.\n\nAm I overthinking this?\n\nWith little to no experience about relationships, I have no earthly idea if we're considered a couple now. Or dating.\n\nIs this going to be a date? Shouldn't that have been established beforehand, so we could like, prepare for it? Fancy clothes and stuff.\n\nAlthough that would be awkward with a huge ass bag of groceries.\n\nIn the end I flip out my phone to soothe my nerves with good ol' fashioned shitposting.\n\n>liking r63 Humanaomi shiggy diggy do\n>bet u kiss girls faget\n>inb4 traps aren't gay\n>inb4 cant inb4\n\nOh yeah. Just as the replies start flooding in, loud commotion hits my ears.\n\n[????]\n\"FINE THEN FUCKING GO\"\n\n[Reed?]\n\"OH I WILL\"\n\n[????]\n\"BITCH\"\n\nThe door of the store flings open, and out comes a fucking pissed Reed.\n\nShe slams the door - as much as you can an automated one -, and, uh, suppresses a scream?\n\nOnly when she notices me do her shoulders loosen up, and she lets out a huge sigh.\n\n[Anon]\n\"What happened?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"It's fine, don't worry about it.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"For real? It sounded kinda not fine.\"\n\nShe waves a hand dismissively.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Boss is a cunt, that's all.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"But you didn't like, get fired?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Nah, nothing serious. Can we please drop it?\"\n\nDespite her anger from earlier, she seems cool now. Maybe it really is nothing.\n\nThen again, if I'm to be her boyfriend, shouldn't I be THE person to push these things? Like, get her top open up?\n\nUhhhhhh...\n\nWell, she did say please so I'm totally not a pussy for not asking.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Sure.\"\n\nHer smile almost convinces me that this was the right decision after all.\n\nWe hug it up for a bit, then get the fuck outta dodge. I let Reed lead the way, she knows where we're going.\n\n[Anon]\n\"So um, not to bring up the other thing, but like... Why do you even work, I mean, at all?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I never would have thought that you're like, poor.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Nah, we ain't poor dawg. I just gotta make up for the money I spend on kush.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Wait, your parents know?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Haha, god no!\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"I mean, they might suspect it but they don't like, KNOW know.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Plus I want to save up for a car. Not like that's gonna happen here.\"\n\nSuddenly she looks flustered, like she said more than she should have.\n\n[Reed]\n\"I-I m-mean cause like... It's uh, expensive ya know?\"\n\nWhat was that all about?\n\nBefore I could ask Reed points to one of the run-down dilapidated commie block type buildings bordering Skin Row.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Oh haha, we're here!\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Uh, Reed, what the fuck are we doing here?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"This is where I get my carfe from.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"There's this stego dude on the top floor. Used to be a hunter so he's got connections or something.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Point is, he's been my supplier for I dunno, a year maybe?\"\n\nI really don't know how to respond.\n\nWe scale the stairs in silence, neither of us is overly enthusiastic about trying our luck with the elevator.\n\nMy lungs are about ready to burst when we make it to the top. Reed is visibly out of breath too.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Aight uh... Dude can be a bit of a dick, so... Be prepared.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Prepared for what?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"To jump. Bounce. Skedaddle. That sort of thing.\"\n\nWhat the fuck. Am I about to be shot and collected as a trophy?\n\nI just nod and put on a mean face. Clench my jaw, furrow my brows. That's how that chad thing goes, right?\n\nReed seems amused, but doesn't comment on it.\n\nWe make our way to one of the more secure-looking doors, and she does a combination of knocks and rings.\n\nHow paranoid can this guy really be? Is being a weirdo a stego thing, that's where Stella got it too?\n\nA few locks open on the inside and said stego steps through the doorframe.\n\nHe's tall - taller than me -, but scrawny. His rugged scales are hiding some serious muscle though. Like if you crossed a world class boxer and the shittiest meth addict that you could find.\n\nHe's also got that junkie scratch going on. Jesus.\n\nReed gives him some money, and the guy hands her a paper bag. All without a word.\n\nThat is, until Reed checks the contents of the bag.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Dude, this is only half.\"\n\n[Stego Dude]\n\"Pay half, get half, little girl.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Bullshit half! I've even put in a tip you asshole.\"\n\n[Stego Dude]\n\"Pay half, get half. If you're short on money--\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"I'm not giving you a tuggie, man.\"\n\nUh, what?\n\nReed tries to give the bag back, but the guy doesn't budge. I hope I'm just imagining that bulge in his pants.\n\nYeah, just a trick of shadows haha. Haha.\n\nOH GOD\n\n[Reed]\n\"Give!\"\n\n[Stego Dude]\n\"Nah, don't think so. Have a nice day.\"\n\nJust as he's about to close the door some force compels me the interject.\n\nI step up to the guy, pushing Reed to the side.\n\n[Anon]\n\"You've heard her man. Give.\"\n\nMiraculously, my voice did not crack one bit.\n\nI even push my chest out to appear like, a threat or something.\n\nHe eyes me head to toe. I can't tell what he's thinking.\n\n[Stego Dude]\n\"You think some hired muscle gonna do you anything here, little girl?\"\n\nDespite me standing right in his face, he addresses the words to Reed.\n\nI don't let up though, and keep facing forward.\n\nNo, you know what? Fuck you dickhead junkie wastoid. This is my gee eff.\n\nYears of Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat surely won't let me down.\n\nIt all happens in slow motion.\n\nI raise my left and shove the dude back. He's surprised, but almost immediately finds his footing.\n\nI can faintly hear Reed screaming about \"no\" and \"don't do it\", but it's too late now.\n\nIt's his left cutting through the air now, the one with the money. Going straight for my head.\n\nI shift to the right, avoiding the junkie's fist.\n\nThis may be my only chance to have the upper hand.\n\nCan't. Waste. It.\n\nSPEARS GIVE ME YOUR STRENGTH\n\nI grab onto the guy's extended arm and lock my shoulder under his. Even with our height differences, I'm able to lift him a little.\n\nNo way I can do a suplex, but this should be good enough for a second or two.\n\n[Anon]\n\"REED GET THE FUCKING MONEY\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"DO IT FAGET\"\n\n[Stego Dude]\n\"OH NO YOU DON'T\"\n\nSome heavy-looking thing flashes on the edge of my vision. It connects to my lower back, shooting pain all over my body.\n\nAw fuck his fucking tail.\n\nMy legs turn to jelly, and I let go of the guy before we drop on the floor.\n\nWith my remaining strength I kick him square in the dick and back into his room. He falls down too.\n\nReed closes the door on him and screams into my face.\n\n[Reed]\n\"FUCK ANON RUN\"\n\nYep.\n\nDuring the first few steps my legs almost give out, and Reed has to keep me upright to keep going.\n\nBehind us the guy is opening his door again, so we bolt the fuck down the stairs.\n\nI can't tell if he's giving chase, or like set some dogs on us or something.\n\nWe. Just. Fucking. Run.\n\nAll the way down, and then a couple of corners more.\n\nThe sprint turns into a jog once we're sure that he's gone.\n\nWe turn one last corner into a back alley, and stop to catch our breaths behind a big ass rusty trash container.\n\nThe only thing I can hear is my heart one upping the drummer from Through the Fire and the Flames.\n\nEventually, the cacophony of Skin Row comes back. Dogs barking in the distance, a baby crying somewhere, ghetto music blasting out of the windows, and dirty near radioactive drain water running through it all.\n\nAnd Reed's heavy breathing.\n\nI look at her, and she looks back at me.\n\nNeither one of us is able to speak yet, just huffing and puffing.\n\nA huge grin spreads on her face as she holds up her hand. Unmistakeably, there are a dozen or so crumpled up bills in there. The paper bag in the other.\n\nBefore I could contemplate the significance of ripping off a dealer, I find myself in Reed's embrace.\n\nOut mouths and bodies connect in a lustful kiss, letting out all the spent up adrenalin.\n\nShe pushes me up against the wall, hopping up into my arms. Her legs and tail cross behind my back.\n\nI hold onto her for dear life.\n\nHeated minutes pass like this, us just making out. Reed eventually backs off, gasping for air.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Wanna take this... back to your place... big guy?\"\n\nHeh. For y- WAIT\n\nMy place.\n\nMy...\n\nOh shit.\n\nFuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.\n\nIt dawns on me that I've lost my fucking groceries.\n\nI put Reed down and quickly check my pockets. Thankfully my wallet and keys are there.\n\nShe's looking at me all what-the-fuck-yo like.\n\n[Anon]\n\"The fucking food.\"\n\nIt only takes her a second.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Oh fuck, where did you...?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I don't know. Before the fight.\"\n\nShe sighs, but her smile returns quickly.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Well, you did rescue the money.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"An um, thank you.\"\n\nShe gives me a quick peck on the cheek. This seems to be her trademark gesture.\n\nMoreover - after safely putting the money away -, Reed takes my hand, running her fingers between mine.\n\nI nearly freeze on the spot, my already blushing face turning quite a few shades.\n\nProfound sweating, was it?\n\n[Reed]\n\"Come on you dork!\"\n\nHer tugging on my arm gets me to move eventually.\n\n* * *\n\nWe cross a few more alleys, not daring to go out on the main street just yet. Tiredness catches up with us too, so by the time we make it to a decent looking store we're like walking dead.\n\nIt's close to 8 pm when we get back to the flat, and we're pretty much spent.\n\nIt wasn't such a bad haul though. Got some munchies, another albeit cheaper brand pack of frozen lasagna for Reed, instant noodles, and some miscellaneous sloppa to mix up.\n\nReed's been holding my hand the entire time, not even wanting to let go while paying for our stuff.\n\nFeels good man.\n\nAfter putting all the stuff away we crawl into bed like a couple of geezers. We make out for a bit, but neither of us has the energy to really go farther than that.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Imma go take a shower. Wanna do something after?\"\n\nFuck me, let's go for it.\n\n[Anon]\n\"M-maybe we could um, do it together?\"\n\nShe bites her lip, thinking about the offer.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Sorry Anon, it's too early for that.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"But we like, almost had sex.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Yeah, with clothes on.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I mean we were gonna?\"\n\n...\n\n[Reed]\n\"Sorry, but no.\"\n\n...\n\n[Reed]\n\"I'll make it up for you, aight? I just don't want to, like, rush it? Ya know.\"\n\nWow that sure wasn't the case yesterday.\n\nReed's sudden change of expression tells me that once again, I should stop with the fucking mumbling.\n\nShe looks like she's about to slam the bathroom door in my face, or pack her stuff and go home.\n\nBut she doesn't.\n\nInstead, she returns to the side of the bed.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Yeah, about that...\"\n\nShe's avoiding eye contact.\n\nOh no.\n\nIt was a pity handjob afterall.\n\nI GOT TUGGIE'D MAN\n\nI DON'T WANT TO TURN INTO A METH ADDICT STEGO\n\nI DON'T WANT TO GO TO BRAZIL\n\n[Reed]\n\"I thought you were gonna figure this out but, I um. I wanted to seal the deal, okay?\"\n\nI don't get it.\n\nMy helpless expression probably says as much, cause she just sighs and continues to explain.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Look Anon, I've kinda had a crush on you for um, some time.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"So when you told me that you and Fang broke up... I just didn't want to waste the opportunity.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Please don't think I'm a slut or anything.\"\n\nShe goes silent for a while, but shuts me up when I try to speak up.\n\nLooks like this is painful for her to say.\n\n[Reed]\n\"I was being you know... I wanted to like, sell the whole package so you won't back out.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Please I... I don't want to guilt you into a relationship. All of this was pretty shitty of me to do.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"I don't even know what Fang will think. ...or Trish, for that matter.\"\n\nWow, this is some heavy stuff.\n\nMy gut instinct would say \"Fuck them\", but... They're Reed's friends, and besides, this isn't even the immediate issue.\n\nI mean, is there even an issue here? Who cares how we got together?\n\nLike, okay if she becomes a frigid cunt I'd feel kinda cheated.\n\nI really should say something about now.\n\n[Anon]\n\"I... Don't care?\"\n\nOh god that sounded horrible keep the ball rolling.\n\n[Anon]\n\"I mean, I'm happy that you like me cause I like you too.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"...maybe I feel a little, I dunno, like I've expected you to keep being frisky. But I don't want to rush anything either.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"This morning I wasn't even sure if you gave me a pity jerk off because of Fang. Or if you wanna be fuck buddies or whatever.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"And uh, if that was the case, I mean it would have been cool but... That's just not all I want from you.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Jesus, I can't phrase for shit...\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"And look, if Trish or Fang or whoever has an issue with this, that's on them.\"\n\nEven though my most sincere efforts, my voice still pinches up just a bit both times as I say Fang's name out loud. Once again, there's that bitter aftertaste.\n\nI'm sure Reed noticed it too. I hope that won't be the only thing she takes away from all of this.\n\nI reach for her hand, half expecting her to pull away.\n\nBut she doesn't.\n\nShe doesn't say anything either.\n\n...\n\nQuite a few seconds pass before she speaks up.\n\n[Reed]\n\"You wanna take that shower together?\"\n\nEven my socially inept ass catches onto the fact that she's really asking: \"Do you want a slutty girlfriend, or do you want a Reed girlfriend?\"\n\nOh, this is a nightmare scenario.\n\nIf I say or imply yes, then we're either done for or she'd turn herself into advertisement-Reed to please me.\n\nIf I say no, she might think that I just want to impress her by giving the \"right\" answer. Or that I'm a pushover.\n\nI could try to say I want a slutty-Reed girlfriend... In fact, she might actually be probing for how much I want this. What I expect the relationship to be.\n\nUgh, how do I even...\n\n[Anon]\n\"You know that I would, but what we both want matters more. And that is not fucking this up.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"So ask again if you mean it.\"\n\nThat sounded pretty dope.\n\n...right?\n\nShe takes her time weighing my answer.\n\nIn the end she crawls onto the bed, cuddling up to my side. She still won't make eye contact, but this is progress I guess.\n\nI go for a hug, and she lets it happen. It feels nice, but it's like a so-close-yet-so-far scenario.\n\nOkay Anon, time to cheer up your gee eff.\n\n[Anon]\n\"So, did you even give that guy a tuggie?\"\n\nI try to put on a teasing tone, poking her shoulder.\n\nHer voice is so soft that I almost can't make out what she says.\n\n[Reed]\n\"...yes\"\n\nWait, what?\n\nI sit up, suddenly fucking serious.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Jesus, I just wanted to like, joke around but seriously?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"It was just one time, okay? I was really stressed out, and it was midterms, and Trish was--\"\n\nHer speech speeds up as she talks, till she abruptly cuts herself off. She pulls her legs up under her, clutching onto my arm harder.\n\n[Reed]\n\"...it wasn't just one time.\"\n\nI'm so stunned that I don't even know what to do with this information. It explains both why she was so easy-going about jerking me off, and why she would want to take things slow.\n\nBut this is some fucked up shit.\n\nI don't know what to say.\n\nMy impression of Reed was that she's this lighthearted jokester, but serious when she needs to be. After all, she's mostly top of her classes, apparently has a job...\n\nBut this is another thing in itself.\n\nI'm so deep in thought that I almost miss the next part.\n\n[Reed]\n\"But it hasn't happened lately, okay? And I wouldn't have done it today even if you weren't there. And I won't do it ever again.\"\n\n...not that I could ever know.\n\nBut, okay. I can work with this. Everyone has their own fucked up stuff right? I wasn't transferred here for nothing. Plus whatever Fang stuff I still have to deal with.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Okay.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThe next few weeks were spent building a slow-but-steady relationship upon what brittle foundation we've got left after that day.\n\nIt was in mutual agreement that we don't fucking let anyone at school know. So we're mostly hung out on weekends, sneaking a date or two in there, or a kiss when nobody was looking.\n\nThings were settling into a rhythm of sorts. Plus neither of us have been assassinated by the carfe mafia, so there's that.\n\nWe've never quite made it to having sex, but it wasn't cockblock valley either. Turns out Reed really was a virgin, that just happens to have uh, experience.\n\nOne thing that never sat well with me is that she never wanted me to meet her family. And every time monetary issues came up, she'd quickly change subjects.\n\nFirst I thought this was because of her past with the dealer guy. But it felt more than that. She'd often turn sad after these exchanges, and I never could figure out why.\n\nLately, it started affecting everyday conversation as well. Our not-so-great sex life took a hit of it too.\n\nReed would start distancing herself from me more and more. The past few days she wouldn't even reply to my messages.\n\nAnd then everything went up shit up sideways creek.\n\n* * *\n\nIt's Monday, the last week of the year. After that, only the graduation ceremony.\n\nI haven't seen Reed yet, and she didn't show any sign of activity on social media either.\n\nI'm starting to get fucking worried.\n\nDid carfe guy actually come back for her? Should I call the police?\n\nOkay, calm down.\n\nI'm not the only one who knows her. Let's ask Fa-\n\nLet's ask Trish.\n\nThe next class is science, she should be there.\n\n...\n\nTime ticks away painfully slow till I spot the lil' trigga.\n\nNot caring one bit how it looks, I powerwalk up to her desk.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Have you seen Reed today?\"\n\nHer face contorts into the usual oh-Anon-is-a-fucktard-frown.\n\n[Trish]\n\"Ha-ha, very funny.\"\n\nWhat the fuck is she on about?\n\n[Anon]\n\"I'm serious you asshole, have you?\"\n\n...\n\nFor once she looks deadass sad.\n\n[Trish]\n\"Anon, they're moving to Japan.\"\n\nHer words hit me in the face with the force of a freight train.\n\nI swear that my insides are twisting up into a knot.\n\nNo.\n\nNO\n\nTHIS IS NOT HAPPENING\n\nShe's lying.\n\nIt's Trish. Trish's is a liar!\n\n[Anon]\n\"Fuck you, I want to see her.\"\n\n[Trish]\n\"Fuck YOU! I was her friend before you!\"\n\nI want to shake the lying bitch, throw her out the window, then throw her back in and out again, and--\n\nHer phone buzzes, Reed's face plastered on the screen.\n\nI scoop it up before Trish could do anything about it. Well, no. She actually tries to put up a resistance I just deck her in the jaw and run.\n\nOut of the classroom, almost tackling the teacher just entering. I don't even listen to their protest.\n\nOut of the school, and into the thick of the garden.\n\nOf course, Reed's call has long ended. Maybe she'll answer if I call her on this phone. Or maybe she'll call again.\n\nMy hands are shaking up a storm.\n\nReed...\n\nThey moved away? When? Why? Why wouldn't she tell me?\n\nMy thoughts are a mess, even the coherent parts are jumbled together. A lot of Reed's behavior is now explained, but...\n\nI feel betrayed, to say the least.\n\nI can't handle being in school right now. I know that I couldn't sit still on the bus or in a taxi either.\n\nSo I just run.\n\nMy morning walk that takes up to about an hour flashes by in mere minutes.\n\nReed still hasn't called.\n\nTrish probably told the teacher by now at least. \n\nMaybe the principal.\n\nThe police could be on their way too.\n\nOr my parents.\n\n...\n\nHow could Reed do this to me?\n\nI stare down at the phone in my hands with teary eyes, feeling the depression settle in.\n\nHonestly, what am I doing here? Even if I reach her, what is there to do? What is there to say?\n\nShe's gone, and all I can do is say goodbye.\n\nAs if one cue, the phone rings.\n\nIt's Reed.\n\nI don't answer it. I can't. Not now.\n\n...\n\nMy hand forms a fist around the buzzing phone, as if I was about to crush it into dust.\n\nNo, this can't be how it ends. It just can't.\n\nIt fucking can't.\n\nI will not allow it.\n\nI still have weaponized autism on my side!\n\nThis time, before the call could end I flip my laptop open, the shittiest audio editing software that I've downloaded for Fang is still running.\n\nI click record in the middle of whatever track I was editing and accept the call, on loudspeaker.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Hey, Trish?\"\n\nI don't answer. I can't. Not now.\n\nThere's noise in the background. People speaking, shuffling about. Lots of them. Maybe a megaphone?\n\nNo, Trish said that they're moving! Could it be today?\n\nIt's an announcement system!\n\nI close my eyes, trying to make a mental list of it all.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Hey, are you there?\"\n\nA louder, clearer male voice overlaps with Reed.\n\n[????]\n\"Come on, we don't have that much time.\"\n\nIt's probably her dad. They're about to board a... train? A plane?\n\nI hear Reed sigh, and the call ends not long after.\n\nI stop the recording, and get to work with all of my knowledge of sound engineering.\n\n...which is not a lot.\n\nI delete huge chunks of the previous song in the process, but I don't care.\n\nI just need to clean it up enough to make out the announcements.\n\nAt the same, I'm pulling up all nearby transport hotspots and plotting travel routes for Japan.\n\nMy patience ends soon, so I go through the recoding again. The only parts I can make out are maybe \"boarding group\"?\n\nIt's a plane!\n\nI check the schedules and-\n\nAll of my hopes are once again crushed.\n\nThere is no way I can make it there in time.\n\nShe's literally out of my reach now.\n\n...\n\nWait, maybe...\n\nAccording to the website, they're taking a flight with a stopgap in the middle. Maybe they couldn't book tickets in advance, or maybe they don't have the money for a better flight.\n\nPoint is, there is another flight that would arrive before theirs.\n\nI double, triple check the departure and arrival terminals. It could work.\n\nIt has to work!\n\nThe ticket is pricey as fuck, especially since it's last minute. Almost all of my savings, gone.\n\nBut money is no object for a quest such as this.\n\nStill, I barely have enough time to buy it and call a taxi.\n\nI leave Trish's phone behind. I desperately want to take it with me, if only to hear Reed's voice.\n\nBut I don't. There's only one end to this story, and it will be a happy one.\n\nBy the time I arrive at the airport their plane has long taken off. Mine should be boarding in the next few minutes.\n\nThank fuck Trish didn't get the police involved after all. Maybe she understood the situation?\n\nI doubt it, but she also had no other reason not to rat me out.\n\n* * *\n\nIt's a long flight, but I don't sleep one bit.\n\nAfter landing, it should take about ten more hours for Reed and her family to get here.\n\nI double and triple check again. This is the terminal they should arrive at.\n\nI'm about reduced to a mumbling mess of shaky limbs by the time their plane is announced.\n\nIn the past few hours I've gone over it again and again, but...\n\nWhat if Reed won't be happy to find me here?\n\nShe left me on purpose.\n\nShe cut me off.\n\nCould this have all been for nothing?\n\nPlus stealing her friend's phone, tracking her down here... That's creepy to normal people, right?\n\n...\n\nMy mind just about goes blank when I spot her in the crowd.\n\nI take a deep breath and look down at my hands.\n\nThey're holding a sign with the letters R E E D on it.\n\nThe R has a heart around it.\n\nI want to hold it up, but my body won't move.\n\nThis is my moment, yet I'm too frozen up to take it.\n\nKnees week.\n\nArms are heavy.\n\nThere's vo-\n\nNO FUCK FOCUS\n\nI can't see Reed anymore, the crowd is getting too thick.\n\nGuess it's up to her now.\n\nI take one last deep breath, and hold the sign up high in the air, waving it around a bit for good measure.\n\nA second passes.\n\nAnd another.\n\nA minute, and then two.\n\nI don't let go.\n\nAnd then...\n\nA familiar red-ping figure singles out of the crowd.\n\nShe's visibly shook, like she can't comprehend what she's seeing.\n\nHer eyes are puffy and red. She's obviously been crying.\n\nCarefully, she touches my elbow, as if to check that I'm real.\n\nHer voice is faint and cracking.\n\n[Reed]\n\"...A-Anon?\"\n\nI can't muster up the strength to talk, so I just nod.\n\nI don't know what to do.\n\nA few seconds pass in silence.\n\nThis isn't awkward, it's just that neither of us knows what to do with the situation.\n\nHer hand that still lingers on my elbow twitches. At first, it looks like she will remove it, but instead it slowly moves to my face.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Anon?\"\n\nShe tears up, embracing me in a tight hug. One that I hastily reciprocate.\n\nReed's mumbling something into my chest, but I can't make any sense of it.\n\nTruly, it is raining already.\n\nWe stand there for a while. I notice a few bystanders who I assume to be her family.\n\nI don't give a fuck.

After Spears caught us on the roof, huddled in tears and streaks of clown makeup, I could only imagine the saccharine music and shitty backdrops from something like Saikano.\n\nBut this was real, and when Fang looked to me, messy and exposed - at her weakest, the sun played off the contours of her pale skin. The feeling I got was beyond anything horny. I wasn\u2019t prepared for it. \n\nIf I were a shithead as usual, I would\u2019ve laughed at girls like this: a confused mess of a mouthy, likely bipolar teen throwing a fit over some petty nothing. That, or an abstract garbling of baggage: memories without context. \n\nBut she rang true to me when she cried. She spoke so clearly.\n\nI could imagine the crunch of cartilage as Naser bounced from the side of that bluff\u2026\n\nShe needed help, and I managed to keep my face shut until something actually worked out, but I can\u2019t do this alone.\n\n--\n\nIt was only the next school day when I found my sights locked onto the back of Reed\u2019s frazzled, pink head in class.\n \nHow could he be helpful, this spaced out raptor? I can\u2019t even think of a way to dismiss him. He\u2019d be a great scholar if not for his dudeisms. Then again, plenty of geniuses are social retards, or just retards in general\u2026\n\nThe soft 'shlip' of paper slid under my elbow. The pink, taloned hand of said dino handed me another completed sheet of math work.\n\n\u201cYo bro. You alright? You look frazzled,\u201d he asked.\n\nI glanced up and a shiver shot down my spine. His breath sprayed cheap vodka into my eyes and nose. The sting overwhelmed me. I wanted to call him an idiot for cheating so loudly, but then I noticed the teacher wasn\u2019t in the room.\n\nThe cheat sheet even had a different style of handwriting from his.\n\n\u201cChill,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m a logistic bog-witch.\u201d\n\n\u201cO-okay,\u201d was all I could respond with. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t get a read on Reed\u2026\n\n--\n\nLunch passed uneventfully in the auditorium. Trish was still a bitch and Fang was still Fang, if not irritable and exhausted.\n\nI\u2018d imagine she\u2019s still recovering from yesterday. She\u2019d probably been locked into bad habits for a long time. I remembered what I set out to do, and avoiding the gaze of the tiny tyrant I followed the ratcheting of a socket-wrench until I found Reed.\n\nHe was huddled in the corner, head down and ass up for mecca as he tinkered away on some pile of scrap. I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it.\n\nShould I nudge him? His eyes were focused pinpricks and his tongue worked its way out of his muzzle.\n\nDon\u2019t say \u2018blep\u2019\u2026\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to notice\u2026 or fixate\u2026 on a pair of ripe peaches waxing from the waistline of his loose pants. He had a round butt for a guy, especially such a lean one. How does he get so fit? Does he play sports or is he more practical; delivering carfe by bicycle like that Josh Peck movie? \n\nEverything, from this scene to my line of thinking, matched many monsterfuck scenarios often splooged about over a certain Columbian waterskiing board\u2026\n\nHis tail stood straight up, like a foxtail swaying in the wind. A bulb of downy feathers slapped across my face as I stood transfixed. This forest of twee and all the collective germs he picked up clogged my fucking nose all at once.\n\nI sneezed like a shotgun onto his ass\u2026\n\n\u201cDude!?\u201d Reed shrieked before his head slammed the underside of a stack of band chairs (the roof to his \u2018secret lab\u2019) with a hard 'clunk'!\n\n\u201cYou absolute dweebs!\u201d Fang shouted between gasps and exploded into laughter with Trish.\n\nMISSION FAILED! ABORT MISSION!\n\n--\n\nThe results of all this actually came to some good: Reed, as if hitting a switch in his cloudy, stoner brain, seemed intent on hanging out with me after school. My fingers twitched at the prospect. They needed the familiar crust of my keyboard to slide across, and I don\u2019t blame them for that.\n\nNo. I couldn\u2019t back down now, this could be the only chance to talk to Reed about Fang, alone, with no trigging about.\n\n--\n\nBefore I knew it, I was suffocating in Reed\u2019s astrovan. Smoke constantly billowed from the AC. A device like a respirator fed into it, wheezing as it pumped out dancing purple clouds.\n\nAll I had to do was mention skin row and we decided to visit his place.\n\nHis usual relaxed smile faltered, however, and his mouth tightened into a hard, straight line as he pulled a full u-turn at thirty miles and hour and slid into a perfect parallel park between two corvettes.\n\n\u201cHoly shit. I\u2019m getting a contact high!\u201d I gasp and trip out of the side door Reed opened for me. \n\n\u201cI wish.\u201d Reed said, stifling a chuckle.\n\nThe entire neighborhood was peach and white, pristine and without a single blemish on even the sidewalk. Reed\u2019s house was a two-story, puebloan styled deal with stucco spackled walls and those blue, shiny roofing shingles you see thieves trip over in fantasy novels.\n\nReed helped me to my feet, looking up to an open window right above the garage. \n\n\u201cAlright, man. Just climb the RV and swooce right into my room,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYour parents don\u2019t like friends over?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cKeep it respectful, on the downlow,\u201c Reed said, barely audible. His jaw clenched with what might be actual stress.\n\nWe climbed the back ladder of the massive RV diagonally parked across the driveway. I followed the peach raptor\u2019s stealthy footsteps. Just below us, the mobile home vibrated. A strange, high pitched hum was heard.\n\nIs that a compressor or something? Are they making meth in there?\n\nAs we scaled the roof, we kept our stances low and wide. I felt like a tiny cartoon mouse scurrying across a minefield of suburban utility traps. Each tile looked and felt like a plate of blue china as it rumbled beneath our feet.\n\nJust outside the window to Reed\u2019s room, we stood to brace ourselves against the wall. From there, I saw over their tall fence and into the side yard. Several strange power tools and compression hoses laid out in the open while a pair of small kids, a raptor and a trike, bounced on the trampoline with a pair of chipped decoration swords. They swung at each other\u2019s blades, letting out harsh clangs as they embraced a level of wolfjoy I wouldn\u2019t even condone.\n\n--\n\nReed\u2019s room was pretty cool, complete with hand-me-down beanbag chairs and a makeshift fridge full of icy mountain brews. A widescreen blared to life, and after some tinkering with translator cables he managed to run an old creamcube on it.\n\n\u201cHaha. Nice. Fuck chunky pixels,\u201d he said.\n\nHe then booted up a game. The harsh font choices and squealing sound design immediately struck me as something familiar.\n\nUpon pressing start on a little round toddler controller, the narrator screamed, \u201cKiller\u2019s Heaven!\u201d\n\nThen I remembered it; an \u2018obscure gaming\u2019 thread on an underwater basket weaving forum. Some nerd kept harping about godzilla superiority from how they made toys for children. I told him he sucked radiation lizard cock and it opened a floodgate for schizo-nats.\n\nAh, my first ban. Warms my heart.\n\n\u201cSmilin\u2019 already, eh? Killer\u2019s Heaven does that to you. It\u2019s a real treat, man. You can\u2019t show this game to just anyone.\u201d\n\nIs this my reward for sneezing on your ass?\n\nThe rounded tip of Reed\u2019s peach snout burned hot red.\n\nDid he hear me say that?\n\n\u201cD-dude. Just give it a shot.\u201d\n\n--\n\nI gotta admit, I have no clue what the hell this game\u2019s about, but it\u2019s pretty engrossing. It also helps to have Reed rambling about it non-stop, to tip me on what to do.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re like you, but an old guy, and a human, and like five other dudes who find invisible terrorists and fuck their shit up.\u201d\n\nI flickered the \u2018soul radar\u2019 to spot several meat-creatures with jagged teeth. Then, an NPC voiced by Jimmy Neutron babbled something before getting grappled and exploding into gore.\n\n\u201cSuicide bombers?\u201d I muttered.\n\n\u201cYeah man. They\u2019re the Heaven Smile. They\u2019re like, not just a political thing, but a virus spread by this Vietnamese death god or some shit. It\u2019s really clever once you get around the foreign symbolism\u2026 and stuff\u2026\u201d Reed interjected again, more ecstatic than I ever heard him before. His massive, pink palm tree of a tail slammed the ground with hefty thumps.\n\nI spent the next twenty minutes collecting keys and solving baby puzzles between shooting gallery sections with the Heaven Smile. The design parts of this game were dated, but it\u2019s certainly interesting.\n\n--\n\t\nWhat felt like hours passed. I decided to stop playing after a group of Mahjong players shot each other to death. Reed watched over my progress occasionally, but was preoccupied with scribbling on a notepad. He whispered numbers to himself until he noticed the shooting sounds ceased.\n\nHe then planted his clawed foot on my shoulder. How he fits talons that big into shoes, I have no idea. I didn\u2019t want to know, either. I hope to Raptor Jesus that he was just too lazy to lean over and use his hand.\n\n\u201cMan, you pick up real quick. Thanks a lot, dude. This game means a lot to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t use me as a footrest.\u201d I replied.\n\nReed chuckled and obliged.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s up with the butane!\u201d A voice roared.\n\n\u201cStop cussing in the house!\u201d A woman replied.\n\n\u201cShut it, gold trigger! This is my house, got it!?\u201d\n\nThe walls pounded and the crying of young saurs rang out.\n\nAre they sacrificing a goat to CPS out there?\n\nReed scoffed. His pink, smiley demeanor hardening. His lips pulled back to reveal razor sharp, interlocked teeth. He marched up to his door and tested about three different locks, making sure we were secure from his family\u2019s politics.\n\n\u201c\u2026Methy faggots\u2026\u201d he growled to himself, then looked to me with wide, panicked eyes. Embarrassment washed over him and he felt the need to say, \u201cA-Anon. Sorry about\u2026 this. Just keep chill, alright. I got us shacked up right here.\u201d\n\nHe was the only one \u2018unchilled\u2019. \n\nI thought about reloading Killer\u2019s Heaven just to avoid his pacing and the cacophony outside, but instead I asked him something, at least to distract us: \u201cWhy do you like Killer\u2019s Heaven so much. I always thought you were a-\u201d\n\nDON\u2019T SAY CASUAL.\n\n\u201c-Xrox bro.\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s tail swished. His aquamarine eyes widened toward mine. He was very, very sentimental toward this game. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, such a huge game man. It covers so much stuff\u2026 but I always liked the idea of the Heaven Smile. It\u2019s like, some people are terrorists in saurian scales, err\u2026 human skin-\u201d Reed said, then shot me with finger guns.\n \nI contemplated jumping out the window, but I chose this pain.\n\n\u201c-To the most part,\" he continued, \"we think we\u2019re doing the right thing, y\u2019know, but who knows if you\u2019ve been infected? You look normal until the demon bursts out, then all you can do is hurt people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty goofy, I get it. They\u2019re like 9\/11 zombies, but I always imagine a completely normal dude going home to see his wife. Maybe they\u2019re both hurting inside. Maybe he sheltered her until she\u2019s like\u2026 too dependent to do anything, y\u2019know?\u2026 Anyways, I imagine him smiling to her, but it\u2019s a hollow smile. The smile spreads across his head until his skull flips open and BAM! HEAVEN SMILE!\u201d\n\nWhat the fuck? \n\nMy mouth slowly shapes itself into some vague vowel, but nothing comes to mind, nothing worth saying.\n\nThen it hit me, I imagined him and Trish and Fang together. They were always together, so why did she need to consolidate in me?\n\nI looked up to Reed, who smiled dreamily and stared out his window. It was the only source of natural light in the room, (not much different from mine except for his circuit boards and blinking technolights). The waning sun showered him in orange-red. It complemented his softer pink tone and recolored his body in its image, and as the sun crept over the horizon, burning away slowly, a shadow grew from the tips of his hair downward, as if he\u2019d melt away.\n\n\u201cReed. You reminded me of something. It\u2019s about Fang,\u201d I said, before the moment was lost.\n\nReed blinked, then looked down to me and scratched his head. \u201cYeah? Oh right! She was really messed up lately. Is she okay?\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cShe cried her eyes out.\u201d\n\n\u201cBummer.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was preening too.\u201d\n\nReed sunk his head and closed his eyes. His brow furrowed.\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d he muttered.\n\n\u201cShe told me about what happened with Naser. Look, I didn\u2019t wanna pry at first. I didn\u2019t give a shit back then, but you\u2019re supposed to be her friend. Why am I the one who needed to do this?\u201d\n\nThe wooden bed rest next to Reed cracked as his nails sunk into it, but Reed\u2019s expression was still soft.\n\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not good with this stuff, man. Leave that to Trish. She\u2019s more\u2026 emotionally involved with identity\u2026 and all that stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s too controlling. I don\u2019t even know if she means well about it. She didn\u2019t want Fang to play guitar for how long now? And you didn\u2019t do anything about that either.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to commit to an idea, you know\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be a neutral party when there\u2019s three people voting. You took Trish\u2019s side every time, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s ass slammed onto his bed with how hard that comment hit. He wrung his hand across his forearm like a frightened child.\n \nMy cheeks burned and my spit boiled as I gave him another verbal lashing, \u201cShe looked so happy on the guitar. Her mind races to life and her tail beats out little rhythms. How could you not notice that?\u201d\n\nWhy did I say that? \n\nReed then leaned forward, taking the obvious chance to dismiss me entirely, \u201cLook, man. Fang is a passionate lady. I know you got the hots for her, but we know her better. If she didn\u2019t want to play bass that badly she could\u2019ve left. It\u2019d be bunk for her to lie by omission to friends like that.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you did at the concert?\u201d\n\nFuck. Again, a network of phones have trapped me in their web of gossip.\n \nI didn\u2019t try to refute that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard the way you mumble about me before. You can\u2019t do stoichiometry, or even algebra, and you think I\u2019m stupid\u2026\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s voice rumbled with a low growl. The \u2018guns\u2019 draped off of his broad surfer\u2019s shoulders trembled like iron in a forge. A hint of his dagger teeth gleamed from under his soft lips again.\n\nAs soon as it came, the tension bottled into this cramped room -- trapped within the thin walls of this turbulent shithole -- released. With a soft exhale, Reed composed himself, although he glared at me from under his brow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, bro,\u201d he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t wanna get mean. I try not to let it get to me, and that\u2019s why Fang likes me. My friends and I, we go through rough shit, but we have passions and we help each other with-.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want to say this, but I recalled what she said when we were gardening for detention, back when I spaghetti\u2019d about being at the concert: \u201cFang said you were useless to her, like a weed. She said you were a stepping stone for her success.\u201d\n\nThat hit Reed like a mallet to the noggin. I swear his hair blew back. His chill, laid back posture withered into a tired old man\u2019s instantly. He crumpled onto his bed. He turned away from me. His tail retreated between his legs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true\u2026\u201d Reed said. His voice was so quiet, like a far cry from the mountains.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hanging out with you guys a lot recently. Usually, you talk to me. I haven\u2019t seen you talk to Fang much at all, only Trish.\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s hands trembled around the massive bush at his tail tip. His fingers jostled the frilly downy feathers.\n\nYou better not start preening too. I\u2019m not playing therapist for all you freaks.\n\nI almost wish he heard that this time, because now Reed\u2019s delightful family were complaining about lost poppies, very loudly. At least the kids stopped crying now.\n\n\u201cAm I really that pathetic to you? Did you come over just to tear me apart? You were the outsider she needed, better than any of us.\n\n\u201cSometimes, being a friend really locks me up. I- I\u2019m so afraid to talk to them because of their love\u2026 Like, I told a vato to fuck off after he couldn\u2019t pay for carfe yesterday, but\u2026 I don\u2019t want Fang or Trish\u2026 to hate me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wear a heaven\u2019s smile, and you\u2019re infecting them by being so complacent.\u201d\n\nThat was the single gayest thing I ever said.\n\n\u201cI know. I always knew it, but I\u2019m weak,\u201d Reed said. He rolled over to face me this time. His eyes were like pools of ocean water, not the snot green crap but the stuff you only find on the coasts of war torn nations. His welling, blue eyes trembled with barely restrained tears that flowed down his sharp, angular cheekbones. \n\nFuck. If I end up going Rance on every student in this goddamn school Spears can\u2019t blame me. Look at this. He\u2019s lounging like a girl in some renaissance painting, tail between his legs and weeping openly to me. There was something beautiful about this moment, but maybe I was just seeking control. Maybe Trish gets really huffy over these sorts of breakthroughs.\n\nI can see why she does it now.\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t controlling, bro. It\u2019s cool.\u201d He snorted wetly and blinked away his tears. \u201cSides\u2019, you\u2019re not getting any of my drug money until you kill a fed. That\u2019s how you prove loyalty to me.\u201d\n\nReed managed to peel himself upright. You never realize how much you miss the radiant grin on his mug until it\u2019s gone, but it was back now, and this time it wasn\u2019t spacey, but crisp. He was actually here.\n\nJust then, several thumps of boots drew near the door. Shouts of compressed air blew holes through each of Reed\u2019s locks, one-by-one.\n\nI expanded my catalog of Reed emotions today, but that\u2019s how it always is, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s like a really nice ice cream man who gives you free treats, but he used to work for the mob. \n\nYou never really know someone until you see him growling and thrashing at his older brother. \n\n\u201cFuck you, Rhine! I invented bolt breaking in this fucking house!\u201d Reed shrieked before a large palm slammed his head into a dresser.\n\n--\n\nYou may wonder: Anon, why are you sitting there while your friend fights against a doper freak with a switchblade?\n\nIt\u2019s because they\u2019re raptors. Look at that pink blur. It\u2019s like two bobcats murdered an entire drag show and fought for the scraps.\n\nRhine was larger than Reed, but the latter was surprisingly good with reversals. It\u2019s hard to see someone with his stature (namely the gangly legs) wrestle like that, but what do I know? I just fuck around on the internet.\n\n\u201cYou gonna stab me this time, bro? Hah! Fucking pussy!\u201d Reed growled confidently as he locked his thighs around the assailant\u2019s head. Nothing but the hair of Rhine\u2019s mop top stuck out from the growing mountains of leg muscle now straining the limits of his jeans.\n\n\u201cDrop it. Drop it, buddy, or I\u2019ll bust you like a watermelon. You think our fake dad - or you - can mix the fine carfe? Your brew is dangerous, amigo. I can\u2019t have you hurting our customers.\u201d\n\nAs the stiletto blade thunked tip-first into the carpet, Reed thought aloud, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Anon. It\u2019s all about stepping up.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019ll pay you six-hundred bones to let me stay at your place, because we gotta jet, like right now.\u201d","Title":"Pink Fuzz","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Anonymous","Summary":"Reed has always been a unique one, but it turns out there is a lot more going on with Volcano High's resident carfentanyl enjoyer."},"Pink Fuzz Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Reed And Reeda","Pink Fuzz Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Pink Fuzz 2: Fairy Boy\r\n\r\n     Reed\u2019s lanky limbs thumped harshly against the innards of a cramped, creaking, wooden raft. The stink of mold forced him to clamp his snout shut and squint, as if he could filter the germs. Anxiety flowed through him like millions of needles pressed through his back and around his skull. \r\n     A familiar buzzing reminded him of how much he hated this place. This constant noise hummed harshly enough to ring through his teeth, and he noticed a concrete tunnel close in around him, with a sprawl of power lines running like vines throughout. Some of them were bundled at over a square foot in diameter.\r\n     The wires dripped with mold and a strange, syrupy substance. Their rubber insulators stripped away into the sludge, exposing splintered, frayed copper that shot arcs of electricity like spitting cobras. The water his raft once sailed on grew thicker, and the horrid reek nearly choked him out.\r\n     Just then, he saw someone, another pink raptor much larger than him. He adorned a snout-shaped welder\u2019s mask and haphazardly touched live cables. He giggled as contacts were made and the wires screeched in protest. Then, he\u2019d test two more cables before crunching numbers with a sheet and calculator.\r\n     Reed\u2019s eyes shot wide open. He lurched forward and waved for the saur\u2019s attention, nearly capsizing himself into the rotten, nacho cheese-like muck.\r\n     \u201cDad! Just take the day off!\u201d Reed screamed. \r\n     But he didn\u2019t hear him.\r\n     \u201cDad!\u201d Reed called between retching, the miasma taking a toll on his lungs.\r\n     A wave of sludge crested and slapped his boat back. The sudden flood shot him upward. He huddled in his tiny raft; small, quiet, and helpless. The vessel crashed into the ceiling of the underground workway, scraping the rims off his only means of safety. The pink stoner dared to peak over the gnarled jaws of wood:\r\n     The wave crested like a foaming pair of claws, and engulfed his father completely. The sheer impact displaced the torrent just behind it enough to slam the raft into the ceiling with full force. The vessel and raptor inside scraped into a pink dust against the jagged concrete.\r\n     All went dark.\r\n     The pink dust flowed uneasily, each of its bits drifting further apart, wandering around tiny paths, leading to nowhere.\r\n     A blast of hot sun overwhelmed the pink dust, and a breezy sky of pure blue smothered the black away. \r\n     A massive pirate ship drifted toward the dust. The sheer tactile force of sea salt and wind and heat flocculated each chunk until it formed a large ball of clay. The clay then sculpted itself back into Reed, who waved toward the massive vessel.\r\n     He cried for joy when it noticed him, and from the bow of this mighty vessel, two figures cheered:\r\n     \u201cPirate Princess Lucy and First Mate Trish Trisaber have arrived!\u201d\r\n\r\n     Reed gasped and jilted upright in Anon\u2019s bathtub, armed with only a damp sleeping bag. Cold sweat poured over him. He forced his cramped muscles to move. As the sleeping bag tumbled off of him, the strong smell of fear-musk leaked out.\r\n     \u201cN-no way,\u201d Reed whimpered. He hurriedly trapped the overwhelming scent by balling the bag as tightly as possible.\r\n     After a hasty change of clothes, he fled Anon\u2019s abode as soon as possible, and guiltily tip-toed down the stained carpets, egg-yellow walls, and uncomfortably bright florescent lights of Anon\u2019s apartment complex until he found a washing machine to stuff his shame in. \r\n     It\u2019s bad enough he musked at this age\u2026\r\n     A pink raptor with his slovenly, laid back, upper class attire was enough of a target in skin row. However, he had plenty of clients here. Even if they couldn\u2019t handle the carfe, they flocked to his null-weed, substitute amphets, business psychedelics, the works\u2026\r\n     \u201cWoah! Is that you, Ranky?\u201d a gruff, human voice made Reed swing around on his heels, but the dino didn\u2019t lose his composure. In fact, he was loosey-goosey; taking on his usual slouch with an arm slung behind his head.\r\n     Reed recognized the man.\r\n     \u201cOh hey! Howsit goin, bro? And\u2026 it\u2019s Reed.\u201d he replied.\r\n     \u201cThis is my home. Welcome to paradise, buddy. What the hell are you doing in a place like this? You smell fucking raw.\u201d\r\n     Even over his overheating-and-nightmare induced reek, he caught whiffs of skinnies sneaking around the corners of hallways. They were always good at that, even as the savages in movies.\r\n     With a calculated response, Reed locked both arms behind his head in faux-relaxation, forcing anyone around him to embrace the floodgates of his now open armpits.\r\n     \u201cWhat, you wanna smell?\u201d Reed issued that as a challenge. \u201cThis is the scent of a fine, hard-working courier of medical properties.\u201d\r\n     The man stomped toward him, but Reed kept his half-lidded expression locked on.\r\n     \u201cYeah? Well your medicine put Ronnie in the hospital last week. What am I supposed to tell the guys after that? You fucked me over, \u2018buddy\u2019.\u201d\r\n     Reed heard footsteps closing in from all around this skin nest: a labyrinth of equidistant, narrow hallways.\r\n     \u201cWe can figure this out together. I never do a bro wrong, so it\u2019s not me.\u201d Reed smiled his usual sunny smile.\r\n     The human\u2019s face, tan and gaunt, wrinkled into an even deeper frown, but his eyes avoided Reed\u2019s aquamarine lenses of truth (and Reed caught that). \u201cWell, we think it was you\u2026\u201d\r\n     \u201cYou can\u2019t pull a raptor out of your hat. You bought from another guy, or is there another peachy raptor with guns like these?\u201d he aims two finger guns to the motionless man, then fires: \r\n     \u201cPew.\u201d\r\n     The footsteps pounded down the paper-thin floorway. An inevitable scuffle drew closer.\r\n     Before he could shoulder the chunker aside and sprint for his life, something hard slammed into his chest, sweeping him off his feet instantly.\r\n     The harsh lights lining the ceiling burned spirals into his vision, and before he hit the ground he heard giggling children, human children probably. The complex was so foreign to him he couldn\u2019t tell where their voices came from, but he heard them laugh and play:\r\n     \u201cYarrgh!\u201d \r\n     \u201cA-hoy, yee matey!\u201d\r\n     \u201cThis is the Royal Navy, release the orphanarium at once. We will give into your demands\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n     The school bell rang through Volcano High. It was science class with Fang again. I needed someone to distract from all the strange apparati Reed left strewn across my room. If he didn\u2019t try to synthesize my household cleaners into \u2018pep boosters\u2019 in my freezer, I\u2019d think he was a narc with all the thrift store clothes he had stuffed in his bags.\r\n     He wasn\u2019t even at my place this morning. He just left this schizoid note: a paragraph of scrawl all crossed out, with only a, \u201cThanks, man!\u201d as legible handwriting.\r\n     The money sure helped, though, and I can\u2019t complain when the guy made a mean shepherd's pie.\r\n     I didn\u2019t even know peas could taste so sweet, and I was the omnivore of our pair.\r\n     \u201cHey dweeb. Stop mumbling about pie. People are staring.\u201d Fang\u2019s voice, stern and sharp, booted me back into the waking world. The sharp of her elbow dug into my side.\r\n     \u201cWhat kind of curriculum is Fernsworth running here? I swear we were doing electron pairs last week. Are we pushing into bio already?\u201d I asked.\r\n     \u201cI dunno. That\u2019s why I have you.\u201d\r\n     \u201cThanks\u2026\u201d\r\n     Pages two-fifteen to two-twenty four elaborated on the \u2018fantastic\u2019 world of mycology. It included a story about some egghead who worked on ergot infested rye. He accidentally synthesized LSD for the first time and spilled it all over himself, getting really high in the process.\r\n     I had a feeling Reed would like this. \r\n     Speaking of\u2026\r\n     \u201cHey, Fang. I got to hang out with Reed yesterday?\u201d I said.\r\n     \u201cReally?\u201d Fang replied. Her amber eyes shot through me like headlights, eager to distract themselves from the workbook. \u201cDid he use you as a mule?\u201d\r\n     \u201cHe invited me over. We played some weird game on a dated console.\u201d\r\n     \u201cHuh? What\u2019s his place like?\u201d\r\n     Keep it smooth, Anon.\r\n     \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 interesting. He has one of those stylish houses on the east end, the ones with fancy roof shingles.\r\n     \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re a guy, I bet.\u201d \r\n     What?\r\n     \u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n     \u201cI\u2019ve hung out with Reed almost as long as I knew Trish. We go way back. Whenever I asked about his place he always deflected, even in his fairy days.\u201d\r\n     \u201cFairy days?\u201d\r\n     A set of jet black fingernails planted themselves across Fang\u2019s long, narrow snout, failing to conceal the flush against her white, glowing skin.\r\n     \u201cHeheh~. Never mind. Those were old days. We were different people back then.\u201d\r\n     If I let slip that I told Reed what Fang said, that \u2018weed\u2019 comment, she\u2019d probably get pissed. At the same time, she did say I should always be truthful to her.\r\n     I decided to pry the middle ground of this quandary:\r\n     \u201cHow do you feel about Reed now?\u201d\r\n     Fang\u2019s eyes narrowed to me for a moment. The thick red of her eyeliner accentuated like the brow of a demon. \r\n     Did I say something suspicious?\r\n     After some thought, she replied, \u201cI envy the guy.\u201d\r\n     \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n     \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\r\n     \u201cYou\u2019re so engrossed in your music. I didn\u2019t think you could envy a dude\u2026 like\u2026-\u201d\r\n     \u201cReed gets around. He knows a lotta back alleys for a guy who drives everywhere. Like, I knew he ran \u2018sales\u2019, but I still have to lay a smackdown or duck out of family crap when burnouts keep asking me for his new burner number.\r\n     \u201cI wish he spoke up a bit more, but aside from running around maybe he doesn\u2019t have much going on up there,\u201d she says, and points to her noggin. \u201cHe could be trying to lick every window in town, for all I know.\u201d\r\n     \u201cHe has to have something going on if he\u2019s this multi-talented genius. I\u2019ve always seen him handle VVURM DRAMA\u2019s wiring.\u201d\r\n     Fang smirked. Her eyes narrowed into slits, which somehow only intensified the beams of her amber eyes. She mastered the countenance of a Cheshire cat.\r\n     \u201cDid you guys fuck?\u201d she asked pointedly, just as the bell rang.\r\n\r\n     Bing-Bong! Ding-Dong!\r\n     And now it was math with Carl-somethingski.\r\n     \u201cParasite,\u201d was Trish\u2019s greeting to me. Given how hard and fast her thumbs tacked away across her smartphone and the hard bite on her lower lip, she was obviously arguing on hornblr. Only that place could host such a neurotic brew of ethical naval gazing intermixed with twee porn.\r\n     I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was an experiment on the limits of dopamine burnout.\r\n     It took me a moment to realize Reed was even there. Until he greeted me, I only registered the desk next to Trish as a pile of stale clothes wrapped in a tan longcoat and a sun hat. That didn\u2019t even account for the rose-colored shield sunglasses taking up half his face.\r\n     Exhausted after being the emotional sponge of two-thirds of their band, I told myself to take a break, and didn\u2019t even ask.\r\n     As usual, this was essentially a free period. Reed jotted down each row and column of Arabian moonrune algebra, and made a copy for myself. We found ourselves chatting about science (I think he still remembered the rail cannon bit). We speculated so many potential weapons made of PVC and stump remover that Trish could barely moderate her anger between us and her phone.\r\n     I didn\u2019t even care if other students heard us. Reed was so laid back they probably couldn\u2019t register what we were saying. \r\n     I had to admit, the guy was a secret badass.\r\n     I went on to mention the LSD related lesson in science class, but Reed\u2019s face softened at the mention of it.\r\n     \u201cAbout that,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cHow is Fang doing\u2026 after the preening thing?\u201d he whispered.\r\n     \u201cShe what!?\u201d Trish roared. The phone fumbled in her mitts like a bar of soap before she pocketed it.\r\n     GORE ALERT!\r\n\r\n     \u201cWhy did the skinnie learn about this before me?\u201d the tiny tyrant growled as we looked to the pink slips guaranteeing our detention. Screaming tended to interrupt class, especially when the school losers got dramatic. \r\n     To the fault of our nation\u2019s school system, sharing a bench outside the office only made it easier for Trish to strike without the chiding eyes of the student body. Spears wasn\u2019t in, either, so the only man capable of holding the purple plaintiff back was Reed, whose biceps bulged even beneath his sleeves as he struggled to restrain her her fierce, club-like arms.\r\n     \u201cE-easy, Trish,\u201d Reed strained.\r\n     \u201cJust let me nail him. Just once!\u201d\r\n     \u201cNuh-uh.\u201d\r\n     \u201cWhyyy? You let me pound everyone else who deserved it. I\u2019ve jammed raptors into lockers twice your size, if strength\u2019s the issue.\u201d\r\n     \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not.\u201d Reed replied. His arms almost gave way to the trig\u2019s willpower. \r\n     He winced a lot more than I\u2019d expect. I almost wanted to bail him out.\r\n     \u201cAll he\u2019s done is snoop on us. No one gave a shit about our gang until now. Why does he get to help Fang?\u201d\r\n     Reed had to lean with all his might to keep Trish back.\r\n     Was she that strong?\r\n     Then Reed said something, as coolly as usual, \u201cFirst-mate Trish Trisaber: Legend of the Seven Seas.\u201d\r\n     \u201cDon\u2019t. Not in front of him.\u201d the triceratops demanded, but the phrase shocked her out the rage trance.\r\n     \u201cI used to wear a collared button-up. Can\u2019t even imagine that stuff now, eh, Anon?\u201d\r\n     I nodded, but had no idea what he was talking about.\r\n     \u201cFang used to be the captain, our Princess Pirate. She kept the namesake, but she was too wild to stay at\u2026 what was her castle called?\u201d the pink dino asked slickly, and Trish practically melted along his words.\r\n     Avoiding my gaze with a face like a stoplight, she mumbled, \u201cSh-shamrock Spire. It was a spire, you dunce.\u201d\r\n     \u201cAnd I was\u2026\u201d Reed choked on his tongue for a moment, letting out a small cough. \r\n     Maybe that was a carfe thing. I don\u2019t know.\r\n     \u201cI became Frazt, a fairy. I sensed your passions from across the ocean and nearly drowned to find you, but you both saved me.\r\n     \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to talk to kids until I met you. You guys took me under your wings. You\u2019d get into fights with kids and sneak into the P.E. shed to build forts. You were so cool. You didn\u2019t let anyone stop you.\r\n     \u201cPeople laughed at us for playing pretend for so long, and maybe we did\u2026 but we three, we shared something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\r\n     Like a spell, Trish and Reed\u2019s eyes welled. Their gazes locked together.\r\n     \u201cI can\u2019t resist what you and Fang do. There\u2019s a vibe of creativity you both ooze out. I don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d Reed laughed uneasily, \u201cbut I always looked forward to us playing again.\u201d\r\n     \u201cWhy are you saying all this, just to rile me up?\u201d Trish sniffled.\r\n     \u201cNo. We gotta keep playing, and if there\u2019s no new characters than we can\u2019t play anymore. You can\u2019t strap on a sword without a rope to cut or a brigand to duel. \r\n     \u201cAnon is a new player. He\u2019s bringing something new. He helped Fang while you were busy schem- planning and I was-\u201d\r\n     \u201c-Getting skunked.\u201d Trish finished.\r\n     Reed recoiled from the sting. \u201cYeah\u2026 Y\u2019know. Anon helped me a lot too. He grilled my ass good.\u201d\r\n     \u201cOh?\u201d Trish\u2019s saccharine countenance hardened like quick cement.\r\n     Reed\u2019s shades slid down the length of his snout even further, revealing a pair of confused eyes along with an uneasy smile. \u201cWeh?\u201d\r\n     \u201cFine. We can talk things out more\u2026 I thought Fang was joking, but I\u2019ve never seen you get so sappy over a dude.\u201d\r\n     \u201cWe\u2019re not fucking!\u201d Reed and I shouted in unison, but it only fed Trish\u2019s enormous ego."},"Pink Fuzz Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Reed And Reeda","Pink Fuzz Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"Pink Fuzz 3: Relapse\r\nSFW (Reed. Sad warning.)\r\n\r\n     Reed showed Anon a side of himself he showed nobody else. He gave speeches he thought he\u2019d never manage, ones he didn\u2019t know he needed to give. The feelings didn\u2019t come up until they did. Now he felt naked.\r\n     Things were easier when he made quips to shock and entertain the worry-addled minds around him, when he Bugs Bunny\u2019d dumb bimbos like Naomi into taking their bootlicking faces outta sight. \r\n     At least then he felt he was helping people by default: Reed, the goofy stoner, the coolest bro you could ask for\u2026 as long as you didn\u2019t ask for much.\r\n     It had been a month since Fang\u2019s rooftop fiasco. Reed said so much then, but knew he didn\u2019t live up to the standard. \r\n     He had a lot of time to think about this, especially after tuning out most of Trish\u2019s harebrained schemes for the concert. All he remembered was Fang and Anon (that lucky devil), scored a venue at Dino-Moe\u2019s Pizzeria.\r\n     It\u2019d feel weird seeing a high-profile client outside strict business, but he\u2019d manage. \r\n     \u201cIt\u2019ll be sweet. You and Fang will sync up your strings and jam out. Sound\u2019ll bounce off the walls with a venue that small.\u201d Reed said, interrupting Trish\u2019s worrying over a t-shirt booth or something. He wasn\u2019t listening and didn\u2019t want to wait until getting called out on it.\r\n     \u201cTch. You actually think it\u2019ll work out for us?\u201d Trish replied.\r\n     \u201cSure will. Ever been to The Sewer?\u201d\r\n     \u201cNot old enough to barhop, Reed.\u201d\r\n     \u201cOkay but\u2026 small venues make us louder. This kind of stuff makes noise punk tolerable. It\u2019ll go great.\u201d\r\n     It was quiet in the auditorium without Fang and Anon\u2019s cooing. This also forced Trish to unload her cheap t-shirt ideas entirely onto him.\r\n     Still, tender moments did come, and it made life worth living:\r\n     \u201cWe\u2019re doing this to help Fang too, right? We can\u2019t let Anon do all the work.\u201d Trish said and tried to chuckle, but her bitterness toward the latter still leaked from her clenched teeth.\r\n     \u201cHuh? Oh yeah, of course. Fang deserves the best.\u201d Reed said, or at least something with his voice spoke for him. His nervous system buzzed so harshly he felt like a pair of eyeballs attached to a floating brainstem. Maybe it was old instincts that kept his eyes on the prize: Mr. Jingo\u2019s plush chair\u2026\r\n\t\r\n     Later that evening, Reed shuffled out of the chem lab. He slid a spare key into his pockets. Everyone from IT to bio knew the drill when the dingy dromaeosaur came around.\r\n     He held a mound of a strange, crystalline substance bundled in a sheet of paper. He carried it like a toddler made of stained glass.\r\n     This was a knockoff thermite recipe he found online years ago. After baking the ingredients, one had thirty minutes to place it before the mixture hardened. After that, any movement or fluctuation in heat would activate a screaming white light that\u2019d eat through concrete.\r\n     A pit of worry welled in his stomach as he gently tucked the substance onto the lock of the auditorium's back door (out of sight from the streets or nearby neighborhoods). This wasn\u2019t just because he was transferring explosives like a fresh pastry, but because he needed to blow his way into the auditorium just to feel something plush beneath his ass.\r\n     Anon\u2019s apartment, Skin Row. Reed still couldn\u2019t believe he got kicked out of there. It was his own fault. He got too sloppy. After that beat down, he invited clients over while Anon was out. They even \u2018tested\u2019 product together. It was more than just carfe, too\u2026\r\n     Anon\u2019s humble neet den became a flop-house, with walls tinged with numerous copulations of pipe-smoked fancies. Ever since then, Reed kept to motels, back alleys, and a pocket full of sudafed.\r\n     The humans were still looking for him and his loving family froze his bank account. He hadn\u2019t been home at all since Anon visited.\r\n     He didn\u2019t even want to think about his Creamcast\u2026 or Killer\u2019s Heaven\u2026\r\n     His funds dwindling and mind wandering from cutting into so much of his own supply, sometimes spiders crept in the corners of his vision, and he heard the voices of his friends say terrible things about him as if he wasn\u2019t there:\r\n     \u201cCan\u2019t depend on him at all.\u201d\r\n     \u201cReed\u2019s\u2026 well, Reed.\u201d\r\n     \u201cHe\u2019s just a weed, a stepping stone to my success.\u201d\r\n     That last bit voiced itself through both Anon and Fang.\r\n     After the thermite did its work, Reed kicked the door down and was greeted with a backdraft of plastic and varnished woodwind instruments. He floated through this palace of memories like a spectre, unable to hear his own footsteps as figures loomed in the dark, hiding behind monoliths of sheet music stands and towers of plastic chairs.\r\n     His breath halted in his chest as he approached Mr. Jingo\u2019s prized chair. It was a plush, Swedish high modern something-or-other, pink and egg-shaped like a womb.\r\n     Reed trembled as he peeled off the green longcoat he stole from a laundromat. He\u2019d gained a few more welts from sleeping in the wrong neighborhood park a week back, and he didn\u2019t know using his arm as a pillow on concrete would make him scab up so bad.\r\n     It was so pleasantly dark he didn\u2019t have to look at what he became. His slouch became less of a relaxed mannerism and moreso a circumstance of weak, jelly-like limbs and a burnt out motor skills. \r\n     He collapsed so hard into the chair that the cushions enveloped him. For the first time in ages, something soft wrapped itself around him.\r\n     He tossed his stimulants into the trash and took advantage of this hangover to close his eyes.\r\n     He could afford a few hours of sleep\u2026\r\n     Hot streams poured down his cheeks, but he couldn\u2019t hear himself cry.\r\n\r\n     Seven days until VVURM DRAMA plays. He only remembered this because Trish and Fang mentioned it constantly. The few times his friends looked to him he managed a half-lidded grin, but he didn\u2019t feel anything about it. He didn\u2019t even feel alive anymore. Anon wouldn\u2019t even look at him.\r\n     The gang buzzed around him like little beings of energy and he fed off it by approximation until lunch ended. Unsatisfied with himself, he skipped class to roam the halls.\r\n     Were palm trees always this big? He thought. What about these vines? They\u2019re everywhere! The humidity and oxygen levels are crazy here. He then looked to a crowd of fellow dinos as the school counsel introduced a gaggle of kids to the campus. \r\n     \u201cWe\u2019re all like, cereal mascots. Raptor Jesus, all these colors burn. What, do we live in a cartoon?\u201d he asked, his voice rattling wearily.\r\n     \u201cReed? Is that you? What are you talking about.\u201d a familiar voice replied, one so ominous it froze him in terror and left his mouth agape.\r\n     The orchid oppressor, the marmalade maestro, the apricot abjudicator: Naomi. \r\n     He thought he was talking to Fang, which just went to show how fucked up his head got.\r\n     \u201cYou look homeless. Are you going for a Kurt Cobain look? It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to introduce kids to Gus Van Sant this early\u2026-\u201d she babbled.\r\n     \u201cUmmm. I don\u2019t speak French,\u201d was all Reed could come up with when it came to misdirection.\r\n     Naomi\u2019s eyes intensified from behind her housewife-like cat glasses, staring right through him. \r\n     \u201cWhatever.\u201d she said. For once, she didn\u2019t feel like playing hall monitor, and curtly turned away. Her narrow hips in those high riding mom jeans swayed like a metronome, headed off to whatever bootlicking endeavor buzzed in her robotic brain.\r\n     It was surely Reed\u2019s least confident comeback, one that even made Naomi realize he wasn\u2019t worth the time. \r\n     He wasn\u2019t sure how to feel about that.\r\n\r\n     Trish corralled Reed after school into coming for rehearsal. She pushed him like a mule to make him remember where they were walking. \r\n     \u201cCome on. It\u2019s not like you have anything better to do,\u201d she huffed. \r\n     Of course they would need him to ready the electronics, and while Anon seemed more friendly to him again he did his best to keep out of everyone\u2019s way. He kept his jacket tight over himself despite the heat, and hid his usually vibrant aquamarine eyes behind the shield shades he snagged from a shop a bit ago.\r\n     Since technical work was the bane of most, he had guaranteed time alone. He knew he had to do something with the lights and amps, something about syncing them to the patterns of their songs, but he mainly fucked around with switchboards and feigned activity.\r\n     He couldn\u2019t pay attention even if he wanted to. His mind was playing silver screen flicks of horrible memories, gripping his mind like a devil\u2019s claw:\r\n     \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be retarded forever! Skinnies used to poison each other in war with this stuff!\u201d the laughs of Rhine, his chickenshit older step-brother, played loudly. Working in the nooks and crannies behind the stage, it reminded him of the gardening shed they (Rhine and dear old step-dad) locked him in after getting his first honors certificate. \r\n     They told him it was man time, and that certain skinnies forced children to inhale the fumes of hallucinogenic datura for a \u2018vision quest\u2019.\r\n     He remembered scratching his claws off against the plastic door of the shed, which was barred from the other side. He cried his eyes out and called for dad, his real dad, but purple smoke burrowed into his lungs in response.\r\n     Only after the trauma did he realize the average datura trip lasted for three days, and that one could survive to the very end and still die from complications. Datura, even the most common trumpet flower, had greatly variable strength from flower to flower.\r\n     He doubted Rhine thought of that when he invited friends over to take bongloads and laugh at him.\r\n     Would they care if he died, or even panic?\r\n     What would his tombstone look like?\r\n     Reed decided that his headstone would bear his real name (before his gold-trigger mom changed it) and the following epitaph:\r\n     Marcus Streiland. \u201cAnother sad story.\u201d\r\n     \u201cAre you finished already!?\u201d Fang\u2019s voice awoke Reed from a replay of the nightmare world he called a childhood.\r\n     He was on the floor, looking up to the chins of his friends. They grimaced at him like he was a stain, with a mix of confusion, anger, and worry distributed between them in random amounts.\r\n     \u201cUhm. Yeah. Good to go!\u201d he rattled uneasily, and smiled.\r\n\r\n     The harsh claxons of the fire alarm forced Reed to cover his pounding ears with his arms.\r\n     A firetruck drew the rubbernecking of students passing by, who were shooed away and told to go back to class. \r\n     No one was injured, thankfully, but over twelve-hundred dollars of stage lights were ruined in what the head IT guy agreed was the worst case of switchbox jigsaw in school history.\r\n     Anon and Fang and Trish didn\u2019t stick around after the sparks rained on them. Their enthusiasm transformed into fear the second they flipped that switch\u2026\r\n     \u201cOnly six days until the concert!\u201d Fang panicked.\r\n     \u201cWe can do it without him. Moe has good people.\u201d Anon assured them.\r\n     He couldn\u2019t bear to look at them, and simply sat in the office\u2019s grilling chair to sponge reprimands from the IT and Principal Spears. That hulk of a man nearly tore his head off.\r\n     Of course, Reed accepted all the blame, and by the time he was told to leave the sun was setting and no one waited for him outside. He knew this, so while Naomi positioned herself to shoo him out like a bum from a storefront, he shouldered past her and bolted back into the office. His legs were so weak each step threw him off balance. He bounded off the walls like a pinball as he barreled to the one place that could save him.\r\n     \u2018Anon is a new player. He\u2019s bringing something new. He helped Fang-.\u2019 \r\n     Who said that? Oh right, he did, and while the heads of suits swerved to catch the ragged, filthy, run down pinky raptor before them, he charged down the front door of the counselor\u2019s office.\r\n     His body gave out immediately, and he collapsed to the floor and cried. He drooled all over the carpet and held himself tight. The poor, confused ptero woman who signed up for this job took to her notepad frantically:\r\n\r\n     -Reed\u2019s father was killed in an underground electrical incident when      he was young.\r\n     -Left to abusive family.\r\n     --Highly abusive.\r\n     -Also hates father because he\u2019s a \u2018fed stooge\u2019 who let himself die to tinker over subjects instead of \u2018embracing sauranity\u2019.\r\n     -Obviously involved in criminal behavior (unstated).\r\n     -Unloved by anyone, despite wanting to support his friends.\r\n     -Too \u2018burnt out perma-retarded\u2019 to help them\u2026\r\n     -HOMELESS ADULT.\r\n\r\n     By break time, the hall was packed with students. It sounded like several bombs made of bottled screams went off in the school office. One student reported seeing Reed, rocking and shaking in a large blue dino-blankey, surrounded by the school counselor, some concerned faculty, and a security guard. \r\n     He stared into the colorful, smiling dinos spread across the blanket\u2019s design, wishing it was a vista he could dive into.\r\n     Reed was eighteen. He was a homeless adult. While things might\u2019ve been done to secure housing for students, he only had a few hundred dollars left to his name and it was doubtful his parents would help him.\r\n     In fact, due to numerous PTA meeting incidents, they were placed on the \u2018do not call\u2019 list.\r\n\r\n     I got to sit on Fang\u2019s lap, her skin like porcelain, as we gently plucked her guitar. Unlike my room, the window sat wide open, letting the drapes flutter with calming sea salt wind.\r\n     Aside from being on lookout for her father\u2019s car, everything was perfect again. \r\n     It seemed like we found each other right when everything was falling apart. We jumped from the crumbling platforms of our crappy, neglected loner lives and made something for ourselves.\r\n     Even if this is the crest - our happiest moment together - I\u2019d be okay with that.\r\n     Our reverie was broken when Fang\u2019s cell rang. I pretended not to pay attention, but several stern voices spoke to her from the other line.\r\n     \u201cCan he stay at my house?\u201d Fang restated, and then very quickly replied, \u201cNo. My parents would kill me. There\u2019s no way they\u2019d-. Yes. Alright. No problem. Bye.\u201d\r\n     Fang\u2019s glowing ease transformed into anxiety in an instant. Her eyes paced across the room, but focused on me. Her limbs squeezed tighter around me for support.\r\n     \u201cI think Reed\u2019s at his limit\u2026\u201d\r\n     \u201cHm?\u201d I replied.\r\n     \u201cHe broke down. It sounds really bad.\u201d\r\n     \u201cHe seemed fine a month ago. I\u2026 don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d\r\n     Fang nodded. Her eyes strained until crows feet sprouted beneath them.\r\n     For a stoner, Reed seemed fine when I first met him. I wasn\u2019t sure if his behavioral issues made him swing into huge bouts of junkiness, but it stressed out everyone around him. \r\n     No wonder Fang was so insecure.\r\n     \u201cHe\u2019s been homeless for a while now. He didn\u2019t even tell me.\u201d\r\n     My body tensed at that. \r\n     Did he really not have a place to go after I threw him out? This can\u2019t be my fault. He pushed this himself. He let four crusty dudes blow hookah on my bed. There are still coal stains on the mattress! \r\n     \u201cW-why won\u2019t he tell me anything? He won\u2019t let me in\u2026\u201d Fang whimpered, and set her guitar aside, too frazzled to play.\r\n     He taped the fire alarm too. My landlord found it and I got fined five-hundred bones. My parents were so pissed\u2026\r\n     \u201cIs this our fault? I should\u2019ve asked about those jackets\u2026 The nurse said he was covered with scabs.\u201d\r\n     I know that was jizz. He let someone jizz on my wall.\r\n     That tears it.\r\n     \u201cNo! I mean, it\u2019s not your fault. He said he wanted to help, but he got himself into a ton of trouble. The guy can barely see straight.\u201d\r\n     \u201cAre you saying I should just give up on him!?\u201d Fang snarled as if I called her a waste of time too.\r\n     Maybe that\u2019s how close they were, or maybe she just thought she was like him: an outcast.\r\n     \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between you and Reed. Reed\u2026 his home life is horrible. His family all compress drug crystals or something. Their place could go out like a pressure cooker.\u201d\r\n     This only dug Fang\u2019s face deeper into my chest, as if to muffle herself away from the pain, but I gently part a silky, silvery bang of her mane and she looked up to me, her massive eyes pleading.\r\n     \u201cReed has a lot of problems. So do we. We can\u2019t\u2026 dedicate all our sympathy points to him.\u201d\r\n     Fang\u2019s eyes suddenly narrowed. Her voice lowered back to its usual punky self. \u201cSympathy points?\u201d she asked.\r\n     Fuck fuck I referenced TableQuest aloud!\r\n     \u201cSympathy is a resource. If you\u2019re feeling down, you have to invest that much more sympathy into yourself. If you give all your sympathy points away you\u2019ll burn out and they\u2019ll want more from you. Nobody wins.\u201d\r\n     \u201cReed isn\u2019t an emotional vampire, you cock sock! He\u2019s-!\u201d\r\n     \u201cHe let someone cum on my wall! You can\u2019t help someone when they do that!\u201d\r\n     In a split second, my pure white pterosaur dug her palms into my chest. She planted herself firmly on my stomach, pinning me to the bed.\r\n     \u201cYou said you went to his house before,\u201d her voice was unshakable and low, like a chiding mother who caught her son smearing shit on the walls. The way her muzzle pulled back into baring fangs and muscle was the most terrifyingly arousing thing I\u2019d ever seen.\r\n     \u201cTell me everything. Now.\u201d she growled."},"Pink Fuzz Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Reed And Reeda","Pink Fuzz Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"Pink Fuzz 4: Final Rondo\r\nNSFW (Trish and Reed)\r\n\r\n     Trish\u2019s duplex was small, but lively. Reed suspected her mother was a nurse: rarely present and always exhausted. The numerous shelves and bookcases in the living room were lined with rhinestones and assorted fantastic figurines depicting unicorns, goat men, the works\u2026 It was the perfect representation of someone coping with a harsh job, someone seeking escape.\r\n     As Trish hoisted him through the house, he realized why she worked so hard to find success.\r\n     After thanking her mom for the ride, Trish strained and groaned as she hauled the jelly-legged raptor junkie into her garage, where they could be alone for the rebuilding process.\r\n     The garage was lined with everything from a workbench, to spare lumber, to spray paint, to a bundle of old tractor tires. You name it.\r\n     \u201cNo wonder you always get plans going. That\u2019s like, an Ed, Edd n Eddy thing.\u201d Reed chuckled, but his voice was hoarse after hours of unloading on the counselor, crying, and trying to fight off security guards in bouts of paranoia.\r\n     \u201cWhy? You said you were a fairyboy. I thought you were better than this\u2026\u201d Trish replied shakily.\r\n     Reed clenched his teeth with worry. \u201cI- I\u2019ll make it up to you. It\u2019s just been really rough at h-.\u201d\r\n     \u201cI heard. I couldn\u2019t hear enough of it. Anon? You went to his place too? You could\u2019ve come here at any time. Did you even think about that, you fucking idiot?\u201d\r\n     He didn\u2019t\r\n     \u201cS-sorry, bro,\u201d he squeaked. \u201cI\u2019ll find us another venue to jam out at.\u201d \r\n     The glare Trish issued made him shrink back in his dino blankey, nearly mummifying himself.\r\n     \u201cYou\u2019re going to play at Dino-Moe\u2019s. I\u2019m going to be your rehab coach. I plotted a regiment with mom and everything,\u201d Trish stated flatly.\r\n     Reed\u2019s eye peeked out from the blanket. When did she change into that Tapout sweater, and where did she get that hose from? He thought.\r\n     The tiny triceratops flicked a switch and a pressure washer hummed to life. The hose already fed into it. Her gaunt fingers wrapped tightly around the nozzle and twisted until her knuckles went white.\r\n     FWSSSHT FWSSHT! She gave an experimental pull on the trigger, and a perfect white beam of water shot out.\r\n     \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s low pressure. It won\u2019t leave bruises.\u201d Trish said.\r\n     FWWWWSSSHHHT!!\r\n     \u201cAW FUCK NOT COOL!\u201d\r\n     FWWWWSSSHHHT!!\r\n     \u201cTIMEOUTTIMEOUT!\u201d\r\n     Reed\u2019s shrieks resounded through the quiet neighborhood that day, and Trish made sure it would stay this way until five days pass, until the concert.\r\n     The pink raptor, dressed in nothing but an oversized D.A.R.E. shirt, wheezed and wobbled as he took to the tire run Trish assembled in her backyard. Trish\u2019s mother sat on the porch nearby, filling an ashtray like nobody\u2019s business and reading through a harlequin novel.\r\n     Those massive tractor tires became Reed\u2019s first enemy. He already left several face prints against the vinyl fence as his large legs gave out and tripped him over and over again.\r\n     His body flashed hot and cold simultaneously. His mind went blank. His jaw hung open as he gaped for air constantly, drooling like an animal.\r\n     His foot caught the horrid mouth of a tire again and he collapsed. His fall was cushioned by the obstacle course like an angel\u2019s kiss, and he sprawled his nude body across them. He didn\u2019t give a single shit at this point as his junk hung out.\r\n     He didn\u2019t flinch this time when Trish blew her whistle. \u201cTen seconds of rest. Just finish a few more sets and then we move to the strength exercises.\u201d\r\n     Reed gasped. His chest heaved up and down. His bruised, battered peach body glowed once again in the daytime sun. A golden silhouette accentuated his body, thanks to the mist from numerous hosings.\r\n     Reed whined and gasped, unable to form words.\r\n     \u201cNo backtalk. You\u2019re not going to die. I looked this up.\u201d\r\n     Trish\u2019s mother nodded sagely, and watched intently as Trish delivered another perfect beam of water into his exposed tailhole.\r\n     \u201cMAXIMALLY UNCOOL! RANCID CUNT FUUUCK!\u201d Reed shrieked.\r\n     Eventually, the noise complaints stopped coming. Reed learned the hard way that whatever horrid, horrid experiments Trish ran were always tolerated by sheer bullheaded triggerity.\r\n     This wasn\u2019t all pain for Reed. He was given the finest handmade meals he\u2019d ever had. Wonderous bowls of meat, veggies, and fruit showed themselves to him steamed, grilled, raw; it all tasted great and filled him with a vigor neither his parents or cafeteria food ever gave him. \r\n     He teared up with joy and scarfed down a bowl of jambalaya.\r\n     As usual, Trish stood behind him with a whistle around her neck and the hose in her hand. Even against her purple scales, her eyes were dark and baggy with exhaustion.\r\n     Still, she cracked a smile every now and again. \u201cYou look like Inafune when you do that, savoring every meal after a long journey.\u201d\r\n     \u201cYou captured my family? Let them die! I hate all of them!\u201d he growled between tearing chunks of steamy chicken and sausage between the sets of daggers he called teeth. \r\n     He quoted the Musashi film, and elicited a chuckle from Trish, but they both knew he meant this in sincerity as well; in this real world where he\u2019d be aptly branded a deadbeat.\r\n     Silence washed over them. All the pushups and squats and tire runs really made his scales and feathers glow. His humor seemed to come back as well, but there was a long way to go.\r\n     \u201cWe can\u2019t do this forever, you know? And there\u2019s a pile of homework waiting for you.\u201d\r\n     Hunched over his food like an animal, Reed let bits of fried rice tumble down his muzzle and onto the garage floor. He belched hotly and sighed.\r\n     \u201cI know. Th-thanks for everything, Trish. You\u2019ve been a real bro, and I mean a real one.\u201d\r\n     The tire suddenly creaked as Trish sat down next to him. Her plush thigh indented against his toned leg like memory foam.\r\n     Reed\u2019s raw muscles stung like hundreds of hot wires. He bit back a yelp.\r\n     Trish winced from his pain and tried to scoot away to give him space, but Reed\u2019s massive tail, like a palm tree of pink, gently wrapped around her waist, and pulled her closer.\r\n     \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll pull through. I\u2019ll be stronger, for myself and everyone. Even if Fang calls me a\u2026 weed.\u201d Reed said.\r\n     \u201cShe said that?\u201d Trish peeped.\r\n     \u201cWell, Anon said she said it\u2026\u201d\r\n     Trish\u2019s brow furrowed.\r\n     \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d\r\n     \u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2026 It\u2019s just, are we losers?\u201d\r\n     The pair went silent.\r\n     \u201cFang was always the one with the talent. We\u2019ve just been hurting her. I still think about what you said, even though you exposed our cringe school games to that ape.\u201d Trish said.\r\n     \u201cWell, I could be wrong.\u201d\r\n     \u201cIf you\u2019re being aloof on purpose I\u2019ll get the hose\u2026\u201d Trish jumped bolt upright, but Reed\u2019s hands wrapped softly, but firmly around her shoulders. \r\n     \u201cDon\u2019t wash me out like an asylum patient again,\u201d he tried to speak coolly, but clenched with worry.\r\n     \u201cI just mean\u2026 Fang has her own stuff to deal with, and Anon makes her happy. When I see them together they\u2019re glowing, and it\u2019s not the carfe, I swear.\u201d\r\n     Trish eased down again, but grounded her bountiful, grape rump onto his lap. \r\n     Reed\u2019s face burned hot. It wasn\u2019t time to be a bro, but a man-saur, and he cradled her back and legs tenderly in his arms.\r\n     \u201cI\u2019ve slung deals with people all across town. I\u2019ve never sold to kids and I don\u2019t sell bunk product. I don\u2019t sell shitty hook drugs either. I think I even sold to the mob at some point.\r\n     \u201cEveryone, all this time, thought I was just goofing around. I really don\u2019t understand what any of them think of me anymore.\u201d\r\n     Trish stared up Reed wordlessly as he chuckled.\r\n     \u201cIsn\u2019t that fucking crazy? I could\u2019ve been an assassin. Like, a ninja or some sh-\u201d\r\n     A loud slap rang through Reed\u2019s skull. Trish delivered a small, but powerful palm print that burned against his gentle, pink scales like a branding iron.\r\n     \u201cYou idiot! You dopey cunt!\u201d\r\n     \u201cCrazy bitch! You controlling little tyrant! I can\u2019t believe I let you-\u201d\r\n     Mid-shout, Trish slammed her muzzle into his. Her supple lips cushioned against their unwieldy snoots as they crooked their necks until finding the perfect place to interlock.\r\n     They moaned hotly into each other\u2019s mouths as Reed worked his strong, raptorian tongue around hers. He gently bounced her on his lap, enjoying every movement. Their hands wrapped greedily around each other, grasping at any chunk of soft meat they could.\r\n     Reed thought they may be mismatched losers in unwieldy positions, but every correction made formed a dance of compensation, an attempt to please the other, but still be embraced. \r\n     They found themselves curled around each other, lodged into the tractor tire like coupled snakes. Trish\u2019s claws dug into his back, hips, and firm, peach backside while he tongue-banged her until she gasped.\r\n     Reed\u2019s junk grinded against his t-shirt. His sizable rod tented Mc\u2019Rex (the no drug dude)\u2019s face decal as he thrusted into the warm, all-enveloping force of her thighs. \r\n     Their passion filled the garage with heat, like a sauna of sweat. Their movements eventually softened, and they lapped each other\u2019s bodies like waves at low tide, rocking in perfect tandem. \r\n     Reed gently licked the ripe, blueberry mounds of Trish\u2019s bare breasts before collapsing on top of her.\r\n     \u201cAwwhn~. I wanna melt across your body like strawberry syrup. S-so hot. Tired. You\u2019re working me to death,\u201d Reed groaned.\r\n     Trish grunted. She tried to push the limp post-stoner off, and wriggled with all her strength, but it only got her aroused again. \r\n     Still basking in the afterglow of the furious makeout, she wasn\u2019t too mad.\r\n\r\n     Time passed, and before they knew it they rushed through homework sheets while getting a ride from Trish\u2019s mom. Eventually, They got to Moe\u2019s before Fang or Anon. They stumbled occasionally and, thanks to Reed, both adorned massive shades to cover the social black holes surrounding their eyes. However, they laughed lively, and joked about old movies as they worked the wiring arrangements and set up Trish\u2019s makeshift t-shirt stand.\r\n     Reed still thought spray painted shirts were cheap, faux-punk garbo, but he didn\u2019t have the heart to say it. He didn\u2019t wanna get gored after surviving the rehab concentration camp\u2026\r\n     Anon, Fang, Stella, Rosa, and plenty of randos funneled into Dino-Moe\u2019s. The soft, yellow lights of the restaurant played across the soothing latticework, coating everyone with a groovy cross-section pattern. Despite the size of the venue, the place was managed well with few walls between everyone. Reed finally felt he was alive again, and he breathed easy. He was swept into conversation with friends, and in the high of reacquainting with everyone, agreed to watched some show called Chobits.\r\n     Without carfe, Reed felt the weight of anxiety build throughout the venue as they neared showtime.\r\n     \u201cCig break. I\u2019ll be right back, boss.\u201d Reed said.\r\n     Trish smiled and shot finger guns at him.\r\n     Fang had the same idea, Reed found, and he saw her leaning against the brickwork out back. Her eyes glanced to his. She grinned, and crunched the menthol bead between her teeth.\r\n     Reed slapped a fresh package of Raptorian Spirits, making sure the tobacco was freshly packed into the end of each cig.\r\n     \u201cBurping the babies.\u201d He said jovially, and leaned on the wall beside her. He ripped open the package with a swift pull against his teeth and offered one to the frontliner.\r\n     Wordlessly, she handed him a menthol.\r\n     They shared each other\u2019s flavors, two cigs in each mouth, and watched the sun set over the vast bazaar of Troodon Town.\r\n     \u201cHey, Trish.\u201d Anon said from the backroom, the open window carrying his voice to Reed\u2019s ear. \u201cYou sure this outlet\u2019s right? The cables look like a mess.\u201d\r\n     Reed suddenly doubted himself. He felt crusty again in a flash that made his lip twitch. The menthol fell out from his maw, but he snatched it back, mid fall.\r\n     \u201cNice.\u201d Fang said.\r\n     For that moment, he remembered the hellworld he lived in only a week ago. No, all up until this point - shithead family included. \r\n     His lazy lids and dashing eyelashes swept toward Fang. He popped the cig back in and puffed small rings before smiling.\r\n     \u201cEy. I don\u2019t think I told you about this, but you and Anon are fuckin\u2019 in-sync.\r\n     \u201cAlso\u2026 sorry I almost killed everyone back when,\u201d he added sheepishly.\r\n     \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said you were a weed.\u201d Fang said.\r\n     \u201cHm?\u201d Reed replied, feigning ignorance, but the grin spreading across his cheeks gave him away.\r\n     Fang elbowed him in the side. He hoped the exercise would force her to revel at his hardened abs, but he was still raw from rigorous daily training, and his muscles didn\u2019t have a chance to recoup yet.\r\n     Reed bit back a howl.\r\n     \u201cAnon\u2019s a dweeb. I know he told you. I didn\u2019t mean it. I was\u2026-\u201d\r\n     \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019ve lived with being pissy and confused longer than I have. Shoot me some pointers sometime.\u201d\r\n     That earned him another elbow. His knees buckled under the pain.\r\n     \u201cAugh! Dammit!\u201d He hissed between bouts of laughter.\r\n     \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Fang asked.\r\n     From this point on the ground, Reed saw the flickers of thousands of lights, like fireflies flitting about the marketplace. All of them were aimless and confused. They smiled genuinely or trained themselves to smile. Some pursued shit they didn\u2019t need just for a taste of the former. Young lights become old lights and bright lights dulled before his eyes.

They always fucked up the typeset and got their work out late. No one read the stuff, either. It was all fedshit or idpol crap or clique talk, but Reed tolerated this issue because they were featured, somewhere.\r\n     That, and Trish read it on his lap, smothering him in bountiful booty once again.\r\n     \u201cHere we are!\u201d she squealed and her eyes shined, but she suddenly went quiet.\r\n     \u201cWoah, hey there! Aw man\u2026\u201d Reed followed her example, and facepalmed.\r\n     In the far corner of the music section, VVURM DRAMA had a glowing review:\r\n     \u201cA perfect post-ironic embrace of buttrock with a nowave edge and lyrics that defy structure. VVURM DRAMA finally embracing a guitarist milked sweet melodies from their group that no one expected before.\r\n     \u201cMost importantly, the band members' clashing ensembles belies their synchronicity. It\u2019d be hard to draw comparisons, especially when the bassist and drummer were tighter on each other than birds to an herbivore. Their matching, sweat-soaked casualware resembled the aftermath of a landmine in a stoner\u2019s bedroom, and their sunglasses looked like the Blues Brothers after getting stomped by a mammoth a few hundred times.\r\n     \u201cYou had to be there to dig it. The moshpit was intense! Shoutout to Stella. Sorry for stepping on your face.\u201d\r\n\tYours truly, \r\n\t     Anpterasaur Fantano\r\n\r\n     \u201cWe look retarded.\u201d Trish groaned.\r\n     Even in a black and white photograph, Trish and Reed\u2019s expressions were perfectly immortalized: their bodies swung helplessly their respective pluck and thump. Their mouths hung wide open, with what looked like a perfect string of spit flying from Reed\u2019s maw. \r\n     \u201cThat\u2019s like, a one-in-a-million shot. The light had to be perfect. That\u2019s my spit! Rock on!\u201d\r\n     \u201cCome on!\u201d Trish whined, and she pounded herself into his junk in protest."},"Reeda And Anon Brojob It Up!.txta":{"path":["Reed And Reeda","Reeda And Anon Brojob It Up!.txta"],"text":"Title: Reeda And Anon Brojob It Up!\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Reeda, Trish, Anon\nRating: Semi-NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n> Hanging out with my best bro Reeda!\n> Drinking beer and smoking joints in her parent's basement\n> Playing Rock Ring 2 in my apartment until she falls asleep on my shoulder\n> Holding her hair back and tucking her into bed when she drinks too much at a party\n> Lounging in the grass, smoking weed, and watching the stars after we got kicked out of her parent's house\n> \"Ha ha, man...

From her vibrant pink scales and wild mane to her tattered, loosely fit clothing -- jeans with holes torn from every over-extension of her lean, but sizable hips and the sleeveless, side-less remains of an old Warped Tour t-shirt (back when that stuff actually mattered) -- one would expect a laid-back attitude with glimmers of perceptiveness used to wash over sorrows with absurdist gags and dude-isms.\n\nYou could tell her she practically wore a loin-cloth over her modest chest, and that it didn\u2019t even do its job well, and this pink raptor in question, Reeda, would just tell you to keep your eyes peeled, and guarantee there\u2019s better things to spot.\n\nFor the past few weeks, all that\u2019s gone through the wringer.\n\nReeda quit carfentanyl, which meant giving up hordes of associates and a potential vocation.\n\nShe was tired of sleepless nights from waiting for highs to burn out, tired of the contradictions of tranquilizers getting her giddy and uppers wearing her down. She was tired of sharing boofs with strangers, buyers, and the aforementioned \u2018friends\u2019 who now blew up her phone with temptations or demands of her services:\n\u201cdude what am i supposed to do without your jurassic park slamdown?\u201d\n\u201cthe city\u2019s stuck with schwag and mids without you.\u201d\n\u201cr u fuckin with me on purpos?\u201d\n\u201ctwiggy bitch\u201d\n\nWith a decisive clacking of her manicured claw, she blocked yet another number.\n\n\u201cHey, Reeda,\u201d Fang\u2019s confident, velvety voice broke through her mental fog.\n\n\u201cWhassup?\u201d she replied, taking Fang\u2019s hand and using her tail like a carjack to peel herself off the auditorium bleachers.\n \nShe tried to grin in her token glowing, carefree way, but it didn\u2019t come out right. \n\nHer friend\u2019s palm was the only warmth she felt in ages. It momentarily distracted her from the stark chill of the real world she had to face: no carfe, no schmoozing her way into rides and couches to crash on, and worst of all, no pockets full of cash.\n\n\u201cYou still feel-?\u201d Fang started.\n\u201cUseless. Kinda. Yeah\u2026\u201d Reeda replied.\n\u201cTrish should\u2019t\u2019ve said that crap. It\u2019s like she expected the venue to pay for itself, or you to pay for us.\u201d\n\nNoticing the pink raptor hanging from her grip, she bided her next words, but it was hard to gauge Reeda\u2019s expression. Even with her bandanna on, a mound of downy feather-hair hung over her face, revealing nothing but the spiny crags of cowlicks. Where were her enviable, voluminous lashes and glowing aquamarine gaze complete with the \u2018naturally\u2019 dark eyelids a past-time in carfe gets y-?\n\nOh right, the carfe\u2026\n\n\u201cNo one thought a bunch of stoners would boycott you. If anything, we should worry they\u2019re a big enough part of our fanbase to dent ticket sales.\u201d Fang said, grumbling the last bit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool.\u201d Reeda said numbly. \u201cI-\u201d\n\nHer words caught in her throat. She felt for them with rolls of her tongue, and if she could tongue her brain she\u2019d look there too, but only uncool, un-chill things came to mind:\n\u2018It\u2019s like the world wants me to be high forever.\u2019 \n\u2018How am I supposed to quit when I get all this cool shit?\u2019 \n\u2018I\u2019m a dopey idiot. I should buy clown shoes and wear them over my snout\u2026\u2019\n\u2018I had it so easy before, but it wasn\u2019t easy. It hurt. I\u2019m tired of neurotic losers talking sideways at everyone and everything. You skip out on a single favor and they say you\u2019re insane and broken, and they\u2019ll recall every contradiction you\u2019ve made and blow it out of proportion, all with a confused smile.\n\u2018I was scared at any time they\u2019d take more sleeping pics. They hid all their blankets in the crawlspace, so I smoked four bowls just to stay warm for the night. Their cameras flashed and I was sprawled across the couch like a doll.\u2019\n\nShe wanted to say any of these things, but an uneasy beating in her chest told her it wouldn\u2019t matter, that most saurs, especially Fang, had enough to deal with. Any complaints would only bum her out, and for what? Feelings ebb and flow, inner bro.\n \nYou\u2019d feel fine or shitty eventually, so why talk about it?\n\nReeda pounced at Fang and hugged her tight.\n\n\u201cWh-woah! Easy!\u201d the white ptero flared her wings to dampen the knock back, saving them from tumbling over a row of benches and down an ample flight more.\n\nReeda buried herself at the side of Fang\u2019s smooth neck. Her massive feather duster of a tail worked around her waist. Fang reciprocated by wrapping her wings around the both of them, enveloping her dreary friend in downy white.\n\n\u201cYou almost killed us, you dweeb. You\u2019re-\u201d\n\u2018-usually good at not tripping up,\u2019 was what she nearly said, but it\u2019d be the last thing Reeda\u2019d want to hear, in any context.\n\u201cTake some time off the band.\u201d she cooed in a way that melted the pink raptor\u2019s heart. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of Trish,\u201d she added, although dreading the prospect.\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll still get some lyrics out. If that\u2019s okay.\u201d Reeda\u2019s voice trembled.\n\n--\n\nReeda took things easy, as her frontliner ordered. She\u2019d spend her free time wandering around, as if getting reacquainted with her body, until she found herself attending gardening club after school. \n\nMaybe it was something to do with the sun, or the smooth-but-stern melody of Rosa\u2019s voice, but she worked the earth with her hands.\n\nIt was hypnotic. \n\nDamp, black potting soil and bits of perlite trickled over fresh seedlings, and loud arrangements of roses and azaleas and even \u2018filler plants\u2019 (Rosa\u2019s words) like morning glories overloaded her eyes with sensuality until they watered.\n\nShe rocked the apron-and-gloves combo, too, or so she thought.\n\nA quiet, dainty voice suddenly lapped her ears like a soft wave at the beachfront, \u201cReeda. Hey. I didn\u2019t know you helped the garden too?\u201d\n\nThe former stonersaurus plucked her head from the clouds long enough to take notice of the lime stego before her. \tIt was Stella, of course.\n\nFrom her squatting position, she couldn\u2019t help but eye up her soft features: that wide, curved snout\u2026 or the way her indoor-lifestyle blessed her with a waist that burgeoned into supple legs and a caboose sturdy enough to support a behemoth of a tail.\n\n\u201cAre you busy?\u201d Stella asked, this time more nervously.\n\nReeda snapped to attention, for real this time, after noticing how those bare legs grinded together squeamishly.\n\n\u201cSorry, bro!\u201d Reeda chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot on my mind lately.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell.\u201d Stella said softly. \u201cYou planted the seedlings upside down.\u201d\n\nFuck fuck fuck! \n\nReed\u2019s brain flooded with panic. Against all urges to stay willfully ignorant, she looked down. \n\nAny sign of stems and leaves were smothered, non-existent.\n\nSo much for her lengthy self-education in botany.\n\nThe stego kneeled right next to Reeda, both hurrying to salvage the crop before a certain latina longsword descended on them.\n\n--\n\nStella claimed this situation paralleled perfectly with a metaphor in one of the animes she watched all the time. \n\nReeda was thankful they recovered the seedlings and stayed partnered for the afternoon. She did her best to listen respectfully, but found herself drifting.\n\nShe felt guilty for not knowing Stella too well, but she didn\u2019t exactly mesh with the saurs near skin row\u2026 But those were old stomping grounds now.\n\nAs Stella talked about kids piloting their mothers and thermal expansion, or something, Reeda decided there was a playful exuberance to her, the way she seemed polite and sensitive, but was passionate about what she enjoyed.\n\n\u201cI remember when the entire cast bounced their naked bodies toward the screen -- a PoV shot, of course -- and told him to be one with them. My grandma walked in and I got grounded for-.\u201d\n\nRelentlessly passionate.\n--\n\nAfter Reeda mentioned she used to watch OVAs with a couch surfer a while back, Stella seemed keen to have her over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me and my grandma. It\u2019d be really nice to have you visit. I\u2019d love to show you some of my collection. It\u2019d only take a weekend.\u201d\n\nSweet Raptor Jesus. That tenderness. Reeda thought.\n \nStella was so primed to express herself, but did anyone really take her up on it? No. Not even Anon, and that guy was chill to everything, even with those anxious scruples wriggling inside him.\n\nReeda wondered how often she was there for her friends. She used to think she knew the whole town, but that went out with the carfe habit. \n\nAnd even with how sweetly Fang treated her, Reeda was still shocked when hearing about her preening issue on the school roof.\n\nIt rattled her to think she missed so much, but a five-speed manual transmission packed into a fatass brick van, her astro, didn\u2019t care for emotional issues.\n\nAnd mid-town traffic got vicious this time of day.\n\n\u201cAh.  Um. Turn left.\u201d Stella peeped, and braced her feet against the door frame to survive Reeda\u2019s power steer through  a five-way intersection.\n\nWhen the van rocked back onto all four wheels, Stella whimpered as she landed right onto Reeda\u2019s smooth, but firm lap. The e-brake stood like a pungee, just inches away from her face.\n\n\u201cAwh man. Sorry about the broken seatbelt. I dunno who used it to practice sailor knots. It\u2019s a bummer no one told me before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI- I meant to say right.\u201d Stella gurgled as if she\u2019d melt from fear at any moment.\n\n--\n\nSoft blue floral print lined the walls of Stella\u2019s apartment. It was a real oldie-dominated place, Reeda thought, given the constant machine-clicks of several grandfather clocks and shelves lined with ceramic toy figures.\n\n\u201cTheir eyes are following us,\u201d Reeda said and snickered, but Stella silenced her with a soft touch on her speartip of a snout.\n\n\u201cShhh. Wait \u2018til we get to my room.\u201d Stella whispered. \n\nReeda wondered what she got herself into. Would this weekend suck? Would she have to help change bedpans and be in bed before eight?\n\nThe raptor\u2019s opinion one-eightied once they entered Stella\u2019s room. Call it hypocrisy: the decor was still as homely as a haunted mansion in the countryside and toys still lined the walls\u2026 \n\nBut these toys were giants robots and naked women.\n\nThis was objectively much cooler.\n\nStella\u2019s den was shut-in certified. A backup stock of cookies and tea were in arm\u2019s distance at all times.\n\nReeda enjoyed a soggy mix of both, her legs kicking lazily as they hang off the stego\u2019s bed.\n \nStella\u2019s fingers danced across DVD cases as she parsed through her collection. She paused for a moment and tapped the choker at her neck. Then, she quickly turned to her carnivorous companion.\n\nTheir eyes, both aquamarine, locked to each other. \n\nWithout breaking her gaze, she plucked a random case.\n\n\u201cPutting faith in fate, huh?\u201d Reeda chuckled, but her expression straightened as Stella tossed the case to her.\n\n\u201cFLCL?\u201d\n\nStella placed the DVD into an old gaming console planted herself tentatively beside her visitor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ll actually like this one. It\u2019s really relatable, but also surreal and pretty entrenched in the studio\u2019s production culture.\u201d\n\nReeda blinked. \u201cBro, I\u2019m fine with anything. If you don\u2019t feel right we can just change the watchies. No biggie.\u201d\n\nStella\u2019s face softened again. Her worries seem to fade.\n\n--\n\nReeda\u2019s brain buzzed with electricity by the time the pop rock and live-action credits played. The show was short, but powerful, frenetic, and more visually arresting than most things she\u2019d ever seen. There was a universal sense of playful expertise as key animators inserted their own flairs into each scene.\n\t\nShe couldn\u2019t help but grasp at as many details as she could, listing them aloud before they drifted away just for the consolidation of sharing an experience with someone else.\n\nStella nodded knowingly, beaming with pride. Frankly, she was surprised Reeda even knew what key animation was. Then again, the woman was school whiz, and she always tended to smelly plants in the chem lab, so she had to be a polymath of some kind.\n\nStill, she had to seal the deal. She needed a read on Reeda.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your favorite girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cMinamori.\u201d Reeda replied without hesitation.\n\n\u201cA very theatric choice. I\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d Stella meeped and clapped softly.\n\n\u201cHow about you?\u201d Reeda asked coyly, but before Stella could provide a long, articulate reply about the struggles of Mamimi, something rested against her shoulder.\n\nA giant pink pom pom?!\nWait! No! That\u2019s Reeda\u2019s head, and it\u2019s draping across my shoulder! Stella screamed internally.\n\nThe pink, street-weathered stoner\u2019s snout gently opened and let out a contented sigh. Her eyes glimmered in the soft overhead light as they glanced up to the now fidgeting Stella, who\u2019s sharp, calculating inner-voice was clamming up just like in real life.\n\n\u201cY-you\u2019re so cute.\u201d she squeaked so quietly Reeda could just barely hear.\n\nBut she did hear, and her dark eyelids sunk into a half-open \u2018gotcha\u2019.\n\nStella\u2019s tail hammered against the bed with the grace of a sledgehammer, and her spines nearly tore the upholstery until Reed\u2019s own coiled around hers and held it down tenderly.\n \nThe avocado anime aficionado sat dumbfounded by the flood of feelings. She sat there, spaced out, while Reeda\u2019s face nearly flushed purple.\n \nIt was taking all her strength to suppress Stella\u2019s destructive emotional energy.\n\n\u201cG-gaawd! Okay. I give. You win the tail-wrestling trophy.\u201d Reeda wheezed.\n \nStella\u2019s heart pounded in her chest so hard each bump jostled the creases of her t-shirt.\n\nIt was her first time having a friend over who actually wanted to watch anime. She knew there was something special about this. Something very, very special.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t let it go to waste. \n\nAll she had to do was move.\n\nTheir bodies collided like a lightning strike. Their chests cushioned their impact as Stella pounced Reeda easily, her superior weight and lower center of gravity pinning the raptor to the bed.\n\n\u201cH-hey. Easy now.\u201d Reeda squawked in protest at first, but once Stella knowingly planted her wide, well cushioned rump across her belly and lap she quickly reconsidered. \n\n\u201cOooh~. That\u2019s the stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I saw the way you were staring at me back there. I um. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be into me. You seem so cool, and I\u2019m, well\u2026 like an isekai protagonist.\u201d Stella said.\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d Reeda replied between forced breaths, baring the weight of her well-endowed friend. \u201cYou\u2019re really cool, bro. I didn\u2019t put in the effort before, but I-\u201d she decided to say it before this -- whether a friendship or an extremely nerdy fling -- go any further, \u201cI quit the carfe. I\u2019m cleaning up. I- I\u2019ve been going through a lot lately. And, I feel really uncool for not being there. My head\u2019s been giving me a lot of trouble. It almost feels like I can\u2019t trust my own feelings, and it\u2019d shbe schill ifsh!-\u201d\n\nReeda\u2019s cheeks smeared together until her lips pursed. Her voice muffled between two massive, silky soft logs Stella called thighs.\n\nThe weeb looked down at Reeda with an innocent smile as she gently squeezed her legs, smothering the raptor in hot, meaty darkness. She practically milked the moan right out of her chair-friend\u2019s mouth with the gentlest shift of weight and occasional clench.\n\nDespite being completely interrupted and nearly suffocated, Reeda loved every second of her treatment. She could taste the sweat and heat of the stego flossing themselves in her mouth and nose. The best part was the completely innocent way she was getting dominated. Her entire body went hot as her trembling legs wrapped themselves around the circumference of Stella\u2019s tail, so frisky she had to touch something with everything she could.\n\nReeda\u2019s muffled moans filled the room until her tail thumped against the bed, a sign Stella correctly interpreted as a breathing warning.\n\nStella, expressionless aside from her innocent, sweet smile got off her raptorian chair. She only huffed with lust after she saw the beet-red, trembling body of her new anime explorer pal sprawled across the bed, immobilized and twitching. Stars swam in her eyes, and as she gasped her breasts swayed with reckless abandon.\n\nHer nipples poked through her shirt like diamond cutters.\n\n\u201cR-right on. Thanks for the rapport, bro,\u201d Reeda wheezed before she fainted. Her hand fell off the bed and bumped another dvd off the shelf:\nStella read it, then planted her knuckles at her chin like a jazz-club enthusiast and nodded sagely.\n\u201cHuh. Texhnolyze. Interesting choice. You ready for twenty-two episodes of cyberpunk existential dread?\u201d\nReeda grumbled. A trail of spittle trailed off her open-mouthed, satisfied face.\n\nShe managed a weak thumbs-up.","Title":"Reeda And Stella","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Reeda, Stella, Naser and Fang","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Anonymous"},"Reeda And Stella Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Reed And Reeda","Reeda And Stella Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Reeda and Stella pt. 2 (Hacked Up:\/\/Sign)\n\n\tA spotlight\u2019s beam blinded Reeda for a moment. Wherever she was, the darkness around her buzzed with excitement as thousands of tantalized mumbles, jeers, and wolf whistles ambushed her from all sides.\n\tDing ding!\n\tA bell rang, reminding her of all those years falling asleep to WWE re-runs. She then looked to herself and her eyes bugged out.\n\tA puce, v-shaped lycra bikini hugged against her toned body, the color scheme nearly matching her hot pink scales.\n\tBefore she could process what was going on, a flash of green slammed into her stomach with the force of a steel girder, knocking more than the wind from her as she shot across the mat like a skipping stone. \n\tIt was definitely a sakuga moment. One could marvel at how much effort and investment it took for a full twenty-four frames per second just to see Reeda tumble. Each full somersault depicted some cleavage, bush, and her shocked expression.\n\tOne could tell from the pantyshots alone that it was directed by Obhari.\n\tReeda dangled by the ropes after hitting her angle of repose. She wheezed pitifully as her body screamed at her, her muscles raw from a single blow.\n\tHer abdominal region was completely black and blue, taking the brunt of whatever hit her. \n\tEven thinking about standing up only hurt.\n\tJust then, a figure emerged from the endless flood of the spotlight.\n\tStella appeared, dressed in a formfitting, but relatively modest swimsuit, something you\u2019d see from a Japanese high school.\n\tIt was close enough to a unitard, and it only accentuated her belladonna hips as she stepped toward her downed opponent.\n\tThe crowd roared for blood as Stella\u2019s dainty footsteps tapped the mat. \n\tReeda could only look up to her opponent.

This style proliferated mainly because of how often he directed OVAs for various fighting games.\u201d\n\t\u201cGhhk.\u201d Reeda winced, but tried to pull herself up by the ropes. \u201cNot cool, bro. H-how did you get so damn strong?\u201d\n        But Stella kept talking: \u201cBy his twenties he directed several anime and licensed OVAs. He was also involved in various futanari projects.\n\t\u201cIf Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer is anything to go by, some say he burnt himself out with pantyshots and TNA. Who are we to say that, though? He worked since he was nineteen.\n\t\u201cWhat will you do by that age, Reeda?\u201d\n\tReeda opened her mouth to reply, but Stella clamped onto the top rope and swung forward. Her legs gracefully slid between the rope and around Reeda\u2019s head before a wall of muff slammed right into her face like a battering ram.\n\tReeda\u2019s tail thumped against the mat. It twitched and writhed with pleasure as the stegosaur clamped herself around Reeda\u2019s head once again.\n\tThe faceless mass in the darkness cheered and laughed.\n\n\tThunk!\n\tReeda awoke in the back of her van.\n\tBack on planet earth. \n       She felt something warm between her fingers, and found they slid down the front of her panties, which were soaked and warm.\n       Fuck! I\u2019m having wet dreams as an adult? Does that even happen? What\u2019s wrong with me? Reeda thought.\n       Another metallic thunk sounded, and her van rocked.\n       \u201cFuck off! This is my shitbox van! Go rob someone else!\u201d Reeda raged and pounded the wall of her van until a cluster of footsteps and giggles bolted away into the night.\n       She started the AC. The humidity ran her ragged and the involuntary orgasm left her filling the back with water bottles.\n       She stared at the laundry bag in the back corner. She tied it after the musk of sex wouldn\u2019t air out. She could still feel the soaked garments in general, as if they stared at her constantly.\n       When Stella smothered her out on that first visit, it took all the weight off her. Her body flushed with pleasure and that high of her scent left her helpless, open, ready for anything in ways not even carfe\u2019d measure up to.\n       But afterward, they spent the rest of the weekend just binging anime and talking. Stella didn\u2019t bring it up. Neither did she.\n       Am I going crazy? She thought. I know that shit fucking happened. A bro-ess doesn\u2019t forget the plush heft of an herbivore\u2019s legs.\n\tIt was something about that anime, especially shonen that got her on, she suspected. Something about seeing effeminate dudes groaning helplessly as an overcostumed villain makes an example of them\u2026\n       She found her mind drifting into lust again, and snapped herself out of it.\n       Was Stella okay? Her face was unreadable, and she thought she was good with that intuition stuff.\n       Was the nerd so overwhelmed she did all that\u2026 because she thought I wanted her to.\n       D-did I force her to do that?\n\tA sigh rattled out of Reeda\u2019s throat and a pit of worry tore through her heart.\n\tShe decided to escape the sex-reeked van and sit outside to stare to the stars. \n\t\u201cDo I have another addiction to worry about, or is life just like this?\u201d she said aloud to herself.\n\n\tAnother school week passed. Reeda found herself standing tall again, glowing, and cracking jokes. She managed to misdirect the other violently pink student, Naomi, until a herd of idiots smoking in the bathroom were able to flee from a first floor window.\n\tIt was a force of habit to help punks in need, and flustering Naomi with japery was fun.\n\tBand practice came and went as well. Same old. Same old. She enjoyed getting into sync with her friends, but Trish was a wall against any of her new lyrics:\n\t\u201c\u2019Megazord blastodon with a stain on his shirt\u2019?\u201d the blueberry triceratops grunted. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even mean anything.\u201d\n\t\u201cBut the Hitler bicycle stuff was okay? I\u2019m not grockin\u2019 it?\u201d Reeda asked, genuinely confused, but with a leveled tone.\n\tAnother argument fizzled out. A three voter system doesn\u2019t work if their frontliner was busy cuddling her new boyfriend. \n\tOh, who was she kidding? Fang and Anon were awesome together.\n\tBand practice went later into the night as usual. Of course, Reeda found herself moving the lighting equipment and cables back to the supply closet. She\u2019d even been messing with lenses she snagged from photography class to try out some trippier effects.\n\tShe took the long way around the school, making sure none of the art nerds catch her with their \u2018paralegally-aquired\u2019 equipment.\n\tA light blue washed over the sky that evening. The sun refused to set so easily as Reeda passed by the tall fence surrounding the school\u2019s swimming pool. Her eyes glued themselves to the shimmers of light playing off the rippling water.\n\tShe suddenly stopped. She thought the pool was closed around this time.\n\tSomeone rose from the water, her figure shapely and as sleek as porcelain.\n\tIt was Stella! She was wearing that same swimsuit as\u2026 that dream.\n\tThe black onesie only drew more attention to her lime green arms\u2026 and legs.\n\t\u201cReeda. Y-you\u2019re staring again.\u201d\n\tReeda jilted, partly for being caught peeping, and partly from realizing this wasn\u2019t another dream.\n\t\u201cSorry, bro! I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026 mmhmm.\u201d Reeda bit down on her lip. She was so hot it was like steam billowed from her mouth in the form of dumb words.\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2026 fluster you.\u201d Stella said. Her eyes drifted. Her arms clasped to her chest, as if offering a prayer to for the beet red raptor: may Raptor Jesus find it in his heart to cure this junkie, one of his own kin, of his post-addiction sensory floods.\n\t\u201cNo! I mean- No way, brosefina. I didn\u2019t mean to bug you. It\u2019s just, I didn\u2019t know you did swim team.\u201d \n\tPlay it cool, Reeda. Just be chill.\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t. I um, snuck in.\u201d\n\t\u201cSweet.\u201d\n\t\u201cI can access some of the water works from the pipes around here, so I got a spare key. Rosa knows more about that stuff.\u201d\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re really abusing your power, throwing that weight around.\u201d Reeda chuckled, casting a smirk and a sharp flick of her legendary eyelashes.\n\tStella squeaked and floundered.\n\tHook, line, and sinker.\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d she peeped desperately.\n\tReeda gently rested the box of equipment on the ground.\n\t\u201cOn one condition.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Stella asked, but immediately realized what when the raptor tore off her shirt, revealing a lean bubblegum-colored body and black sports bra.\n\n\tThe two screamed and hollered with as the pool\u2019s chill was the perfect antidote for the suffocating, humid heat. It was true Stella wasn\u2019t a sport swimmer, because Reeda beat her in every set they could remember: frontstroke, backstroke, jellyfishes, etc\u2026\n\tOf course, Reeda was more interested in the high dive. \n       Steeling herself, she took a running start before springing into the air. The world whirled around her axis as she stayed pencil straight, but pulled off a frontflip twister.\n\tStella\u2019s dazzled claps from the waters below made her heart swell.\n\tWith the rest of her fall to spare, she tucked herself tight and quickly managed a somersault. Once completed, her limbs shot back out for stylish flair, and to shoot Stella some finger gun-\n\tSMACK!\n\tStella shrieked.\n\tThe pink pistol of a raptor, the math whiz she was, let saurian error miscalculate her little trick, and she belly flopped into the water like a bag of wet cement falling from a skyline.\n\tReeda coughed up water. Her vision refocused yet again. It felt so familiar: all the muscles on her front side tenderized to hell and her head resting on Stella\u2019s well-cushioned lap.\n\tBefore she could contemplate shutting her eyes again, and taking advantage of the moment, a gruff voice and Stella\u2019s trembling shocked her into panic mode.\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why this isn\u2019t public access. Without a lifeguard, you stupid brats\u2019ll hurt yourselves!\n\tHow\u2019d you break in, anyhow?\u201d\n\tReeda felt Stella\u2019s body shake from the question. She managed to peel herself up and stare seriously at the round pterosaur security guard, who replied by shining his flashlight directly into her eyes. He wore a shocked grimace and wouldn\u2019t even look at her.\n\t\u201cWhat gives? No need to blind me, bud. I picked the lock, okay?\u201d\n\t\u201cYou picked it? You little delinquent.\u201d\n\t\u201cAu contraire. It\u2019s a useful skill. Easy and cheap to pick up, too. Remember this the next time you lock yourself out of your car.\u201d\n\tThe chubby ptero grunted with annoyance, obviously too impatient for a lecture on vocational skills.\n\t\u201cJust get out of here before someone sees you. And\u2026 get your garment.\u201d\n\tGarment?\n\tReeda noticed a strip of black floating daintily across the water. She then looked down to a pair of bare mounds on her chest.\n\tStella quickly threw the tarp back over her shoulders. \n\t\u201cI. I. I. Uh\u2026 I-\u201d Reeda stammered. Her brain overheated and her eyes shrank into minuscule pinpricks.\n\t\u201cI put that tarp over you for a reason.\u201d Stella muttered, her cheeks flushed from secondhand embarrassment.\n\n\t\u201cI\u2019m usually much cooler than this, I swear.\u201d \n\tStella joined Reeda in the back of her van. The pink raptor, thoroughly humiliated in both dreamland and the waking world, only allowed her snout to push out from the blanket of tarp.\n\tThe security guard claimed they should just keep it.\n\t\u201cIt was a great jump until the end. The high dive is too scary for me, anyways.\u201d Stella replied sweetly.\n\t\u201cYou make me wanna melt~.\u201d Reeda blurted, her words sliding out with the verbal fidelity of Elmer Fudd.\n\tStella gasped, then clutched her lap. \n\tReeda couldn\u2019t help but peer out from her idiot bag, at least to see the results of her Anon-tier pickup line.\n\tThe green stego\u2019s tail thumped hard enough to rock the entire van. Her hands wrung the hem of her t-shirt. Her eyes stared contemplatively through the front windshield, the moon illuminating those  aquamarine eyes.\n\tReeda wanted to tear her heart out and give it to the green sweetie as recompense for flustering her.\n\t\u201cI- I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not this frisky, I swear.\u201d\n\tThere I go, she thought, making excuses again\u2026\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry for abusing you.\u201d Stella whimpered, than rested her head against her knees until her tail coiled over to guard her face.\n\tReeda could still hear her sniffles. Her eyes widened with confusion, and she emerged from the tarp dressed in only a soaking bra and jeans.\n\t\u201cYou. Abuse me?\u201d she said, failing to restrain a chuckle.\n\tStella\u2019s tail parted from her face just enough to cast a stern glare from her welling eyes. \u201cYou were practically my seat. I still have claw marks on my\u2026 butt\u2026 because of how frenzied you got.\u201d\n\t\u201cI\u2026\u201d Reeda chuckled again. \u201cI can\u2019t argue there. I told you, I\u2019m getting over some problems-.\u201d\n\t\u201cYou can\u2019t blame everything on the carfe!\u201d Stella rebuked sharply.\n\t\u201cNo! You don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re chill.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re actually chill. There\u2019s no edge to you. Not like me. I-I only pretend to be cool, but I've hurt my friends for so long, and I've hurt you too. \n        \u201cStella, I love watching shows with you. It puts me at a peace I never knew before. Why do I deserve it? I-I\u2019m just a crusty dudette living out of her van. I didn\u2019t mean to overwhelm you with my\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cBurst of lust.\u201d Stella replied. Her expression softened, and she shot a grin to Reeda. \u201cI wish I was you. You seem to know yourself really well. You know what to say and you travel around, just picking up whatever you can from the world. I- I wish I could do that.\u201d\n        \u201cThat\u2026 and\u2026 um\u2026\u201d she trailed off.\n        \u201cStella. You\u2019re mumbling.\u201d Reeda said. She had an idea of what she would say just from the look on her face\u2026 and the nosebleed, but she wanted to hear it to be sure, still unsure about trusting her own senses.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re strong and hot.\u201d Stella peeped.\n        \u201cI know that.\u201d Reeda lounged on her shoulder, showing off her chest and flexing bicep. Her eyelashes flicked sensually again, tickling Stella pink.\n       They both chuckled, and Stella climbed onto her mop-topped raptor. She planted her butt firmly on her lap again, and gently adjusted her tush, letting her cheeks pancake out.\n       The look on Reed\u2019s face was priceless. Her eyes were fluttering.\n       \u201cI\u2019m really not that innocent.\u201d Stella said. \u201cI- I have trouble expressing myself, especially with sex, but that\u2019s why I live through anime. I put my energy into that. \n       \u201cThat\u2019s why I can dom you so hard.\u201d\n       She issued that like a challenge.\n       Without a word and despite her aches, Reeda rose. Stella tried to pin her down by the hands, but a nudge from her forearms were enough to overcome the weeb.\n       \u201cSo, you\u2019re secretly a horny little monster. And I thought you just had weird tastes.\u201d\n       As Stella\u2019s back pressed against a wrinkled, chlorine reeking tarp on the floor of the van, Reeda easily squatted over her. Her tail, while not as massive as Stella\u2019s, was fit as a whip. \n       It gently slid up the crotch of Stella\u2019s jeans. The blend of creamy smooth scales and downy feathers made her tremble as she quickly undid her zipper, letting Reeda closer to her sex.\n       Reeda simply stared at Stella as her face contorted. The mask of innocence gone, or at least the mask she thought she wore.\n       \u201cRaptor Jesus. You got me back then, but look at you. I don\u2019t even have to touch you to make you squirm.\n       Stella couldn\u2019t respond. She couldn\u2019t even moan as her entire body buzzed from the gentle slithering of her bropadre\u2019s tail.\n       Her mouth shifted between clenching tight to open-mouthed bliss. She didn\u2019t thrash nearly as much as Reeda did, but she heaved gently.\n       Reeda couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She pressed her palm to Stella\u2019s and with her free hand, simply felt her contours: the firm plated scales, the smooth flab of belly-skin.\n       Her ripe lime titties.\n       Stella clenched, her body unused to the gentle touch, and she accidentally kicked the back seat.\n       Reeda nodded attentively and tried to ease off, but Stella grabbed her wrist and pulled it back to her breast.\n       The raptor explored the tactile grace of Stella\u2019s body, letting her hand glide over her like fresh butter on toast. \n       She bit her lip so hard she drew blood. She trembled, almost loving the easy, soothing touches more that sex itself, but just then, something tugged at the front of her jeans.\n       With pinpoint accuracy, the weeb hooked her hand right into the crotch of Reeda\u2019s pants, and brushed the lips of her bare cunt.\n       The big dom dino shuddered and she bucked so hard she lost balance and tumbled onto Stella.\n\n       The van rocked so hard that night it set the alarm off twice. \n       After numerous complaints, a squad car rolled up around five a.m.\n       One of the officers looked through the front window, only to find a pair of full moons as the bare-bodied dinos watched a show from Stella\u2019s phone.\n       \u201cWoooah bro. Where\u2019s the robbery?\u201d Reeda asked coolly, letting her tail drape over the both of them to provide some cover."},"Reeda And Stella Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Reed And Reeda","Reeda And Stella Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"Reeda and Stella Pt. 3 (FINALE):\nWrecked Mongolian Mosh Squad\n\nReeda and Stella could almost hear smooth jazz in the air as a mini-cooker sizzled from the open back of the astrovan.\nThe morning air was chill. After those cops rolled by it was hard to sleep. \n\nStella realized just how easy it was to wake up early when you didn\u2019t have a house and saurs ticketed you for camping around for more than twenty-four hours at a time.\n\nAnd that\u2019s if the neighborhood watch boomers and cops were generous.\n\nReeda casually mentioned the thieves as well. She wasn\u2019t trying to brag or scare the sheltered stego. It was just something she dealt with, so the truth came out as it was.\nShe took solace in being able to let her mask slip like that.\n\n\u201cIs it okay if we talk about something else? You\u2019re starting to bum me out,\u201d Stella asked.\n\nNever mind.\n\n\u201cOh. Yeah. So how\u2019s your grandma? Are you cool living with her?\u201d Reeda asked. She hid her disappointment by staring into the broiling concoction of a diced vegetarian gas station burrito and several eggs.\n\nShe licked her maw needily, but leaned against Stella\u2019s broad shoulder.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s okay\u2026 She\u2019s demanding sometimes. She\u2019s used to people working hard for her. She was head of the Geology Department at RexU\n\nHer trepidation was apparent, and she stared off into the distance as if trying to avoid her own words. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t walk in you riding my head like a bicycle seat.\u201d Reeda cracked the lewd analogy at her own expense.\n\nStella\u2019s beak clenched. Her cheeks pinkened.\n\n\u201cWheelchair,\u201d she corrected.\n\n\u201cIs that why there\u2019s a single stair up to your room?\u201d Reeda asked.\n\nStella smirked.\n\n\u201cDevilish, bro!\u201d Reeda hollered.\n\n--\n\nStella and Reeda continued their weekly flings for a while. They watched anime mainly on Stella\u2019s recommendation, but after scoping some swap meets, Reeda snagged some factory sealed Mad House OVAs.\n\nThey laughed their asses off at the Central Park Studio localizations; the VA work consisting of three chain-smoking Bostonians in a broom closet. \n\nBut even with all this media -- all these high theatrics and hyberbolic, whacked out premises played straight, all this speculative fiction and smut and ultra-gore alike -- once their precious films ended they were left with a dark screen and empty reflections of themselves within.\n\nThey could spend hours talking about anything as long as it circumnavigated the concepts of these shows, but Stella found Reeda overbearing when it came to breaching her privacy. And likewise, Reeda found Stella inhibited and unwilling to open up about her own problems, or listen to her's.\n\nImages of their last weekend still burned in their peripheries:\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t you look at me right now? What are you thinking about? I-I\u2019m losing patience, bro.\u201d Reeda grunted. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it, okay!? You think I want to live here? I can\u2019t run off and have adventures like you do?\u201d Stella shouted back.\n\n\u201cIs that what you think I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust get on the bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey! Uncool. Unlock the door!\u201d\n\nTHWUMP!\n\nIn her crammed room, Stella\u2019s giant tail gave Reeda no chance to dodge. It was just like that dream all over again\u2026\n\nThe weeb cried. She said it was an accident, that she was scared and didn\u2019t want her to leave.\n\nFuck, Reeda thought. Then why won\u2019t you let me in.\n\n--\n\nReeda winced as she brushed her abs. The welt was still as dark as the dirty background cels in Gundam Zeta.\n\nCamille was definitely a girl\u2019s name, but that dude fulfilled a Freudian loop in the first four episodes. He killed his mom (accident) and dad (through duel), which is more development than most real people get.\n\nReeda then realized what she was thinking about. \n\nStella was rubbing off on her.\n\nShe crunched the bead at the end of her menthol cigarette and purged her lungs with intoxicating mint smoke. She hid under the awning of the Forever 24\/7 to evade a cloudless blast of piss yellow drenching the city in blazing sun.\n\nShe didn\u2019t feel up to band practice and her van was still out of gas\u2026 a block away from Stella\u2019s apartment.\n\nSpeak of the devil: the mint witch herself panted. Unused to running, her footsteps slapped the ground loudly. \n\nReeda nearly put her cig out and walked away right then and there, but boy did the stego\u2019s hips bounce. It kept her distracted just long enough to meet the meek smile of her\u2026 friend? Girlfriend? \n\nSomebody.\n\nStella floundered immediately under Reeda\u2019s harsh scowl. She never saw creases that stretched across her smooth, dainty, bubblegum muzzle like that before.\n\nShe found her legs trembling again. Her skin tightened under more than one kind of heat.\n\nShe peeped nervously, pulled a shirt from her bag, and knelt before the pissy pink dino.\n\nIt was a bootleg Devilman t-shirt. The art was traced via pen but there was still some nice hatching to it. The eyes were off center on the portrait shot, creating an image both funny and uncanny simultaneously.\n\nReeda couldn\u2019t help but smile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not good at staying mad,\u201d she sighed, and accepted the shirt right away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything, if you want. I didn\u2019t mean to hit you.\u201d Stella murmured. \n\n\u201cYeah yeah. I know, no one can resist these guns~.\u201d she cheered, and flexed her sizable biceps.\n\nStella cooed and glomped Reeda against the wall of the convenience store with a loud thump.\n\nTheir mouths met. Reeda cupped each of Stella\u2019s buttocks and lifted her off the ground, angling her better to taste the mint nicotine off her tongue.\n\nTheir tails coiled around each other and swayed in unison until their combined strength (and Stella\u2019s dangerous spines) smashed the side of a video rental kiosk.\n\nThat\u2019s when they decided to run.\n\n--\n\nReeda changed into her new shirt at the park overlooking the harbor. There, she told Stella the only way to make it up to her was to get outside her comfort zone, and she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna mosh at Patina\u2019s Pub.\u201d Reeda stated.\n\n\u201cAre you sure? Those metalhead guys are huge. They\u2019re really scary.\u201d Stella asked wispily. \n\n\u201cNah. That\u2019s just an appearance thing to filter out the softies. They\u2019re pretty nice. \n\u201cJust don\u2019t accept drinks from em\u2019.\u201d she added sharply.\n\nStella didn\u2019t know how small she was. The inner city burned into her with sights and sounds and scents: seven-way intersections designed by acidhead spiders, skyscrapers smeared with grime, the light cinnamon clouds off a churro vendor.\n\nIf she didn\u2019t take Reeda\u2019s hand it\u2019d suck her into its enormity like a vortex. Maybe she was an isekai character afterall, but a stranger in her own life.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t help but huddle against Reeda on one of the many bus lines. They did this partly to protect their bags, but Stella\u2019s round nostrils flared to inhale Reeda\u2019s sweat.\n\nShe smelled like everything; the outside world the mysterious, downtrodden pink raptor had to face every day. \nThe world that molded her whether she wanted it or not.\n\nA hand gently caressed her hair, riding the straight strands down to her neck. \n\n\u201cYou doing alright down there? We\u2019re almost there. I\u2019ll take care of the sodas. Just don\u2019t get boozed up. We\u2019re here to battle, got it?\u201d Reeda\u2019s voice vibrated through her chest and into Stella\u2019s ear. \n\nIt tickled.\n\n\u201cYes. Thank you, Reeda.\u201d Stella said, then clasped her hand.\n\n--\n\nPatina\u2019s Pub bustled in the mid-afternoon, but it always seemed to bustle. Stella never saw anything like it before. It was obviously a historical landmark, a wooden, Victorian-styled building complete with sensual curves in its etchings and chair legs. \n\nThe numerous hunting trophies, mainly head mounts of elk, vibrated from the constant harmonious screeching of a ptero band in the concert hall: a small back patio.\n\nThe colorful couple, Reeda dressed in tatters and her gifted tee and Stella her shorts and OPPAI shirt, swaggered boldly passed the sizable bouncers and inside, where a wall of noise electrified their very bones.\n\nReeda led Stella through the front end of the pub, the bar section. The men and women there looked like background goons in any number of anime. These guys had to be thirty, but they dressed like messier versions of Fang, and they wore patches all over themselves. They looked like scarecrows from a children\u2019s story.\n\nSome of them cast glares at Reeda, who simply straightened her posture and ignored them. \n\nStella felt the chill of tension from this exchange. She didn\u2019t know Reeda used to brew their carfe with a chemist\u2019s expertise unmatched by many, or that she had to stay at Trish\u2019s house for over a month after they found her house. \n\nThat was when her parents disowned her. \n\nStella didn\u2019t know this. She would never know.\n\nThe moment passed, and the tension lifted as they entered a doorway like some Thelemic ritual. They stood in the eye of the storm now, where the shitty metal bands played loud enough to be loved by anyone, and directed rippling walls of flesh and denim to fill the cracks of the room and crash together.\n\nStella was overwhelmed. She backed away from the noise and pressed into any wall she could. This took a while given the thrashing crowd, but none of them shoved or body checked her. She seemed to permeate through them until reaching safety.\n\nMeanwhile, a wild, pink mane bounced in the innermost eddying of violence. She was small, but threw herself into every passing body like a dancing star. Her face twisted into a demon\u2019s smile, razor teeth clenched tight.\n\nBut every body she displaced swelled back, sandwiching her between multiple guts until she gasped into the choking sound.\n\nBecause there was no air here.\n\nOnly electricity, bitch.\n\nStella squealed from secondhand pain as an ankylosaur the size of Fang\u2019s dad bodyslammed Reeda so hard she splayed against the wall like a sticker, and tumbled to the floor. \n\nThe man\u2019s expression was soft, and he peeled the raptor back onto her feet.\n\nThen, he bodyslammed her again in the very next swell.\n\nThe green stego\u2019s eyes still flitted across the room like a startled doe, her hands folded to her chest to protect herself. However, it finally started to make sense. Almost like the playground rules of elementary school or a skatepark, there was an unspoken conduct. \n\nIt seemed fairly consistent, aside from the parasaurolophus plucking glass shards out of her face.\n\nIt reminded her of Naomi, for some reason.\n\nStella found herself riding the current of the mosh, from the safe corners of the room into the choppier, more visceral waves. \n\nShe gently rode them back and forth, easing into the rush.\n\nHer soft, cute expression hardened as she neared the apex of this mosh. Her lips curled into a grin and eyes narrowed until knife-like creases formed against her round face.\n\nHer hefty hip checks were enough to floor many a potential foe, and while she accepted the occasional challenge of a comeback tackle or a repeat slammer, her sights were set on Reeda:\n\nThe chill, pink raptor.\n\nHer only anime friend? \n\nFuck pal.\n\nA peppy, spirited, intuitive sweetheart?\n\nA bitter power-bottom with a lascivious appetite.\n\nReeda\u2019s spirit glowed, but her body was raw and loose. The pain buzzing from her nerves were deadened by pure adrenaline. It was easy to tell she was working off years of anger after she performed a flying clothesline powerful enough to floor that ankylo. \n\nThey both laughed, and then she strained to help him up.\n\nThen their eyes met: Reeda and Stella.\n\nNeither of them smiled as they picked up speed toward each other. Stella wore a confident grin while Reeda, battle hardened, only plunged toward her as a hunter with a spearlike snout.\n\nThey didn\u2019t have time to marvel at the pack intuition of the room: how the flailing limbs seemed to arc away from them or part just to give them space, or how the down-tuned dual guitars of the band screeched into a crescendo along with the vocalists\u2019 voice:\n\u201cWhadd you mean my SSR-ID\u2019s gone? The water bill\u2019s come and I don\u2019t gotta paper presence!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you to whack me you weeb bitch! Hot-and-cold brat! Homely, spoiled cunt!\u201d Reeda roared.\n\n\u201cYou crusty punk! Bitter, aloof shit! You belong under my ass, butt slut!\u201d Stella screamed.\n\nEverything that was Reeda and Stella -- a pair of blurs, pink and green -- threw themselves through the air at full speed. Their impact reverberated through the concert hall with a loud CRACK!\n\nEven the drummer groaned at the result.\n\n--\n\n\u201cHahaha. Raptor Jesus Christ, dude,\u201d someone chuckled drunkenly.\n\n\u201cWho let these fucking kids in here?\u201d a hiss of a whisper called out.\n\n\u201cCall their fucking parents or something,\u201d another hiss.\n\nReeda and Stella huddled in the corner of a piss soaked, sticker coated bathroom. They cried openly, but no one could blame them. It\u2019d been a long time since anyone saw a snoot-on-snoot collision of that magnitude.\n\n\u201cThis is why you have to be careful. You\u2019re lucky some of us have med skills.\u201d The large ankylosaur from earlier spoke calmly. His expert hands wrapped the mangled, bulbous ends of their snouts in bandages. They were already soaking with blood from the plump tomatoes at the ends of their snouts: the impact site.\n\n\u201cI got no idea how it didn\u2019t turn out worse. We\u2019d get closed down if some kids like you went to the hospital.\u201d he said more sternly.\n\nThick beams of bendy plastic slid around both sides of the length of their snouts. They were children\u2019s medical equipment: purple and covered with stickers of twee saurs eating leaves. He wrapped them along with small cages at the end of their snouts to protect the injury sites.\n\nIt\u2019d be impossible to hide these snoot splints from their friends, and any pressure on even a human\u2019s nose cartilage was enough to force one to tears. \n\nIt was much, much worse for the dino women.\n\n--\n\nNaser enjoyed a quiet afternoon on the cafeteria patio, slowly conquering his calc assignments under a pink sunset at Volcano High with his even pinker girlfriend.\n\nThen, he got a call. There was shrill, hysterical screaming on the other end. It was Fang. Naser\u2019s eyes\u2019 narrowed, revealing bags that made him look a decade older than reality.\n\nHe argued with Fang, then with Naomi until he got into the NasCar to drive to some less-than-colorful joint downtown.\n\n\u201cAre they alright?\u201d he asked, not knowing if he\u2019d get an answer or another verbal lashing.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Fang huffs. She threw her long, silvery bangs to the side. \u201cJust\u2026 when the hell did Reeda and Stella party together? I didn\u2019t know Stella did anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey better not be carfing it. If they stink, I\u2019m not driving them. Dad\u2019ll kill me if he thinks we\u2019re doing drugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck off! Reeda quit that stuff.\u201d She shot back, defending her friend and her own faith in her.\n\nBy the time they arrived, several disgruntled punks and metalheads delivered the bent-snouted women to the car, then promptly told them to fuck off. \n\nNaser obliged, terrified at the very sight of them getting near his car.\n\nHe didn\u2019t have to ask why Fang\u2019s friends looked like Bane. One good thing about having a sis- sibling like Fang is she can do all the talking for him:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you stupid dweebs. You had to off-put all this shit on me to come pick you guys up!?\u201d Fang barely tapped a fingernail onto Reeda\u2019s tomato-snout. It was enough to paralyze her with pain.\n\n\u201cAuuugh! Maximally uncool!\u201d the pink raptor whimpered. \n\n\u201cYou ditched practice! We had to play acoustically today. What\u2019s your excuse?\u201d\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t wanna go. I finally have my life back and I had some soul-searching to do. This involved watching dozens of hours of Japanese animation and getting sat on by a pear-bottomed sweetheart, who I also wanted to bodyslam through a brick wall.\u2019\n\nIt all made perfect sense in her head, but Fang already put the fear of pain in her, and she trembled out a faux chill, \u201cI lost track of time. We were just\u2026 hanging out!\u201d \n\nShe tried to chuckle sweetly.\n\nEven Naser scoffed.\n\nEyes then turned to Stella. She hadn\u2019t made a peep this whole time and frankly, no one knew what she thought. She just stared into her bruised lap.\n\n\u201cStella? What happened?\u201d Fang asked.\n\n\u201cWe had a fling for a while, but it\u2019s over now. We worked everything out,\u201d she said sweetly.\n\nFang\u2019s eyes opened wide enough to wrinkle her entire face. Her long, elegant snout fell into an open-mouthed gawk.\n\nThe green stego\u2019s face was a cherub\u2019s smile, but her lips curled into a devilish grin as Fang turned to Reeda, who\u2019s eyes nearly rolled out of their sockets. \n\nReeda stammered illegibly for several seconds as her face glowed. The proverbial spaghetti shot from her pockets and all over the car like confetti.\n\nStella's hand gently grasped Reeda\u2019s. \n\nShe then whispered, loud enough for everyone to hear:\n\u201cThis is why I get to be dom.\u201d\n\nNaser struggled to contain his huffy excitement, and nearly blew a stoplight.\n\nFang pinched both Stella and Reeda by the snoots as punishment for making her hear that.\n \n\u201cJ-just drop them off on the next corner.\u201d She sighed."}},"Rosa":{"Garden Of Rosa -After Dark- Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa -After Dark- Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: Garden Of Rosa -After Dark-\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Rosa, Stella and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nGarden of Rosa -After Dark-\n\nRosa pulled me quickly through the front door of the apartment, pushing me against the door as it shut behind us. In seconds she was on me, her tongue thrusting deep within my mouth as she hooked her hands underneath my shirt, practically tearing it off me before resuming our slopy kissing. My hands reached out to grab her ass through her skirt, fingers digging into her thick cheeks as Rosa moaned against my mouth. Not stopping there, I moved one hand to her massive breasts, kneading the massive mound beneath her shirt as I teased her hardening nipples. That elicited more than just a moan from Rosa, the gasp escaping her lips before she could hide it behind a breathy giggle. \n\n\u201cMmmm, An-on, so forceful!\u201d Rosa ran her tongue along my ear, her voice a seductive whisper. \u201cYou want to see more, papi? Do you like my nice. Thick. Body?\u201d Rosa punctuated each word by grinding herself against me, pressing her ample tits against my bare chest as her hands caressed my rock-hard cock through my jeans. \u201cTake my dress off, An-on\u2026\u201d \n\nMy hands leapt to obey, my desire to fuck this sexy Latina nearly overriding my desire to tease her more. Managing some semblance of control, I slowly pull Rosa\u2019s floral-print dress up, letting it catch on her ponderous ass before freeing her cheeks with a soft -clap!-, her lacey black-and-red panties barely hiding her full bush. Rosa purred in delight as her dress went higher, exposing her slightly pudgy belly, raising her arms as her dress traveled over her massive rack. It let the dress catch on her tits for a moment, savoring the sight of those huge breasts dropping out of the loose fabric. Rosa\u2019s bra matched her panties, the same lacey black-and-red material straining to contain her bountiful bosom. Finally the dress was off, and I discarded it carelessly as I went back to tongue-fucking Rosa\u2019s mouth. \n\nRosa herself seemed glad to be out of her dress, attacking my pants with renewed vigor, moaning in delight as her hands swiftly unbuckled my belt. Breaking our make-out session, Rosa planted kisses down my chest and abdomen as she crouched before me, her crimson eyes staring seductively up at me as she nuzzled the growing bulge in my boxers, kissing and licking my member through the thin fabric as she tugged my pants down around my ankles. \n\n\u201cOooh, An-on, es tan grande\u2026\u201d The boxers didn\u2019t last much longer, my dick springing free and slapping Rosa across the face with a soft -plop!-. Rosa\u2019s eyes crossed as she struggled to focus, my dick sitting too close to her face. It was easily as long as her face, pre-cum drooling down off my tip and onto her auburn hair. Another soft giggle escaped Rosa\u2019s lips as her long tongue ran up the length of my shaft, careful to keep her nose-horn safely away from any fleshy parts. Reaching the end, Rosa planted a chaste kiss on my slit before standing up, quickly stripping her bra and panties off as she did so. Taking my cock in her hand, she slowly stroked my throbbing member as she lead me further inside the apartment. \n\n\u201cI know ~just~ what to do, An-on. Come, si\u00e9ntate a mi lado!\u201d Giggling, Rosa dropped herself onto the soft couch of the living room, patting the space next to her. Smiling quizzically, I took my place next to her, our hands immediately exploring the other\u2019s body as if drawn by magnets. Free from the bra, Rosa\u2019s tits felt heavy, each massive milk-jug easily bigger than my head, her bright pink nipples standing in stack contract to the pale skin on the front of her body. Free from my boxers, my dick twitched eagerly in Rosa\u2019s hand, her fingers softly tugging up and down my length, using my drooling pre-cum as lube. \n\n\u201cJust lean down, mi amor, that\u2019s it\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s hand cradles my head as she lowers me onto her lap, gazing down at me with almost motherly affection. My view of her face is spoiled somewhat by the fat fucking pair of tits lying on top of me though, and as I struggle to shift into a position where I can see Rosa clearly she coos softly, guiding my mouth to her right breast, still stroking me off with her other hand. \n\n\u201cShhh, shhh, that\u2019s it mi amor. You like my big fat tits, don\u2019t you? Such a ni\u00f1o malo, An-on\u2026\u201d My mouth clamps down on Rosa\u2019s nipple like a babe to their mother\u2019s breast, teasing the small nub with my tongue before sucking eagerly, my eyes closed. Rosa quickens her strokes, twisting her hand around my cock with each pump, a wet -schlick- -schlick- -schlick- echoing through the empty apartment. \u201cThat\u2019s right, suck on that huge fucking tit, An-on. Mmmm, your cock is so r\u00edgido! I can barely get my hand around it, it\u2019s so\u2026 big!\u201d Peeking, I can see Rosa admiring my cock as she pumps her hand on it like a pussy. Her technique is wonderful as she alternates between teasing my tip with her thumb and using just her thumb and forefinger to slide across the head of my shaft. At this point we don\u2019t even need lube, my dick leaking profusely.   \n\nBut Rosa wasn\u2019t the only one with skills. Rosa\u2019s increased pace makes me suck harder, letting her nipple pop out of my mouth repeatedly before flicking it with my tongue. I can her Rosa moaning in delight each time I latch onto her breast, and she begins to squirm under me, her soaking wet pussy hot against my back.  Using my free hand, I play with her other massive milker, alternating my nipple-pinches in time with my tongue-flicking. The combined efforts on her titflesh sends Rosa into overdrive, causing her to scream and pant, her hand becoming a blur on my throbbing cock.\n\n\u201cFUCK! Ao-on, yes, just -ah!- like that! \u00a1Ohhh, si si si si si SI SI SI!\u201d I quickly my attack on Rosa\u2019s tits, biting her nipple softly in time with her screams. Rosa herself keeps her focus on my cock, pumping her fist along my length faster than I\u2019ve ever seen something move before. I\u2019m leaking like a faucet at this rate, giving her hand a smooth glide up and down. I know I can\u2019t keep this up; feeling my orgasm building, I redouble my attack on Rosa\u2019s ponderous titflesh, sucking and twisting like my life depends on it. \n\u201c\u00a1Me estas -ah!- volviendo loca! \u00a1M\u00e1s duro, papi! \u00a1Dios m\u00edo, SIIIIIII!\u201d Rosa arches her back, thrusting her breast even more into my face, blocking my airflow. Beneath me, I can feel her pussy convulse, her legs twisting and grinding together. At the same time I achieve my own release, moaning into Rosa\u2019s chest as my penis throbs. My cum rockets into the air, each spurting rope falling back into us with a wet -plop-. Some even cascade off the side of the couch, splattering against the hardwood floor nosily. Rosa still doesn\u2019t let up, her hand pumping out more and more of my thick jizz, each rope that falls back onto her just adding more lubrication for her strokes. \n\nAfter what feels like minutes, I can feel my orgasm subside, my nuts slowly unclenching after delivering their sticky payload. I\u2019m suddenly aware that I\u2019m being smothered by Rosa\u2019s fat tits, the thick Latina still stroking my softening member as she holds me to her breast. Rosa\u2019s squeals of delight have fallen silent as well, and she stares down at me, panting, her eyes glowing with a lustful light. Each breath Rosa takes makes her chest bounce slightly on top of me, the weightiness of her tits pinning me to her lap. Her hair is a mess, thick ropes of errant cum clinging to the few parts of her luscious locks not already slick with sweat. The breast lying on my chest is likewise covered in spunk, as is my abdomen and, from the feel of it, most of my legs. Finally, Rosa lets me pull free from her breast, thick strands of drool still clinging from my mouth to her nipple, fixing me with a horny stare.\n\n\u201cAn-on, you were supposed to cum insid-\u201d \n\nThe rest of Rosa\u2019s sentence is cut off by an ear-splitting shriek. Springing upward, I can see Stella standing there, staring at us wide-eyed, her hands covering her mouth. The pizzas we sent her to pickup lay on the floor beneath her, their contents spilled across the floor. \n\n\u201cRosa! Anon! Wha\u2026 What the heck is this?!\u201d Beginning a stammered apology, I attempt to sit up, the effort proving fruitless. Rosa still pins me beneath her bosom, her hand idly tracing up and down my sticky shaft. For some reason the sexy Latina is smiling at me, watching me struggle with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. \n\n\u201cRosa, you started without me!\u201d\n","Title":"Garden Of Rosa -After Dark-","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Rosa, Stella and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Anonymous"},"Garden Of Rosa -After Dark- Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa -After Dark- Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"Garden of Rosa -After dark-\n\nChapter 2 \n\nStella\u2019s words cut through my sex-addled haze. My eyes flickered between Stella and Rosa, the former just barely visible around Rosa\u2019s massive boobs, still pinning me to her lap. To my erotic horror, I could see Stella starting to strip, her clothes quickly flying down to join the pizza as she prepared to make good on her words. Stella\u2019s body was magnificent; not nearly as thick as Rosa\u2019s, but her tits were just as massive, her large areola perfecting framing her already-hardening nipples. As Stella pulled down her striped panties (because of course they were), I could see her pussy was already soaking wet in anticipation.\n\n\u201cAy, seems someone else is a little eager, eh An-on?\u201d Rosa licked her lips hungrily, her hand teasing my nuts as my cock twitched itself back to life. I had been so focused on watching Stella strip, I didn\u2019t even notice my dick growing rock-hard. \n\n\u201cHey, no fair, Rosa! You already got a turn, I should get Anon alone this time!\u201d Stella stood in front of the couch now, her hands on her hips in a huff as she glared at her friend. This close, I could make out Stella\u2019s scent: A decidedly weeby musk of bad novelty perfume and unwashed clothes. I could also make out that Stella\u2019s cunt was leaking like a faucet down her thighs; clearly, the stego-slut was very excited at the prospect of a turn alone with me.\n\n\u201cAy, si, si, you are right Stella. It is only fair that you get a turn with An-on alone.\u201d Rosa began shuffling sideways, smacking me in the face with her massive Mexican mammaries before letting me drop off her lap and onto the couch. I could feel that cushion beneath me was soaked in Rosa\u2019s girl-cum, the sticky wet mess serving as proof of my tit-sucking abilities. \n\n\u201cGood! Now, Anon, as punishment for starting without me, I get to do whatevvvvver I want to you!\u201d Stella was already up onto the couch, squatting low over my erect cock, pussy-drool already lathering up my shaft. \u201cSooo, I choose this!\u201d And with that, Stella jammed herself down on my shaft, plunging the full length of my rod into her snatch.\n\n\u201cOooooooooh FUCK! Rosa, he\u2019s. So. Fucking. BIG!\u201d Stella began to bounce on my cock, using the back of the couch to steady herself with one hand. The other begin kneading her large lactators, pinching and rolling her hard nipples as her breathing became even more ragged. \u201cThis! Is! Definitely! Like! My! Japanese! Animes!\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, were these the animes I caught you watching, Stella? The \u2018hen-tai\u2019?\u201d Rosa watched from the floor as her friend rode my hot monkey dick, a wicked grin on her face. Rosa\u2019s hair was still matted with cum, but the luscious Latina didn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cSee? I told you it would feel better with a real hombre\u2026\u201d Rosa had started to crawl towards us on all fours, her huge tits hanging pendulous beneath her. \u201cA real sexy man, with a nice big dick to fuck us raw.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! YES! Fuck me raw, Anon! Fuck me with your hawt fuckin\u2019 cock!\u201d Stella\u2019s tongue lolled out of her mouth as she continued to cunt-fuck herself on my shaft, the wet clapping of her fat ass echoing through the apartment. I was content to lay back, resting my hands behind my head, letting Stella do all the work as she half-fell forwards, catching herself by smashing into my stomach. Fuck, that weeb could ride some dick; from the sounds of it, Stella may have had some practice of her own, however\u2026\n\nMy thoughts were interrupted by the last thing I expected: Rosa\u2019s ponderous pussy and ass, crashing down onto my face. My mouth is suddenly filled with the rank smell of horny dino pussy, Rosa\u2019s bush amplifying the heady scent. As the sweet, salty taste of Rosa filled my mouth, I could hear a muffled moan from Stella, Rosa\u2019s ass cheeks large enough to cover my ears.\n\n\u201cAww! No! Fair! Rosa! This was *ah!* my turn! Get your own *fuck!* seat!\u201d Stella\u2019s riding had slowed down a bit as she argued, but by no means did the insatiable green gooner stop. Instead, Stella took to twisting and grinding on my dick, squeezing her pussy walls around me as she did so. My pleasuable moans were stifled by the soaking cunt plastered to my mouth. Where the fuck did she learn to do that?!\n\n\u201cAy, I\u2019m not cheating, Stella! You hand An-on\u2019s dick, and I have his face. An-on, you had better start down there, because I am no getting off until you get me off!\u201d \n\nI could almost laugh at the terrible pun, had my nose not been buried deep in Rosa\u2019s ass. So, she wanted another turn then? Well, two could play at that game\u2026\n\nA sharp gasp escaped Rosa\u2019s lips as I buried my tongue as deep as it could go into her waiting snatch, plunging Rosa\u2019s plump pussyfolds with every inch I could manage. Coincidentally, Stella was accomplishing much the same feat, instead utilizing my rock-hard shaft to plug up her hungry snatch. The three of us quickly settled into a rhythm: Stella bouncing opposite in time to my own thrusts into Rosa\u2019s pussy, each of us moaning with reckless abandon. Soon, the room echoed with the screams of the two women as they used my body for their own pleasure, the loud clapping of Stella\u2019s ass providing a pleasant baseline to the music of our carnal sex orgy. Despite my efforts to the contrary, I could feel my balls begin to clench, a telltale sign that my orgasm was about to arrive. \n\nWhich was for the best, really, because Rosa was literally smothering me with her ass. \n\nI knew my only hope for survival was to get Rosa off as quickly as possible. Leaving Stella to ride the cock carousel, I re-focused my efforts on Rosa\u2019s sopping wet snatch, pulling out all the stops: I started flicking her clit with my tongue, teasing the sensitive bud before sucking it repeatedly into my mouth, all the while driving my tongue deeper into her folds. Rosa responded by screaming out in Spanish, clenching my head between her thighs as she too leaned her hands on my chest. I can hear Stella getting close as well, given that her high-pitched wails had begun sounding just like the girls in MY Japanese animes (if you catch my drift). It was shame that they sounded like they were on the other end of a long tunnel; I wouldn\u2019t enjoyed bringing two women to orgasm had my brain not been cut off from it\u2019s precious oxygen. But hey: Two hot, sexy women using my body like a sex-toy? There were worse ways to die, I suppose.\n\nOnly, Stella did something just then that saved my life.\n\n\u201cOh FUCK! Rosa, kiss me! Quick, nownownownowNOW!\u201d Without waiting for a response, I could feel Stella\u2019s weight shift on my stomach, no doubt her hand pulling her Latina-love in for a kiss. Rosa\u2019s Spanish shrieking was cut off momentarily, as was Stella\u2019s would-be JAV audition. Stella must be a damn good kisser, because the combination of what I was doing below and what she was doing above was enough to set Rosa off. Rosa\u2019s legs and pussy convulsed on top of me, allowing me to gulp some precious air before going back under, Rosa\u2019s muffled moans matched my own as I started blasted jizz deep inside Stella\u2019s wet snatch. Stella quickly joined us in our orgasm orgy, her body twitching on top of me as my sperm flooded her waiting womb (probably). Still I continued to kiss and tongue-fuck Rosa\u2019s cunt, ensuring her orgasm was strung-out as long as my own as Stella continued to bounce up and down, skewering herself as deep as she could each time. \n\nI swear, if Stella was doing the anime \u201cV\u201d signs with her hands, and I missed that\u2026\n\nEventually, the two women sagged on top of me, panting heavily as their legs twitched uselessly. I managed to roll out from underneath them, ignoring Stella\u2019s feeble protests as I slid out of her thoroughly-fucked pussy with a wet *plop*. Landing on my back, I could see the two of them sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, backs against the back of the couch, panting heavily as they attempted to recover their senses. Stella\u2019s hand was still entwined with Rosa\u2019s, their fingers interlinked as the two women\u2019s eyes rolled back to the front of their heads. \n\n\u201cTime for both of us, Anon\u201d, they said together\n"},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: Garden Of Rosa\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Rosa, Rosa's Mom, Rosa's Dad, Stella, Reed, Trish, Fang, Naser, Naomi and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nGarden of Rosa \n\nThe fog is thick this morning as I make the trek to Volcano High, silently cursing Trish.

Damn that little purple pain-in-the-ass, ruining my perfectly good weekend just for a little revenge\u2026 Sighing, I pull my jacket closer around me. A part of me knows that I\u2019m not mad at missing my shitposting time, even if it is prime Euro hours right now: Today, Fang and I had made plans to hang out a bit. She said she was going to expose me to some good music, something about a record store she liked. Reed was gonna come along too, so at least Fang had some company today, but her text back this morning seemed pretty bummed. Maybe I can make it up to her\u2026Ugh, why do I feel this way?\n\nAfter what feels like an eternity, I finally make it to the back of the school, the resplendent gardens laid out before me. Strangely, there\u2019s no sign of Rosa or Stella anywhere, the assembled gardening tools laid out as before, a small group of students standing directionless in front of them. Silently I join the back of the line, hoping to avoid attention as I whip out my phone, hoping to send a quick text to Fang. Before I can finish, Rosa comes storming out of the school, hurrying over. It\u2019s not like her to be late to these Campus Beautification projects, and something seems to have upset her. Rosa tries to hide it as she walks to the front of the group, but I catch her wiping her eyes on her palm, clear evidence of tears apparent on her face. \n\n\u201cAh, so sorry everyone! I was\u2026 dealing with some things.\u201d Rosa takes a deep breath to steady herself, clapping her hands together as much to get our attention as to calm her own nerves. What could be the matter? Rosa starts to hand out gardening equipment, to the assembled crowd, not looking anyone in the eye. \u201cToday should go quickly, just some maintenance and\u2026\u201d\n\nA student interrupts Rosa, raising their hand. \u201cUmm, Rosa? I think someone, uh, wrecked your flowers over there\u2026\u201d The yellow Ankylosaur pointed over to a section of the garden, the damage even visible from this distance. Wincing, I inspect the damage, having been to distracted with my thoughts to notice beforehand. Seems some jokers went around and smashed all of Rosa\u2019s red camellias, leaving the evidence scattered all over. I glance quickly over to Rosa, expecting to see her growing as red as the flowers with indignant rage. Instead she just stands there, her shoulders sagged, her face a picture of misery. \n\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Rosa sniffed, trying to keep her tears at bay. The assembled students shift their feet awkwardly, glancing at one another. Could one of them be the culprit? Glancing back to Rosa, I can tell she\u2019s close to breaking down, too distraught to direct the students. \n\n\u201cHey, uh, why don\u2019t I help you, Rosa?\u201d \n\nGood, someone is stepping up to do the right thing.\nWait.\n\nThat someone is me, the words someone leaving my mouth before I know what I\u2019m doing. For some reason, an image of Principal Spears flashes in my mind as I think about what I just said. The other students turn to stare at me, their surprise evident on their faces. Rosa glances towards me, wiping another tear away as she shoots me a sad smile.\n\n\u201cGracias, An-on. Okay, everyone else, those weeds and vine\u2019s won\u2019t clean themselves! Go, r\u00e1pidio!\u201d Rosa seems to regain a little composure as she shoos the rest of the students to their chores, leaving me standing there alone. Taking another steading breath, Rosa hands me a trowel before collecting her own bag of tools, the both of us setting off over to clean up the damaged flowers. \n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do that, An-on. Ah, lo siento, something in my eyes today\u2026\u201d Scrubbing an arm across her eyes, Rosa laughs slightly, trying to hide her embarrassment. Watching her out of the corner of my eye, I mumble something noncommittal in response, trying not to notice how puffy Rosa\u2019s eyes are. From the looks of them, she\u2019s had something in her eyes all morning. A part of my knows I shouldn\u2019t pry, but something else, a much larger part of me, is dying to make sure she\u2019s okay. \n\nDamn you Spears!\n\n\u201cRosa, are you okay today? You, uh, seem kinda\u2026 I mean, your eyes are\u2026\u201d My words trail off under Rosa\u2019s intense stare as we walk across the pavement of the garden. It didn\u2019t even dawn on my that this may not be something Rosa wanted to share with me, a total stranger she\u2019s only met like one time before, but before I can stammer out an apology, Rosa\u2019s eyes soften, a genuine smile spreading across her face. \n\n\u201cAww, ni\u00f1o, you are so sweet to ask. It\u2019s just\u2026 somethings at home aren\u2019t so good, comprende?\u201d By now we\u2019ve made it to the damaged flowers, petals and stems scattered all over the pavement. Rosa heaves a massive sigh as she surveys the damage. Talking seems to be helping Rosa cope with the destruction of her prized camellias, and I nod for her to continue as we kneel down to begin removing the refuse. \u201cMi familia, they are always worrying about me so much, they always think they can hide when they are hurting \u2026\u201d Rosa trails off, her crimson eyes gazing absently as she collected the remains of the flowers, her hands reverently holding each one before placing it in a pile. I can barely focus on clearing my own section, instead watching Rosa as the words spill out. I can see fresh tears in her eyes.  \n\n\u201cMi Madre, she is the worst! She thinks I don\u2019t notice how thin she is, how her hands shake when she\u2019s in the kitchen.\u201d A sudden sob cuts off the rest of Rosa\u2019s story, and already hot tears are flowing down her face. \u201cI just\u2026 I just want her to be okay, An-on.\u201d \n\nOh geez. \n\nI\u2019m ill equipped to handle this level of real talk, my conversation skills much more attuned to flinging insults on a Finnish butter-churning encyclopedia. A faint memory of my original plan, made when I moved here, flashes across my mind as I move a little closer to Rosa. I put a hand on her shoulder gingerly, and Rosa takes my hand gladly in hers, giving it a squeeze.  \n\nSo much for keeping under the radar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Rosa, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d Before I know it, Rosa has her face buried in my chest, her body shaking with sobs as she holds onto my shoulders with her gloved hands. This close, I can smell her, a pleasant scent of sweat and earth, undercut with a sweet floral smell that must be her shampoo. I move my hands to her back awkwardly, trying to comfort her while also trying not to rake my dirty gloves through her long hair. I can\u2019t help but think notice Rosa really does have some beautiful hair\u2026\n\nUh-oh. Alarms again.\n\n\u201cUmm, Rosa, if you ever want to, ya\u2019know, talk and stuff, I can give you my number and we can text, or something...\u201d\n\nWhatthefuckamIdoingnow.\n\nHiccupping, Rosa pulls away from my chest, and I can already feel a wet spot where her face was pressed. Her horned snoot is wet with snot; her mascara is leaving rivulets of black down her orange face. Her big crimson eyes are bloodshot and puffy from crying, shimmering with tears as she glances up at me. A curious expression lights up her face as she sniffs once more, a mix of sadness, gratitude and\u2026happiness? Rosa flashes me another sad smile, the alarms in my head cranking up in volume.\n\n\u201cOh An-on, you chico tonto\u2026 If you wanted my number, you just had to ask.\u201d Rosa punctuates this with a small laugh, again scrubbing an arm across her eyes. \u201cOh, look at me, soy un desastre! Let me get a tissue\u2026\u201d Rosa turns to fumble around in her bag on her hands and knees, and I try my hardest not to notice just how nice Rosa\u2019s backside looks. I\u2019m supposed to be consoling her, not checking her out! Withdrawing a small packet of tissues, Rosa turns back, uses one to wipe her eyes as she catches her breath. \u201cI\u2019m such a mess today, and \u2013 Oh! \u00a1Dios m\u00edo! An-on, your shirt!\u201d Worry crosses Rosa\u2019s face as she points a gloved finger at my chest. Glancing down, I expected a few wet stains from Rosa\u2019s sobs, nothing that major; instead, her mascara has stained the front of my shirt, goopy black smears covering my chest. \u201cLet me clean it for you, An-on!\u201d\n\nInstinctively, I lean back, away from Rosa\u2019s outthrust tissue. \u201cNo, Rosa, that\u2019s okay, really! I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s nothin \u2013 whoa!\u201d In my haste to back away from Rosa, I had forgotten just how damn clumsy I was, falling over backwards. Expecting to run into my chest, Rosa also pitched herself over, and the both of us fell into a heap, Rosa and I staring face-to-face as she landed chest-first on top of me.\n\nWARNING!!\n\nWE ARE NOW AT DEFCON 1!!\n\nSPAGHETTI OVERLOAD!!\n\nSprawled there, it\u2019s all I can do to look Rosa in the eye as she stares back at me, her bright crimson orbs locked into mine. Desperately, I try not to think about how well Rosa\u2019s chest cushioned her fall, about how the hair spilling over her face is framing her face perfectly, about how close her lips are to mine\u2026. The seconds seem to drag on into infinity as I lie there, Rosa on top of me, feeling her staccato heartbeat matching mine. I can feel my body start to relax slightly, feel my mouth moving almost subconsciously towards Rosa\u2019s, watching through half-closed eyes as Rosa does the same. \n\nUh-oh. \n\nRosa is my friend!\n\nA friend!\n\nWhat about Fang?\n\nWhat ABOUT Fang?\n\n\u201cHey, uh, are you two okay?\u201d\n\nMy eyes snap open in an instant, the question immediately breaking the spell. The same ankylosaur from before is standing above us, their eyebrows raised quizzically, a pear of shears held disinterested in one hand. Rosa pushes herself up, A grunt escaping my lips as she drives her weight into my stomach. She hauls me up with ease, her powerful arms nearly pulling my own out of their sockets. I can see her face turning bright red, the heat coming off of mine letting me know I match her shade for shade. At once we both blather something out, each of us talking over the other.  \n\n\u201cAh!, Si, si, we were just\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI just fell, and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAn-on needed some help getting up and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cRosa just made sure I was okay, uh\u2026\u201d\n\nOur excuses die out as we stand there sheepishly, trying not to catch the other\u2019s eye. The ankylosaur just nods, a sly smile splitting their face as they turn back to their trimming. Awkward seconds tick by as I stand there trying to avoid Rosa\u2019s gaze, surreptitiously glancing her way out of the corner of my eye. She looks a mess; an errant twig is caught in her hair, and her face is still streaked with mascara. But even as I glance at her she does the same to me, the beginnings of a smile curling the corners of her mouth as she does so. Coughing, Rosa turns once again to her bag, her sudden bending over driving my eyes straight up into the sky, my face reddening further. When she turns back, I can see she has her phone with her, a little red flower dangling from the strap. \n\n\u201cUm, c-can I get your number, An-on?\u201d she stammers as she holds her phone out to me, the smile she now sports making her face light up. Taking her phone with a shaky hand, I stammer out something as I punch my name and number into her phone, the default language being set to Spanish making it take slightly longer.\n\n\u201cUh, sure, Rosa. Just text me whenever if you wanna talk\u2026 I mean, if you DO want to, that is, but you don\u2019t have to, uh\u2026\u201d My words trail off as I hand Rosa her phone back, flashing her what I hope is a nervous smile. Her smile deepens as she takes her phone back, our hands touching briefly as she does so. Something about Rosa makes me unable to look away, her deep crimson eyes pulling me further into her. I can sense her kindness in that glance, can feel her love for others in that smile. I want nothing more than to make sure nothing hurts her again. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deal, An-on.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nWhy did that sound like a date?","Title":"Garden Of Rosa","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Rosa, Rosa's Mom, Rosa's Dad, Stella, Reed, Trish, Fang, Naser, Naomi and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Anonymous"},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 10.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 10.txt"],"text":"The Garden of Rosa\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 the tasteful lewd intermezzo \n\nWe reserve this moment to bring you a thought from Anon\u2019s frantic and sex-crazed brain:\n\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\n\nTHERE\u2019S A GIRL IN MY ROOM AND SHE\u2019S GETTING NAKED AND SHE\u2019S ON MY BED AHHHHHHHHHH!\n\nAND SHE\u2019S ON TOP OF ME AND RAPTER JESUS FUCKING CHRIST SHE\u2019S HOT AND SMELLS NICE AHHHHHHH!\n\nThank you. We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.\n\nPinned as I was, with Rosa straddling my waist, it was all I could do but watch as she slowly stripped off her dress, the silky-sheer black slip underneath giving me a tasteful peak at her nudity before it was removed completely. Rosa was wearing the very bra that had jabbed me in the ass the other day, a gorgeous black-and-red silk number embroidered with small flowers. She wore a match set of panties as well; a tasteful number of auburn pubes poking out from the side. Slowly, Rosa reached behind her, unhooking her bra and letting her huge breasts swing free, each of which I seriously doubted would fit in the palm of my hand. They were perfect, large and perky, her paler underbelly striping the majority of them white. Her areola were large, contrasting nicely with her pale scales, each nipple poking out firmly like the buds of a flower.\n\n\u201cOh, mi amor, how I\u2019ve waited for this\u2026\u201d Rosa purred in a low, sultry voice thick with need. My ears did the sensible thing at this moment; redirecting everything they heard away from my brain and directly to my dick. I felt like I was about to explode out of my jeans at this point, erecting a pedestal which Rosa seemed more than happy to sit atop of. Moaning, Rosa leaned down, locking me in a deep kiss as her hands traced the waistband of my pants. A heavy thumping came from behind Rosa, and I could feel the reverberations through the mattress as her thick tail wagged happily on the edge of the bed.\n\n\u201cOowoo, what\u2019s this, mi amor? Do you find me sexy?\u201d Rosa seemed to be enjoying herself at my expense quite a bit, giving me a throaty giggle as she ran her hands down her curves, only a slight shyness in her eyes betraying her sexual bravado. Laying back on the bed, I drank in her little show, watching as her fingers traced every part of her naked body, smiling as Rosa captured my attention like a snake charmer. \u201cMaybe all that love talk was to just get me into bed, eh An-on?\u201d \n\nNo Rosa, it was not.\n\n\nMe and my damn mumbling.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I glanced up from Rosa\u2019s enticing hands that I noticed she was blushing furiously, a shy smile on her face. \u201cAn-on, you really are a hopeless romantic at heart, aren\u2019t you?\u201d We both laughed at that, the mood shifting down somewhat from \u2018unbelievably erotically charged\u2019 to \u2018two horny teenagers getting it on\u2019. Reaching up, I could just about manage pulling Rosa\u2019s head to mine if I propped myself up, locking her in deep kiss as she pulled my belt free at last. We stayed like that as long as we could, our tongues deep inside the other\u2019s mouth, before the cramps in our necks from bending to our respective extremes forced us apart. Rosa paused, her face as red as I\u2019ve ever seen it, hands hooked on the inside of my pants.\n\n\u201cI-I\u2019ve never done this with anyone, mi amor. So if I do something wrong\u2026\u201d Rosa trailed off, looking like she might die from embarrassment. God damn she was cute! Smiling, I took her hands in mine for a moment, giving them the little squeeze that had become our favorite way to communicate.\n\n\u201cRosa, it\u2019s okay. We can go as far as you want. I, uh, haven\u2019t exactly done this either, so\u2026\u201d Now it was my turn for my face to light up. \u201cI\u2019m her for you, mi amor.\u201d The pet name sounded nice as I said it, causing me to break out in a huge grin once more.\n\n\u201cAy, An-on, why do you have to be so cute?! H-here, let me get these off\u2026\u201d Rosa struggled with my jeans, pulling them down awkwardly as she continued to straddle my waist. I helped her pull them the rest of the way off, bucking my hips up off the bed as I did so. Unfortunately, this also rammed my boner right into Rosa\u2019s crotch. Squealing in surprise, Rosa nearly fell onto the floor as she attempted to hop off my lap, managing at the last second to catch herself on the edge of the bed. Rosa just sat there, practically quaking in religious guilt, her face in her hands. Still struggling to extricate myself from my denim prison, I could only admire the cute way her snout stuck out from between her hands.\n\n\u201c\u00a1Ay, demasiado pronto para eso, An-on! Oh, Raptor Jes\u00fas perd\u00f3name\u2026\u201d \n\nI sat up in a flash, moving to wrap my arms around Rosa\u2019s shoulders in comfort. \u201cShit, Rosa I\u2019m sorry! Look, if you\u2019re uncomfortable with this, we can-\u201c\n\n\u201cNo! No, An-on, I-I want to do this! J-just, uh, maybe not THAT yet, mi amor.\u201d Rosa peeked out at me from behind her fingers, her crimson eyes shining. \u201cP-please don\u2019t hate me, mi amor, but no sex, not before we\u2019re married\u2026\u201d Rosa returned my hug, nuzzling her face into my chest. It sounded like she was about to cry.\n\n\u201cRosa, shhh, it\u2019s okay. That\u2019s okay, no sex before marriage.\u201d I agreed, ignoring as my caveman brain screamed out in impotent rage at what my stupid mouth was saying. Stroking Rosa\u2019s hair, I relished the sweet smell of her shampoo, the delicate floral aroma I\u2019ve come to love.  \u201cI know it\u2019s important to you, and, well\u2026 You\u2019re worth waiting for, Rosa.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, so many cheap lines!\u201d Rosa laughed into my chest, pulling just far enough away to place her hands on my chest. \u201cWhatever am I going to do with you\u2026\u201d I let Rosa\u2019s hands push be back onto my elbows, my legs awkwardly crumped beneath me. \u201cWell, let me SHOW you, An-on! No sex before marriage doesn\u2019t mean we can no do anything, si?\u201d Rosa shifts off the bed, pulling my legs off the sides as she sits between them, snagging my pillow for her knees. \u201cJust sit back, mi amor, and enjoy\u2026\u201d \n\n Before I can respond, Rosa quiets me by flashing me a wicked grin as she tugs my boxers down my ankles in one swift motion. She gives another throaty chuckle as my solider springs to attention, moving her face until my shaft lies directly above her. \u201cAy, tan grande, An-on\u2026\u201d She murmurs, nuzzling my nuts with her nose before sliding her long herbivore tongue up my length. I can\u2019t help but moan, letting my head lean back a bit. As Rosa gets to the top, she gives me another kiss before stuffing her mouth, taking all of me easily. \n\n\u201cAh, fuck, Rosa, that\u2019s so good\u2026\u201d I whisper, my hands clenching on the bedsheets as she bobs up and down. This whole time Rosa\u2019s eyes have been locked onto mine, smoldering seductively as she went about wetting my whistle. Pausing to shuffle forward slightly, Rosa takes my hands, interlocking her fingers with mine as she quickens her pace. Holding me freely in her mouth, Rosa has no trouble gulping and sucking me to completion. Despite my efforts to hold out as long as I can, Rosa looks too damn sexy, her hand-holding just too damn cute. \u201cShit, Rosa I\u2019m gonna-\u201c\n\nRosa doesn\u2019t let me finish, instead taking me down to the base as she squeezes my hands. Our little hand-squeeze takes on a whole new meaning this time, and I can almost swear she\u2019s squeezing in rhythm to my pulses. Another loud groan escapes my lips as I writhe against Rosa\u2019s mouth, screwing my eyes shut tight as my wildest dream cums (I couldn\u2019t resist, sorry) true. \n\nI can feel Rosa holding me in her mouth until I finish, still squeezing my hands until the final jolt passes through my legs. Falling down onto the bed with a heavy sigh, I\u2019m content to lie there, boxers around my ankles, panting as Rosa busies herself in the bathroom. After some spitting and a quick rinse with the faucet, Rosa crawls onto the bed next to me, cuddling herself against me. \n\n\u201cW-where\u2026Where did you\u2026learn to do that?\u201d I pant, laying one arm over my eyes as Rosa tucks the other around herself, nuzzling close beside me. Giggling, Rosa just kisses my chest, her tail slowly curling around my leg.\n\n\u201cA dama never kisses and tells, An-on.\u201d Even more kisses are planted on my chest, slowly creeping higher towards my neck, my cheek. \u201cBesides, now it is your turn, mi amor\u2026\u201d Pulling my arm off my face, Rosa plants a kiss on my hand before slowly guiding it down her body. I shift slightly, finding Rosa\u2019s lips with my own as I gently stroke the little tuft of pubes sticking out of her panties. \n\nAlright, time to put all my \/rock-9k\/ knowledge into practice.\n\nSlowly, I gently peel back the silky fabric, all the while keeping my lips locked with Rosa\u2019s. Slipping my hand inside, I can feel the softness of Rosa\u2019s garden as I awkwardly fumble downwards. I try not to focus too much on how clumsy I must feel as I tease and press against Rosa\u2019s clit, especially compared to how expertly Rosa managed to get me off. I can feel how wet Rosa is already as I tease her, every gentle brush across her most sensitive area eliciting a quiet moan from the sexy ankylosaur. Rosa\u2019s body is writhing under my touch, grinding against my hand while also pressing her heaving breasts against my chest. I increase my pace with the understanding that whatever I\u2019m doing must feel good; Rosa\u2019s beginning to squirm so much now, it\u2019s hard to keep my position and still continue our tonsil tango. \n\nFinally, Rosa can\u2019t take it any longer. Breaking our kiss, Rosa lets out a quick staccato of Spanish, reaching down to press my fingers into her harder. My hand is soaking now as I plunge even deeper into her, my fingers pressing parts of Rosa that I\u2019ve never touched before. With one final shriek directly into my ear, Rosa\u2019s back begins to arch, her mouth forming wordless screams as her innermost folds begin to clamp down around my questing digits. Unsure of how long I should keep this up, I inadvertently keep Rosa\u2019s orgasm going to way, way too long, before she collapses into my chest totally and utterly spent, her legs still twitching slightly as she lies motionless on top of me. \n\nGently, I extract my hand from Rosa\u2019s panties, acutely aware of just how slick and moist my fingers have become. Smiling, I lean down to kiss the prone woman\u2019s hair, attempting to no avail to shift my now-numb arm out from under her. I can feel a wet trickle start to form on my chest, where Rosa\u2019s face is currently smushed up against. Wait, is she\u2026 \n\nA soft snore confirms my suspicions. She fell asleep! \n\nI can feel my own eyes begin to droop as I lean down to kiss Rosa\u2019s hair once more. There\u2019s no way I can use this arm, come tomorrow morning. Ah, fuck it; that\u2019s an issue for tomorrow Anon. I close my eyes, deciding that sleeping with Rosa is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me. Pulling the slightly sweat-dampened sheets over us both, I lean back against the mattress, regretting not snagging my pillow from the floor. My muscles don\u2019t even ache anymore as I hug Rosa tightly to me, savoring this moment as long as I can before I drift off to sleep.\n\n\u201cI love you, mi amor.\u201d"},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 11.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 11.txt"],"text":"The Garden of Rosa\n\nChapter 11\n\nA few weeks pass since Rosa and I shared the night at my shitty Skin Row apartment. Apparently, Rosa caught hell from her mom the next morning, and it wasn\u2019t until her dad stepped in with a reminder of what they were doing as high-schoolers that her mom finally cooled down. \n\nThis morning, Principal Spears made an announcement that prom tickets were going on sale, to the excited response of the student body. Truth be told, I was already thinking about asking Rosa. I always thought Prom was pretty lame back at my old school, but not that I was with her\u2026\n\n\u201cOh, si, si An-on! I would love to go to prom with you! \u00a1Aww, eres tan dulce!\u201d Rosa nearly knocked me over when I told her, slamming into my body like a cannonball as she hugged me in the middle of the hallway between classes. In between a hail of kisses and Spanish jubilations, I could make out that Rosa wanted to celebrate me asking her by coming to dinner that night. It was going to be a big family get together, everyone coming over to celebrate something with good food well into the night.\n\n\u201cSure, Rosa, I\u2019d love too.\u201d The thought of facing her mom again makes me a little nervous. But then again, maybe those are just the butterflies in my stomach from seeing Rosa so happy.\n\n\u201c\u00a1Perfecta! Mama is making her famous tlayudas, you\u2019ll love them Anon!\u201d With another squeal of happiness Rosa embraces me once more, burying her face in my chest to muffle her cries. With one final departing kiss, Rosa headed off to class, looking back to wave at me, a grin splitting her face from ear-to-ear. \n\nThe rest of the day passed in a blur. I hardly paid attention to my classes, my thoughts focused instead on that image of Rosa looking so happy. I never noticed that when she smiled like that, her hands pressed against her face and her eyes screwed tight with joy, her mouth formed a perfect heart shape against her snout. That was a smile worth protecting, for sure.\n\nI managed to find the least wrinkled outfit I could for tonight\u2019s dinner. Rosa agreed to pick me up at my apartment, the logic being that hopefully we wouldn\u2019t be there long enough for anyone to try and jack her car. Knowing her, she\u2019d probably just give them a taste of her dreaded chancla. A text from her lets me know she\u2019s waiting outside, interrupting the browsing of my favorite Ukrainian salad-baking image blog. I figured I needed some calming down today, and shit-posting was just the way to do it.  \n\nRosa greets me with a kiss as I slide into the passenger side of her car. \u201c\u00a1Ay, hola An-on! You excited for tonight?\u201d I can tell she\u2019s excited for me to meet her whole family this time.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 A little nervous meeting everyone, ya\u2019know?\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, mi amor don\u2019t be silly, they will love you! Besides, Papi has already calmed Mama down, she does not hate you anymore.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m not sure that was supposed to be a joke.\n\nWe make small talk as she speeds out of town, past the suburbs and into the surrounding greenbelt that marks her family\u2019s farm. I can feel the butterflies in my stomach starting to turn into fully-fledge birds as we pull down the gravel drive of her house. Nearly every light is on inside, and loud up-beat Latin pop is pulsating into the night. There\u2019s several more cars in the open-air garage than before, and Rosa has to part a little bit aways from the house. Taking my hand when we get out, Rosa pulls me along excitedly, her infectious laughter helping to settle my nerves.\n\nThe inside of the house is packed with people. The familiar coloring of Rosa\u2019s family is evident on several of the ankylosaurus inside, but there are also a few others, presumably friends of the family or distant cousins. Rosa keeps a tight hold of my hand as she shows me off to everyone, unable to keep from beaming when she introduces me as her \u2018novio\u2019. I find I\u2019m beaming just as much as she is, too.\n\nEveryone in Rosa\u2019s extended family greets me with a friendly nod or a shake of the hand, clearly not too surprised that their little Rosa is dating a human. I assume her parents probably got the word out when I first came over. The only ones who seemed a little wary of me were Rosa\u2019s brothers: Each of them were huge guys, muscles gained from working in the family fields on full display in tank-tops and baggy shorts. Some even had tattoos on their scales, crosses and depictions of Raptor Jesus rubbing shoulder-to-shoulder to half-naked dinos and skulls and who knows what else. \n\nEventually, I\u2019m whisked through the whirlwind of distant relations until I find myself deposited at the dining table, where Rosa\u2019s dad is entertaining some friends with a raucous story. \u201cI need to go help Mama with the cooking, An-on. It will just be un momento, I promise.\u201d Rosa gives me another peck on the cheek before disappearing into the kitchen. Catching my eye, Rosa\u2019s dad politely excuses himself, greeting me with another firm handshake.\n\n\u201cAn-on, glad you could make it! I see you\u2019ve meet el familia.\u201d Rosa\u2019s dad smiles at a passing relative, gladly accepting the beer offered to him. He practically rips open the bottle with his palm, no doubt not feeling a thing.\n\n\u201cY-yeah, everyone\u2019s been great.\u201d I have to raise my voice over the din of the party. The butterflies in my stomach are back, now; the sight of Rosa\u2019s dad seemingly increasing their intensity.\n\n\u201cAyy, they\u2019re all good people. Say, An-on, come out to the deck with me, we can talk, de hombre a hombre.\u201d The pat on my back nearly pitches me forwards as Rosa\u2019s dad leads me past the guests, winding another room of the house until we reach the back door.\n\nRosa\u2019s dad takes me outside, onto a large wooden deck complete with a handsome wooden railing. A few lounge chairs are positioned next to a large grill, presumably used for their vegetarian grilling, as sad as that sounds to me. Mercifully, the deck is free from any other relatives or party guests, leaving the two of us alone. The noise of the party is muffled slightly as Rosa\u2019s dad slides the glass door shut. Leaning against the railing of the reck, adjusting his ever-present trucker hat as he stares out into the distance. Their home has a majestic view of the rolling hills that surround Volcaldera, the peace and beauty of the countryside on full display. I join him at the railing, the two of us staring at sunset.\n\n\u201cAhh, nothing greater than God\u2019s work, eh An-on?\u201d Rosa\u2019s dad takes a swig of his beer, his eyes studying the label as he fidgets with the bottle. I nod along, content to remain silent for the moment. This seems like the beginning of a lecture, with the way he\u2019s acting. \u201cAn-on, you and Rosa have been together for what, a few months now?\u201d\n\nAh, there it is. Maybe being out here alone isn\u2019t such a good idea.\n\n\u201cYessir, sounds about right. Seems like a lot longer, to be honest.\u201d I drum my hands awkwardly on the wooden railing, wishing I also had a beer to fidget with.\n\n\u201cDo you\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s dad clears his throat before starting again. \u201cDo you think about your future together? A good young man like yourself, together with my daughter. I\u2019ve never seen Rosa look so happy, An-on, and you should be proud of that.\u201d \n\n\u201cUh, thank you, sir.\u201d I was expecting an upbraiding for Rosa\u2019s overnight visit, no matter what Rosa had said to the contrary. Father\u2019s didn\u2019t like their daughters spending the night at their boyfriends, especially when Raptor Jesus was supposed to be the only man for her.\n\nRosa\u2019s dad takes another long pull at his beer before continuing. \u201cBut happiness, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s always going to be there, si? You have to work at it, work together at making it last.\u201d Another swig of the bottle. I realize this may not be his first beer tonight. \u201cWhen my wife got sick\u2026\u201d His voice cracks a bit, forcing him to pause before continuing. I\u2019ve never seen him so emotional before. Yep, definitely not his first beer. \u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t get through it. But she wouldn\u2019t let me, you know? I wanted so much to curl up and cry. She, she just looked me in the eyes and said \u2018Guillermo, we can do this.\u2019\u201d He let his words hang in the air for a moment, the sounds of the party drifting through the sliding door. Sighing, Rosa\u2019s dad scratched his head for moment. \u201cRosa is like her mother, she cares about people. But sometimes, she don\u2019t know when to focus on herself! But you, An-on, you make her happy, make her shine!\u201d His hands grasp the air, as if he was trying to hold onto his last sober thoughts. Bahhh, I guess what I\u2019m trying to say, An-on, is-\u201c\n\n\u201cSir, I want to marry Rosa.\u201d\n\nThose words had been building up inside me for a while now, those butterflies. The more and more I listened to Rosa\u2019s dad ramble on, the more I knew that I wanted to admit it, wanted to speak those thoughts that I was afraid of. I had to say it, say I wanted to marry Rosa, because if I didn\u2019t the desire to say it was going to make me explode.\n\nRosa\u2019s dad just stared at me, his red eyes wide with shock. I felt like a balloon; all the air inside of me, all the feelings I had towards Rosa were finally coming out, and no one could stop it. I realized my hands were shaking, realized that I probably sounded like some dumb kid to him. I didn\u2019t even know what I was saying, really. Hell, I don\u2019t even know how much a ring would cost!\n\n\u201cI want to marry your daughter,\u201d I repeated, starting Rosa\u2019s dad straight in the eye. Forcing the words out helped elevate the pressure I could feel building deep inside. \u201cI know I\u2019m young, and I don\u2019t have a lot of money, or a job, or, or anything like that. But I love her, sir. God, I love her so much that the idea of not being with her hurts inside. We\u2019ll make it work, I just know it.\u201d I expected Rosa\u2019s dad to say something by now, anything. His protracted silence did not seem like a good sign. \u201cAnd like you said, you were married when you were not much ol-\u201c\n\nMy words are cut off at once. Rosa\u2019s dad has collected me into a bone-crushing hug, a look of pure joy creasing his face. His words come out in a flood of barely understandable Spanish, but given that he\u2019s not actively trying to strangle me right now, I assume they\u2019re words of encouragement. The massive ankylosaur finally lets me go, grinning down at me as he claps me on the shoulder with a massive, callused hand.\n\n\u201cAn-on, you magnificent little chico! Aw, you two are going to be so happy together!\u201d I knew Rosa\u2019s dad liked to wear his emotions on his sleeve, but I\u2019m a little uncomfortable with this level of expression from a man who could fold me in half like a chair. \u201cBesides, once you two are married, you can start making me some nietas and nietos, si?\u201d Laughing, he pounds me on the back again, throwing his arm around me as he steers me back into the house. I make a mental note to ask Rosa what \u2018nietas\u2019 and \u2018nietos\u2019 are, but a part of me already knows. As Rosa\u2019s dad invertedly strangles me, I manage to croak out one final thought before we rejoin the party.  \n\n\u201cJust keep it a secret from Rosa, okay?\u201d "},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 12.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 12.txt"],"text":"The Garden of Rosa \n\nChapter 12\n\nA few weeks have passed since I blurted out my desire to marry Rosa to her dad. Luckily, I managed to make it through the party that night without saying anything else stupid, although I did have to lie to Rosa about why her dad burst into drunken weeping whenever he saw her for the rest of the night. Her mom still glared whenever she looked at me, but whether or not that was a good or bad thing I couldn\u2019t figure out. Under that ever-watchful mom glare, I planted only a chaste kiss on Rosa\u2019 cheek when it was time to go, content to call a taxi back to Skin Row. \n\nRosa and I have been spending nearly every day together since then, hanging out with either Stella or the gang. Fang made amends with Trish and Reed, and the three of them have been practicing non-stop. It seems Spears approached Fang about getting VVURM DRAMA to play at the prom, and they\u2019ve been preparing all new material to debut. I was glad that Fang reconciled with Trish; she seemed happier than she had been in a while after doing so, and it seemed our talk in the band room helped ease her mind about us as well. It was awkward between Trish and I at first, but the two of us agreed not to get in each other\u2019s way. Although, Trish did nearly try and kill me when I asked if they were going to stick with a guitar and bass, lowering her horns towards my way as Fang and Reed laughed their asses off. \n\nSome things just never change, I guess.\n\nOne thing continued to dominate my thoughts, however: Prom. With prom right around the corner, the school was positively buzzing in anticipation. My old man promised to send me his old tux by the end of the week, saving me a few extra bucks. A good thing, too; prom tickets weren\u2019t cheap, and I was trying to scrape and save every penny I could. Thankfully, Fang wasn\u2019t concerned about finding a date, that topic having grown slightly awkward between us, and she was content to go as a group with Reed and Trish. Hell, even Stella had managed to find a date, although no matter how much Rosa and I pried, she wouldn\u2019t tell us who it was. \n\n\u201cAww, Stella, please tell us! I promise no to judge him, or even if it\u2019s a\u2026 a s-she.\u201d Rosa was taking another stab at getting it out of Stella today, though, the three of us walking to the parking lot after school. There were still some things Rosa\u2019s faith wouldn\u2019t budge on, however risqu\u00e9 our frequent meetings had become. \u201cOh, is it that guy from science class? The one who you did a reading for the other day? He\u2019s cute, Stella.\u201d Rosa nudged Stella in the ribs, sticking her long tongue out at me as she did so. Forcing a smile, I tried not to let my face get too red.\n\n\u201cUgh, Rosa, I told you, no hints before prom!\u201d Rolling her eyes, Stella pointedly turned back to her manga, a picture of two waifish boys dangerous close to one another plastered on the covers. How she managed to read while walking I will never understand. Stella had been fending off Rosa all day, and by the way she buried her face in those pages, she was close to the end of her rope. \u201cD-don\u2019t you and Anon have, like, a date or something to get to?!\u201d \n\nAh, our date. I\u2019d been planning it for a few days now; a leisurely stroll through the city arboretum. With how much Rosa loves gardening, I was surprised when she mentioned she\u2019d never been before. Plus, it was free for students. A win-win.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s right, Rosa, we should get going if we wanna hit the arboretum. It usually fills up around this time.\u201d I gently drag the still guessing Rosa away from Stella, leaving the lemon-lime stego buried in what no doubt was some sort of softcore yaoi. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch you later Stella!\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, si, si. Stella, I will see you tomorrow, yes? Oh! Is it that chico from the football team?\u201d Rosa shouted over her shoulder as I pulled her towards her car, the two of us stifling our laughter. By the way Stella\u2019s tail curled around her leg, I think Rosa might have been right on that one. \n\n***\n\nThe trip across town to the arboretum was pleasant enough. I had even started to like some of the Latin music Rosa played, although the more pop-hits I had to grimace to get through. Rosa was an absolute treat today; singing along as she drove, tapping her fingers to the beat of the music. I couldn\u2019t help but watch, thanking whatever fates Stella believed in for putting the two of us together. \n\nA little while later, Rosa pulls into the arboretum parking lot, row upon row filled with cars. Just what I was afraid of\u2026\u201c\u00bfAy, Cu\u00e1ntos carros hay ah\u00ed?\u201d This is the second time we\u2019ve looped around the parking lot, and Rosa\u2019s patience is beginning to crack. I haven\u2019t seen her like this since I fell into the flowers at school: Her snout is screwed up in a frown, her eyes narrowed. \n\n\u201cMaybe we can get street parking?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo! We\u2019ve been here long enough, we are getting a spot!\u201d I hold my hands up, palms out as Rosa\u2019s anger flashes. I forget how bossy Rosa can be, sometimes.\n\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s one!\u201d My hand flies towards the one empty spot in the parking lot. It\u2019s even close to the entrance! Even as I point it out to Rosa, a black sports-car comes up the other side of the lane, already closer to the spot than we are. There\u2019s no way we could make it there before he does. I let my arm sag, my heart quickly joining it. \u201cAw jeez, that asshole\u2019s gonna take it.\u201d\n\nRosa\u2019s fist hammers on the steering wheel, causing me to jump. \u201cNO! \u00a1Eso es suficiente! No gilipollas is going to take my spot! Ay, let\u2019s see how you like this, eh?\u201d I can see my life flash before my eyes as Rosa guns it, narrowly cutting off the other car as she managed to claim the spot first. Nodding to herself with a look of smug self-satisfaction, Rosa steps out of the car, pointedly not looking at the other car as they drive off. I, meanwhile, still cling to the dashboard, willing my nerves to settle down. Rosa missed the car on the passenger side by an inch. \n\nBarely managing to shimmy out of the car, and having to hold my door as to not slam into the car next to us, I finally manage to climb out after Rosa. Rosa still sports her bossiest face as she waits for me to extract myself, tapping her foot impatiently. Just as I finally burst free, Rosa grabs me by the hand, hauling me in the direction of the entrance, tail lashing back and forth angrily. \u201cCome on, mi amor, let\u2019s go.\u201d It feels like she\u2019s going to rip my arm out of my shoulder!\n\n \u201cYes ma\u2019am!\u201d Rosa\u2019s face quiets any further facetious conversation as we wait in the short line of people to enter the park. Flashing our student I.D\u2019s at the pimply-faced dino manning the tiller, we dislodge ourselves from the crowd, Rosa finally calming down. Pulling a hand-mirror out of her purse, Rosa begins adjusting her hair, raking back any loose auburn strands with her fingers. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re kinda cute when you get anger, Rosa.\u201d\n\nRosa\u2019s face blossoms a crimson red, the heat of her face nearly matching her eyes. Snapping the mirror shut, she languishes me under a torrent of rapid Spanish, alternating between wagging her finger and gesturing with her whole hand at me. \u201c\u00a1No estoy enojada! Ese gilipollas iba a tomar el lugar\u2026\u201d\n\nI let her vent, hiding my smile as we walk through the arboretum gates. Different paths branch out in front of us, a map standing nearby to guide visitors to specific locations in the park. By the way Rosa\u2019s voice is slowly creeping up the octaves, she\u2019s not quite over the altercation in the parking lot. Glancing over to her, I can see her miming a steering wheel, her hand-motions no doubt proving once and for all that she was in the right. It\u2019s a gamble, but I know one surefire way to sooth her nerves\u2026 \n\n\u201cMan, our kids are going to have to watch out, or their sexy mamacita is going to let them have it!\u201d I start down one of the paths at random, leaving Rosa struck dumbfounded for a moment before she launches after me. Laughing, I run for my life down the path. I may pay for that comment later, but seeing the look of shock on her face is well worth it.\n\n\u201cAn-on! Chico estupido, how could you say that?!\u201d She cries, quickly gaining on me. I submit to her tackle, Rosa\u2019s strong arms wrapping around my middle and pulling me into a hug. She\u2019s laughing now as well. \u201cDo you\u2026 Do you really think about that? Our children, I mean.\u201d Her fingers intertwine with mine as we settle into a stroll, taking in the arboretum sights around us. Trees tower over us, little plaques carefully displayed at their base informing us of their names. Rosa seems to be enjoying herself, \u2018oohing\u2019 and \u2018ahhing\u2019 over the sights: It looks like any other park, to me. \n\n\u201cOf course I do, mi amor.\u201d Smiling, I plant a quick peck on Rosa\u2019s head, momentarily breathing in the smell of her hair. Rosa\u2019s eyes are still tracing along the foliage, but her blush has returned, accompanied by a shy smile. She gives my hand another squeeze, letting me know in her own way that she thinks about our kids as well.\n\n***\n\nRosa and I end up spending the whole afternoon at the arboretum. Honestly, I didn\u2019t even know there were that many different types of trees, but nevertheless Rosa pointed out each different species to me, her voice chittering with excitement. It seems Rosa not only had a knack for gardening, but botany as well, correctly identifying many of the species even before she read the little plaque beneath it. Eventually, we found ourselves underneath a gazebo, overlooking the arboretum\u2019s field of indigenous wildflowers. A gently spring breeze had started, rippling the multicolored flowers like a blanket. Even I had to admit it was a pretty nice sight.\n\n\u201cSo where did you learn about all that? The different types of plants, and their names and stuff.\u201d My voice interrupts our shared silent moment, the only other sound the soft rustle of wildflowers. Rosa\u2019s head rests on my shoulder, her arms wrapping around my own as we relax on one of the gazebo\u2019s benches.\n\n\u201cPapi helped teach me, in the beginning. He said I had a green thumb, that I was a natural at the natural.\u201d Rosa laughs at her own joke, I can\u2019t help but snort a little. \u201cFrom there, I did some independent study on my own, and the community college had some classes I could take. Why, did you think I was just some dumb jardinera?\u201d Rosa glances up at me, her crimson eyes flashing definitely. \n\n\u201cNo. no. I was just wondering, is all. I didn\u2019t think Volcano High had any sort of program like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm, you\u2019d be surprised by what you find, mi amor, when you\u2019re not trying to skip class.\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice is playful, teasing. The way she rubs my arm lets me know there\u2019s no chastisement in her comment.\n\n\u201cUgh, but it\u2019s soooo boring!\u201d I let out an exaggerated sigh, letting my head sag back over the bench. \u201cNot fair that you got to choose your classes; they stuck me with half of mine in when I moved here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAww, my poor amor!\u201d Rosa giggled, moving my arm so she could lay her head in my lap. Careful of her horns, I began stroking her hair, the two of us still staring off into the sea of flowers. \u201cYou could\u2019ve swapped classes, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd make them think I care? Nah, I\u2019m happy where I am.\u201d I sneak a peek down at Rosa, watching her stare out at the horizon. She\u2019s no longer smiling, now. \u201cUh, something I said?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you are\u2026 \u201c The words are quiet, half-mumbled under Rosa\u2019s breath. \u201cAn-on,\u201d Rosa continues in a louder voice, suddenly serious. \u201cWhat are you going to do after we graduate? Do you really have to leave, like your padre said?\u201d \n\nThe voice of my old man runs through my mind. \u2018College or the service; I don\u2019t care which.\u2019 Up until now, I hadn\u2019t really thought about it too much. Before Rosa, nothing had really tied me down to Volcaldera, nothing had made me want to stay in my adoptive home. But now I felt like a balloon drifting in the wind, secured to Rosa only by a slim thread. Could I even stay, if I wanted to?\n\n\u201cWhere will you go, Rosa?\u201d I try and dodge her question, hoping she may provide me the answers I was looking for myself. Rosa just shakes her head on my lap, her beautiful crimson eyes failing to meet my own.\n\n\u201cPapa said I could work on the farm if I wanted. Just like my hermanos did. But\u2026\u201d There\u2019s hesitation in her voice. Rosa bites her lower lip, the worry she must be feeling evident on her face. \u201cThere\u2019s a college that has an accelerated program, where you can learn all about these.\u201d Rosa waved her hand towards the fields of wildflowers shimmering in the wind. \u201cAbout conservation and protection and everything else. Half of these flowers are endangered, An-on, endangered because we keep clearing them out for more farmland.\u201d Her hand slumps back to her chest where I take hold of it, squeezing her tightly. \u201cIt costs money, though, money we don\u2019t have now that Mama is sick. But I can\u2019t just sit by and let something I love slowly fade away. An-on, if I could help save them, then maybe, maybe Mama could\u2026\u201d \n\nRosa\u2019s voice breaks down, cracking under the strain. She begins to sob, covering her face with her hands. I pull Rosa awkwardly to my chest, cradling her in my arms and murmuring words of comfort into her auburn hair. Reflecting on all the times I\u2019ve held her close, whispered words of love and affection to her, I realize that in all that time Rosa\u2019s never asked me to be anything I wasn\u2019t, never asked or expected me to comfort her and make all her fears disappear. Rosa has always just accepted me for me, accepted my words of support and never once asked for anything more. And now, as she sobbed against my chest, I felt like my words weren\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cRosa, you asked what I wanted to do after we graduate. Well, this is what I want to do: I want to be with you Rosa, no matter what my old man says. I want to support you, to love you, to watch you grow into the beautiful woman I know you can be. And if that means staying here in Volcaldera and getting my own job, or moving away with you to college, or, or finding some other way for us to be together, well so be it.\u201d After a time, Rosa pulls away, wiping her eyes on the backs of her hands. Tilting her face up towards mine, I gaze into her eyes, those deep crimson pools so full of love that I feel like I could drown in them. \n\n\u201cAn-on, I\u2019m scared. Scared that she\u2019s not going to get better, that I can\u2019t do anything for her. It tears me up inside, not being able to help mi madre. And when I think of leaving to go to school I feel so guilty! What if something happens when I\u2019m gone, An-on?\u201d I press her gently back to me, leaning down to wrap Rosa in a hug. Her hands grip my back, nails digging into my jacket.\n\n\u201cI know, Rosa. But what she wants, what I want, is for you to be happy. Whatever that means, we\u2019ll both be there, supporting you, loving you, no matter what.\u201d\n\nRosa slowly shuffles up into a seated position, pulling her legs up to the chest and wrapping her arms around them. Snuffling, she wipes her tears off with the back of her hand, her voice husky. \u201cGracias, An-on, for that. It means a lot, coming from mi amor. Dios Mio, I\u2019m always crying now. I swear, I used to no do that.\u201d Rosa barks a sad laugh, leaning her head once more on my shoulder. Together, we watch as the wind ripples over the sea of wildflowers, watching as those fragile flowers bend against the breeze.\n\n\u201cSometimes, crying is exactly what we need.\u201d"},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 13.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 13.txt"],"text":"Chapter 13\n\nTonight is the big night: Prom. The stuffiness of the cab reduces me to a puddle of sweat in a cheap suit, but I don\u2019t dare roll the windows down. It already took a bit of mending to get Dad\u2019s old tux up to snuff, and I don\u2019t want to ruin it with the dust from Rosa\u2019s gravel drive. Bad enough I couldn\u2019t catch a ride with Stella out here. Gritting my teeth against the heat, I swore nothing was going to spoil this night for us.\n\nHanding the cabbie the fare, I try to ignore his smug smile and comments about how best to avoid prom night disasters as I exit the yellow sweatbox. Rosa\u2019s house is already busy, and I spot Stella\u2019s car among the many parked in the open-air garage. She graciously offered to be our ride for tonight, although I think it was just so she can show off her prom date to the both of us; when Stella blurted out that it was the star player of the football team, our mouths nearly hit the floor. Knocking on the front door, I could hear familiar voices inside quiet somewhat as someone rushed to answer; it seemed most of Rosa\u2019s family was over once more to see us off. Rosa\u2019s dad opened the door, greeting me with a smile and a thunderous pounding on my back.\n\n\u201cAy, An-on, welcome, welcome! Make yourself at home: Stella and her novio are in the kitchen, helping la esposa with the last of the food.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe food?\u201d I ask, carefully pulling out the corsage I had procured for Rosa from my jacket pocket. Thank you, five-finger discount\u2026\n\n\u201cSi, Rosa and her madre were making food for the prom! Seemed there was a last-minute cancelation and my little Bebita jumped at the opportunity.\u201d Rosa\u2019s dad beamed with fatherly pride as he ushered me into the kitchen where Stella and her tank of a date were waiting. \u201cAh, what a sweet kid\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet, who is stuck here finishing all of the food, eh?\u201d Rosa\u2019s mom gave me a welcoming smile and wave from behind the mountain of take-out containers she was filling. \u201cAnon, good to see you. Grab a spoon and start filling.\u201d Several other realatives greeted me from their own spots around the kitchen, a veritable production-line of food preparation spanning the generations of Rosa\u2019s family.\n\nRolling up my sleeves, I started loading up the delicious-smelling food into the various plastic and Styrofoam containers. From the sheer volume of food, I wondered if there would even be room in Stella\u2019s car for the four of us, not to mention the size of the lad Stella was with. Jeez, what an absolute unit. I chatted with Stella as we filled, scooped and ladled, passing the time by complementing her on her dress and hair.\n\n\u201cThanks Anon! Ohmygosh, wait to you see Rosa, she is soooooo cute!\u201d Stella\u2019s bubbly demeanor did little to quell my own nervousness. God, I hope I looked good enough for Rosa\u2026 \u201cDid\u2019ja know she made her own dress?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look pretty good too, babe.\u201d Despite his enormous size, Stella\u2019s date spoke with a careful, almost shy voice. Stella blushed under his attention, and when no one but me was looking, reached over to pinch his bottom! \n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t have to wait long , eh? An-on, here she comes!\u201d Rosa\u2019s dad tapped me on the shoulder, directing me to the hall where Rosa\u2019s room lay. Washing my hands quickly, I eagerly awaited Rosa\u2019s arrival at the kitchen entrance, trying to sooth my nerves by straightening my bow-tie. The sound of the door opening heralded Rosa\u2019s arrival, and then\u2026\n\n\u201cHola, An-on! So, how do I look?\u201d \n\nSimply put, Rosa looked stunning: Her dress was magnificent, the huge ruffled skirt resembling an enormous rose in full bloom. The bodice of her dress fit her snugly, vines of roses wrapping around the tight white silk only helping to accentuate Rosa\u2019s curves and plunging cleavage. Rosa\u2019s hair was laced with what looked like drops of starlight, shimmering in the light of the hallway as she twirled around. \u201cMama helped me make it. Isn\u2019t it lovely, the way it flows! Oh, and the flowers!\u201d Rosa ran her hands down her body, clearly pleased with the work she had done.\n\n\u201cI think Anon likes it very much, Rosa.\u201d The voice of Rosa\u2019s mom directly behind me snapped me out of my ogling, reminding me to put my eyes on Rosa\u2019s face, not the rest of her. Under her mom\u2019s watchful glare, I pinned Rosa\u2019s corsage to her wrist, feeling myself going pale as Rosa hugged me. God, the way her dress lifted her chest\u2026\n\u201cAhem!\u201d Rosa\u2019s mom grinned wickedly at the two of us, wielding a digital camera and about a dozen additional SD cards. We both groaned, sharing a look of universal childhood exasperation. \u201cCome on you two, it\u2019s time for pictures.\u201d \n\n***\n\nSomehow, the four of us had managed to fit into Stella\u2019s car, along with about a ton of homemade food. After a considerable time, we managed to finally unload our precious cargo, hauling it inside. Chinese lanterns dotted the celling, matching the decorations that we saw outside, giving the entire prom a decided Far-East look. Glancing over to where the buffet table had been set up, I could indeed tell that it was empty, whatever catering company that had been hired clearly leaving the school high and dry at the last minute. As the smell of the food wafted before us, dozens of hungry students began to crowd around, licking their lips in anticipation. Eyeing the crowd, I didn\u2019t see any sign of Fang or Reed. I really needed to talk to them before\u2026\n\n\u201cRosa? Rosa!\u201d The bellowing voice of Principal Spears rose over the up-tempo music of the gymnasium, dulling the excited chatter of the crowd. I could see Spears heading towards us, cutting through the assembled students like some great white shark dispersing lesser, more hungry fish. I manage a nod towards the hulking man in greeting, laboring under about a dozen heavy trays of food.\n\n\u201cEvening, Principal Spears.\u201d \n\n\u201cHola, Principal Spears! Sorry we were late, mi madre had us taking more pictures than I thought.\u201d Rosa began handing Spears tray after tray of delicious food she has painstaking prepared. She mentioned in the car that she had been cooking since yesterday evening! All that work, just to feed her fellow students. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad you came when you did, Rosa. Here, let me help you set up the food.\u201d Spears took my own trays as well, clearly having no issue handling an amount of food that probably weighed as much as I did. \u201cI was afraid we were going to have a riot on our hands if these kids didn\u2019t get something to eat soon.\u201d Spears turns back into the crowd, several pairs of hungry eyes following him intently. \u201cRosa, do you mind helping me set these out?\u201d\n\n\u201cLo siento, An-on, but I\u2019ll just be a moment, okay?\u201d Rosa gives me a peck on the cheek, collecting the remaining trays in her arms. \u201cGo enjoy yourself! Maybe you can go say hi to Fang for me?\u201d \n\n\u201cSure, don\u2019t worry about it, Rosa.\u201d She gives me another smile before heading off to join Spears at the catering table. I couldn\u2019t help but get an eyeful of Rosa\u2019s low-cut back as she sauntered away, her high-heels giving her already ample backside another boost. Damn, she really looks radiant in that dress\u2026 \nChuckling, I scan the crowd once more, trying to find Fang. I hoped to catch her before the band starts playing, and I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s not among the ravenous students mobbing the buffet station. However, something else catches my eye, however; a sad little purple figure alone at a table in the back, blankly staring at her phone. Trish looks absolutely miserable, her sad face clashing with her sparkling black dress and golden horn ornaments. I thought her and Fang had reconciled? Something clearly was on her mind, with the way she was pouting, all alone.\n\nUgh, I didn\u2019t feel like playing therapist again, especially at prom.\n\n***\n\nSeveral slow songs later, I return to the table where Trish and I talked, grateful there was still some food left at the buffet. Dancing with Trish was\u2026 nice, even if she was upset. Turns out, there was a last-minute set-list change, one that Trish did not like in the slightly. She said she was feeling pushed out of her own band, but I think she just needed a comforting shoulder for a while, someone who would listen as she blew off some steam.\n\nMunching away at Rosa\u2019s homecooked food, I once again scanned the crowd, this time for signs of my girlfriend. I hadn\u2019t seen her since she and Spears went off to set up the food, and I hoped she hadn\u2019t been mobbed by the hungry pack of teenagers that descended on the buffet table. Getting an impromptu dance lesson from Trish was great and all, but I really wanted to spend the rest of prom with the girl who I came with. \n\nWith no Latina ankylosaur in sight, I resigned myself to the food once more, the sappy sad love song currently blasting out onto the dance floor only making my heart sink further. I fumbled out my phone, fingers automatically moving to text Rosa before I remembered that there were no pockets in that dress of hers, and her purse was at the coat check. Damnit, where could she be?\n\n\u201cGuess who, mi amor?\u201d Almost as if by request, a pair of gentle hands cover my eyes from behind. This close, I could smell Rosa\u2019s perfume, the sweet scent banishing all my previous insecurities. Rosa\u2019s hands moved to my shoulders as she leaned down towards me, greeting me with a kiss before taking the seat next to me. \n\n\u201cAy, sorry An-on, it was a madhouse over there! It took Spears and I a while to restore order, and I do no think those pinche gringos liked waiting in line.\u201d Rosa tucked an errant strand of hair behind her ear, adjusting the bodice of her dress with the other hand as she did so. \u201cI swear, if one more imb\u00e9cil so much as thinks of\u2026 What? An-on, what is it?\u201d\n\nI realize I had been staring at Rosa this whole time, a goofy smile creeping up my face. But how could I not? The way her face shone slightly with sweat, the way her hair shimmered in the light: Rosa was probably the most beautiful girl at the prom tonight. Without a doubt the most beautiful person in my life, anyways.\n\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s nothing. Come on, let\u2019s dance!\u201d Before Rosa could protest, I pulled her up, leading her by both hands to the dance floor. We found a space easily, and just as Trish taught me earlier, I settled my hand around Rosa\u2019s waist, taking her hand in mine. Position assumed, we began to dance, my slow, careful movements leading Rosa\u2019s more practiced steps. Rosa\u2019s crimson eyes bored into me, her smoky eyeshadow only enhancing how gorgeous she looked. Now, that sappy love song didn\u2019t sound so bad.\n\nThe first song eventually faded away, replaced by a slightly faster, but equally sappy, pop number. Rosa followed my lead, our feet sashaying across our space on the dance floor. Unlike before, where Trish and I had talked while we danced, Rosa and I danced in silence, enjoying one another\u2019s company for the first time tonight. I could feel myself beginning to redden as Rosa and I stared at each other, giggling, the pure happiness we both felt spreading across our faces.\n\n\u201cAn-on, you\u2019re pretty good at this!\u201d Rosa said as we continued into the third song, giving my hand a squeeze as we slowly rotated in tune with the music. I was careful to shuffle my feet, making sure not to step on any part of Rosa\u2019s voluminous dress. \u201cYou know, Papi said I would always end up with a man who knew how to dance. \u201c\n\n\u201cAh, well, you can thank Trish for that.\u201d  Rosa and I got closer, the petal-like ruffles of her dress swishing against my pants.  \u201cShe uh\u2026 She kinda\u2019 had to teach me tonight.\u201d I let my hand explore the smoothness of Rosa\u2019s dress, brushing her bare skin ever so slightly as I did so. The beginnings of a frown start to crease Rosa\u2019s brow, her smile turning sour.\n\n\u201cAww, I didn\u2019t get your first dance?\u201d\u201d Rosa\u2019s pouting only enhanced her beauty, but from the way her brows were starting to knit together, I knew a tirade was beginning to form. Students glanced our way as Rosa\u2019s voice took on more heat. \u201cI was looking forward to that. Did Trish plan this, hmmm? Trying to steal you away, that maldita peque\u00f1a purpura-mmpf!\u201d I cut Rosa off with a kiss, pressing her into my body as I did so. I kept the kiss quick, pulling back nearly as quickly as I had started, leaving Rosa confused and breathless. \u201cAy, you chico tonto!\u201d What was that for?\u201d\n\nSmiling, I continued swaying to the music. Nothing was going to spoil this moment for us. \u201cBecause! Nothing is going to make you sad tonight, Rosa. I won\u2019t allow it. And no, Trish did not steal me away,\u201d I continued, laughing as Rosa blushed slightly with jealousy. \u201cTonight, you deserve to be the happiest woman in the world, and I\u2019m going to do everything to make sure it-mmpf!\n\nIt was Rosa\u2019s turn to take me by surprise, moving her hand from my shoulder to the back of my head to pull me down into her. Her kiss was tender at first, almost like the first kiss we shared, but soon it grew more and more intense, feeding off our passion. Rosa\u2019s tongue slipped hesitantly into my mouth as the kiss continued, slowly teasing my teeth before sloppily rolling around my mouth. I couldn\u2019t say how we danced like that, bodies pressed against one another, mouths locked in love\u2019s eternal embrace, but it wasn\u2019t until a ripple of chatter spread through the students that either of us noticed the music had stopped.\n\nBlushing, the two of us broke apart, trying not to meet the eyes of the students around us as Spears took the stage. For once, the enormous man held a microphone, his massive hand easily dwarfing the small object. Rosa and I stood there; our little fingers hooked together as Spears began his announcement.\n\n\u201cGood evening Volcano High!\u201d Spears paused, letting the assembled students cheer. Rosa even added her own trilling exultation to the mix. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few announcements before we end tonight, and you all go home safely.\u201d Spears\u2019 exaggerated glare brought on a few nervous laughs, everyone no doubt picturing an angry Spears suplexing a would-be party goer who didn\u2019t abide by the rules. \u201cFirst thing is- \u201cFrom somewhere behind his lapel, Spears produced a small golden envelope. \u201cProm King and Queen!\u201d \n\nI roll my eyes, laughing as I catch sight of Naser being pulled towards the stage by the tangerine terror. Rosa rests her head on my shoulder, moving her hand to stroke my back as we wait for the foregone conclusion. Another waft of her perfume draws me closer to her.\n\n\u201cAnd now! Your winners, for the one Mil, twenty-twenty class, aaaaaaaaaaaaare: Naaaaaaser and Naaaaooomiiii!\u201d\n\nSpears pulls two crowns from a pocket as the class erupts in celebratory chaos. Despite everything Naomi has attempted to pull this year, I still give them a polite applause; Naser at least deserves it. Naomi is, of course, acting beside herself with joy, donning the tiara with her trademark fake smile. I wouldn\u2019t even have put it past her to fix the voting to ensure her victory.\n\nTaking the microphone, Naomi clears her throat, easing back into her role as the perfect prom queen. \u201cThank you all so much, Volcano High!\u201d Naomi begins, her well-rehearsed speech sounding just as fake as the rest of her attitude. \u201cMy, I don\u2019t really have a speech prepared, but\u2026\u201d \n\nSpears buts in, gently pulling the mic away from a rather shocked Naomi. \u201cThanks, you two, but unfortunately we\u2019ve got to stay on schedule and have one more thing planned for tonight.\u201d Naser pulls a distraught and fuming Naomi off to the side of the stage, his own prom crown dangling from his head crest. Oh, how the tables have turned\u2026 \n\n\u201cI know many of you know these next three, and their first concert was a\u2026mixed affair, but I think they\u2019ve all shone us how important a second chance can be. Let\u2019s give it up fooooooooor: VVURM DRAMA!\u201d \n\nSpears marches off-stage, leading a decidedly subdued applause as the red curtains draw open to reveal the band, wielding their instruments. Fang stands at the front in a brilliant purple dress, a look of nervous trepidation creeping across her face, and Trish looked smaller than ever trying to hide behind her bass. Reed, like usual, didn\u2019t seem to notice much of anything. Murmurs ripple through the students, many of whom have whipped out their phones, no doubt thinking to record another meltdown. Rosa and I cheer encouragingly, however, waving to catch the band\u2019s attention from our spot on the edge of the dance floor. Finally catching a look at us, Fang smiles, her confidence rising as she strides right up to the mic stand.\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Volcano High! We\u2019re VVURM DRAMA, and we\u2019re here\u2026\u201d Fang stums a chord on her guitar, instantly silencing the murmurs of the crowd. \u201cTo blow you away!\u201d\n\n***\n\n\u201c\u00a1Dios m\u00edo! Ayyy, An-on, that was so much fun!\u201d An excited Rosa twirls in front of me as we exit the gymnasium with the rest of the class. VVURM DRAMA had been an absolute hit, performing even better than they did at Dino-Moe\u2019s. I could see why Trish was upset about the set-list: It had been mostly safe pop-rock tunes, with a few sanitized originals thrown in. The band\u2019s practice was on full display, and the crowd still buzzed with energy after such a good performance.\n\n\u201cYeah, for sure! Fang and the gang really knocked it out of the park, huh?\u201d Rosa joined me as we waited by the ticket booth, both of us still tapping out feet in tune to the band\u2019s music. Stella, our ride for the evening, had told us to wait for her here. Her and her date had really torn it up on the dance floor, even reenacting the iconic scene from Dirty Dancing. I still couldn\u2019t believe she got the captain of the football team to take her to prom!\n\n\u201cSi, I could no believe it either. But, Stella is very persuasive when she wants to be.\u201d Me and my damn mumbling. Rosa hung onto my shoulder with one hand, fanning herself with the other. We had both been dancing so hard during VVURM DRAMA\u2019s set we were covered in sweat. I tried not to notice how the beads of perspiration rolled slowly down Rosa\u2019s ample cleavage, making her breasts glisten in the dim light of the evening\u2026\n\n\u201cUhh\u2026 D-did Stella say how long she would be?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo, just that we should wait for her here. I hope she did no forget about\u2026 \u00bf!Ay, Me est\u00e1s tomando el pelo!? Look, An-on!\u201d \n\nRosa\u2019s accusatory finger directed me to the side of the gyn, where a VERY occupied Stella was currently playing tonsil-touch with her prom date. Raptor Jesus, Stella was even grabbing his\u2026!\n\n\u201cOooh, that little\u2026\u201d Rosa half-started towards them, rolling up imaginary sleeves as her eyes shot daggers at her one-time friend.\n\n\u201cChill, Rosa!\u201d I managed to turn Rosa back to me, the angry ankylosaur still glaring over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll just call us a cab, okay?\u201d I waved my phone for emphasis, the number of the cab company already typed in. \u201cWe\u2019ll get home, no worries at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine!\u201d Rosa spat acidly, turning away from Stella with a decided \u2018humpf!\u2019 \u201cBut Stella and I will have words when I see her tomorrow, believe me! The nerve of that girl, trying to\u2026\u201d    \n\nSmiling, I let Rosa vent, knowing better than to interrupt. Even without Stella, my plan would still work. In fact, it may even work out better\/\n\n***\n\n\u201cAn-on, where are we going?\u201d The cab sped onwards, down dark streets and running through stop signs like they were nothing. The familiar cab driver flashed me a toothy grin in the rear-view mirror, looking like he was about to start blabbing away again. I had already alluded to him what I was planning when he dropped me off at Rosa\u2019s house before prom started, and the asshole had nearly blurted it out when we got in the cab! If he spoiled the surprise now, I swear to god\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a little post-prom hangout at the arboretum Rosa. Fang and Reed planned it.\u201d While technically not a lie, I knew Rosa could tell I was stretching the truth a little. \u201cI wanted it to be a surprise, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t tell you, sorry!\u201d Hopefully a little preemptive guilt can throw her off the trail.\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026 It\u2019s okay An-on, but why did you no tell me? Couldn\u2019t we have gotten a ride with Reed?\u201d \n\nShit, come up with something quick! \n\n\u201cYeah, but Reed\u2019s van? Do you want to smell like THAT, coming home late at night?\u201d \n\nRosa nodded her head, conceding that no, she did not in fact want to smell like stale socks and body-odor when coming home after Prom. And whatever else Reed would inevitable be smoking.\n\nHeh, diversion successful.\n\nThe cab arrived quickly at the arboretum, skidding to a halt right at the front gates. I sprang out quickly, offering a hand to help Rosa with her billowing dress as she climbed out. After tossing some cash to the driver and watching him speed off the wrong way down a one-way street, we headed towards the entrance. Technically, the arboretum wasn\u2019t open at night, but with only a short bar to jump over, it was no trouble sneaking in.\n\n\u201cAy, An-on, are you sure this is the place? I mean, I do no hear nobody out here, and it\u2019s so dark\u2026\u201d Rosa wrapped her arms around mine, snuggling closer as we walked the lonely paths. It was pretty dark, the unlit walkways stretching out into the darkness forebodingly. With only our phone lights to guide us, it took me a few moments to find the right path to our destination.\n\n\u201cThey said they\u2019d meet us at the gazebo. See, those lights up ahead?\u201d I shoot Rosa a sly smile, knowing full well she can\u2019t see my smug expression in the dark. I point in the dark towards the crest of the hill, where a halo of light is visible through the gloom. \u201cReed\u2019s even got the music set up, listen!\u201d \n\nRosa cocked her head, just barely visible in the night. Faint music could indeed be heard, echoing through the silent park from the top of the hill where the gazebo sat. It had a decidedly Latin flare, easily picked up by Rosa\u2019s attuned ears. And my ears as well, now. \u201cSi, si, I hear it now. But what is that? I do no think Reed liked that sort of stuff\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cI asked him to play it, special like.\u201d We were half-way to the top of the hill, the gentle rise of the hill bringing us closer and closer to the light. \u201cJust something for us, Rosa. Nearly there now, mi amor.\u201d \n\nRosa redoubled her grip on my arm. The shiver running through her body makes me mistake it for fear at first; but, now that my eyes had adjusted somewhat to the night, I could see that it wasn\u2019t from fear, but from recognition. \n\n\u201cAn-on, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice caught in her throat. We were nearly at the top now, the light from the gazebo strong enough now that we didn\u2019t really need our phones. The music could be heard clearly now, the quiet tune easily recognizable now. \n\n\u2018En el desierto un viajero de amor desesperado queria morir\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cI found an old copy online, and, well, one burned CD later, we were in business.\u201d I took Rosa\u2019s hands as I lead her up the last few feet of the hill, my back to the gazebo. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t think it\u2019s too cheesy, Rosa, but\u2026\u201d\n\nThe gazebo was strung up with fairy lights, a brilliant twinkling ring illuminating the scene below. A white sheet was laid over the park bench, on top of which sat Reed\u2019s old boombox, which I had borrowed for this occasion. Dozens of bouquets of Rosa\u2019s favorite flowers were set up around the bench, stuffed in as many mis-matched vases as Fang and Trish could lend me. Candles lined the gazebo\u2019s railing, each one the best of Stella\u2019s collection, or so she claimed. I had worked hard to make it as romantic as possible, and with my back turned, I could fully take the expression of pleasant disbelief on Rosa\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cEveryone helped me out when they heard what I was planning. Which is good, because there was no way I could\u2019ve gotten this all done myself. I mean, I don\u2019t think I even own a vase!\u201d Rosa said nothing, the beautiful woman I loved just staring at me, her mouth slightly agape. I hoped the tears welling up in Rosa\u2019s eyes were tears of joy. \u201cI know you loved this spot, when we were here the other day, and I guess if I couldn\u2019t give you the wildflowers\u2026\u201d I waved my hand towards the bouquets, each a little cluster of the flowers Rosa had admired so strongly. \u201c\u2026This was the next best thing. Do you like it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, mi amor, I love it!\u201d Rosa said at last, hugging me tight. She wiped away a tear as she pulled away, face beaming, her crimson eyes struggled to take it all in. \u201cIt\u2019s so pretty, and so romantic! I\u2019m shocked, but why, An-on?\u201d Rosa\u2019s eyes flickered from the gazebo to my own, still not fully comprehending. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not grateful, but why?\u201d \n\n\u201cBecause, like I said, you deserve to be the happiest woman in the world tonight.\u201d Taking a step back, I pull the final surprise from its hiding spot behind the boombox: A single Middlemist Red Camelia. \u201cAnd I may not have the money for a proper ring, but\u2026\u201d I slowly knelt on one knee, a sharp gasp escaping Rosa\u2019s mouth before she covered it with her hands. Offering the very flower that had marked out first time meeting each other, I ask Rosa the most important question of my life:\n\n\u201cRosa, will you marry me?\u201d\n\nAnd you know what? She said yes."},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"The Garden of Rosa\n\nChapter 2\n\nIt\u2019s been a few days since my close encounter of the Rosa kind took place at the school garden. I\u2019ve been feeling\u2026 different, ever since, like something inside of me is slowly filling up with\u2026something. Any tension that may have arisen from Fang deciding they want to play guitar instead of bass seems to have evaporated, and the band has been in a frenzy, practicing with renewed vigor. Everything was going well, until\u2026\n\nRosa: Hola, An-on, can we talk after school?\n\nRosa: I really need someone to talk to\u2026\n\nI froze, standing in the middle of the school hallway, several students shouldering their way past me angrily. Since our almost-kiss, Rosa and I have been texting back and forth, most of it pretty basic stuff. I was afraid to ask about her family again, worried that it might upset her. Even I knew that sort of thing should be talked about in person, but a selfish part of me had hoped that by avoiding the issue, everything would just work itself out. \n\nAnon: Sure, where do you wanna meet?\n\nRosa: There\u2019s a restaurant in Old Town that I like to go, wanna meet there?\n\nOld town, huh. That\u2019s the part of town that lies right at the edge, popular with the Hispanic and Latino dinos. By bus it\u2019ll take me a while to make it there, and I\u2019ve got a pretty important assignment from Mr. Carldobiski to finish tonight\u2026\n\nFuck it. If Rosa needs to talk to someone, it\u2019s got to be important.\n\nAnon: I\u2019ll be there :)\n\nRosa: Oh, gracias An-on! I\u2019ll send you the address! \n\nRosa: Looking forward to it :)\n\n***\n\nI end up needing to take two busses to make it to the address Rosa texted, my mind racing as the Volcaldera streets rushed by, unseen. I kept telling myself to relax, that Rosa just needed someone to talk to, probably about her mother. I don\u2019t think she told anyone else about that, even Stella, so it was natural to confide in me, right? I mean, it wasn\u2019t a\u2026 date, or anything? I was just getting some food.\n\nWith a girl.\n\nWho I almost kissed the other week.\n\n\u2026I really wish those alarms would shut up\u2026\n\nThe sun had warmed up considerably as I walked the streets of Old Town, a sudden early-spring heatwave causing me to sweat profusely. I tried to ignore the odd looks passersby kept shooting me: It was pretty rare for a human to be in Old Town alone, let alone one who was as white as I was. Hurrying along, I finally made it to the place Rosa mentioned: An old brick taqueria, a half-dozen or so small plastic tables and chairs set up around the entrance. A poorly-painted depiction of a Dino-ball Z character towers on one side of the building, a muscle-bound Saurian, his golden crest bristling with energy. Pulling my phone out to let Rosa I\u2019m here, I pause to snap a picture of the faded yet surprising well-painted figure: Man, the boys on the Ethiopian knitting smoke-signal system aren\u2019t going to believe this. Evidence logged, I take one final look around for Rosa, before suddenly someone careens into my back, their powerful arms pinning my own to my sides. \n\n\u201cAn-on, there you are! Dios m\u00edo, you took your sweet time, vago!\u201d My fear subsides as I notice that it\u2019s Rosa hugging me from behind. I can tell by the force she\u2019s exerting that she\u2019s happy to see me, and the feeling of her ample bosom pressing against my back is making me VERY happy to see her. Rosa spins me around by the shoulders until I\u2019m facing her, flashing me a beaming smile before hugging me again, resting her head on my chest. \u201cAn-on, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here\u2026\u201d \n\nMy arms wrap awkwardly around her back as I return the hug. \u201cOf course Rosa. So, this place any good?\u201d I ask, flashing Rosa a smile as we break apart. knowing full well that with an anime character on the side, there\u2019s no way this place can be bad. Rosa catches onto my little jibe, elbowing me in the ribs while laughing.\n\n\u201cOh, si, si An-on! It\u2019s the best in all of Old Town! Come on, let\u2019s get in line, this place fills up fast!\u201d Before I can make a move, Rosa grabs my hand before eagerly tugging me inside. I can feel my heartbeat quicken as she takes my hand, hear the alarm bells starting to sound in my head once more. The inside of the taqueria is cramped, with more tables taking up most of the space inside. An menu lists what I assume is the food, the hand-written Spanish completely incomprehensible to me. True to Rosa\u2019s word a line has already started to form, a few customers glancing back at us as we take out spots at the end of the line. \n\n\u201cSo, uh, how\u2019s the\u2026\u201d I try to mouth out the syllables to one of the items, sending Rosa into another fit of laughter. \n\nShe\u2019s still holding my hand.\n\n\u201cOh An-on, don\u2019t worry! I can order for us, is no problem!\u201d Rosa gives me another smile, her crimson eyes twinkling in the florescent lighting. A long moment passes, each of us staring at the other before finally snapping back to reality. Blushing, Rosa drops my hand, quickly crossing her arms beneath her breasts as she attempts to hide her embarrassment. We make small talk for the rest of the wait, about our classes, how the garden is doing. As we share with each other, I realize just how nice hanging out with Rosa is. She\u2019s cute and funny, twirling her hair around one finger as she listens to me talk, equally at ease talking about herself as she is asking about my own life. Somehow, she manages to pull more out of me than I\u2019ve shared with even Fang and the gang, stories of my life and my parents coming out as naturally as any shitpost. The wait in line passes by in a flash, and one hurried order in Spanish later, Rosa and I take a seat outside, settling next to each other in the weather-worn plastic seats. \n\n\u201cSo, Rosa, what did you want to talk about? When you texted, I mean.\u201d I\u2019ve been dreading this question, but the longer I talked about my own family back home in Rock Bottom, the more I knew I had to ask. My suspicions are confirmed as Rosa\u2019s face falls, and I hate myself for how sad she looks now, resisting the urge to throw my arm around her to comfort her.  \n\nRosa heaves a heavy sigh before beginning to speak, fidgeting with her bracelet as she does. \u201cIt\u2019s mi madre, An-on, she is driving me crazy! All she say is \u2018Rosa, when are you gonna finish school so you can help us at work?\u2019 \u2018Rosa, why haven\u2019t you brought any nice boys home yet?\u2019\u201d  My heart does another flutter-jump at that, but I keep silent, letting Rosa vent out her frustrations. Rosa begins gesturing angrily with her hands as she goes on, waggling her finger at her imaginary mother. \u201cBut when I ask her about her pain, offer to help, it\u2019s just \u2018No, no, es demasiado problema!\u2019 I know something is wrong, but she won\u2019t let me in!\u201d Deflating a little, Rosa drops her hands back to the table with a thump, her gaze following them dejectedly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do! The one persona I want to help the most, and she doesn\u2019t let me!\u201d \n\nA lull appears in the conversation, and I know this is my moment to speak up. Hoping my palms aren\u2019t too sweaty, I reach over to take Rosa\u2019s hand, giving her a little squeeze of encouragement. \u201cRosa, I\u2019m sorry you have to go through with that, it sounds harsh. But you can\u2019t force these things, you can\u2019t make people let you in. You have to\u2026let them let you in, you know?\u201d I stumble over my words as Rosa looks up at me, her beautiful eyes shimmering with unshed tears. Her hand squeezes mine back. \u201cI maybe don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going through, and maybe no one\u2019s cared for me like this before, but\u2026 Argh, what I mean is, you\u2019re lucky to have someone who loves you like that. Maybe just by loving them back, that\u2019s enough, you know?\u201d \n\nRosa is silent as she stares up at me, clearly thinking on what I\u2019ve just said. Moments pass, and I know well enough to shut up and be quiet, to let Rosa work out what she\u2019s feeling. Rosa breaks the silence at last, her voice catching slightly. \u201cYou do have people who care about you, An-on.\u201d Suddenly, Rosa pulls her hand out of mine, reaching up to take either side of my face. Her face rises to meet mine as she pulls me down, planting her mouth on mine in a kiss.\n\nWARNING!!\n\nWARNING!!\n\nWE ARE NOW BEING SMOOCHED BY A QT-LATINA DINO!!\n\nI\u2019m so taken aback, it\u2019s all I can do for a second to just let Rosa kiss me. It\u2019s awkward at first, her beaky snoot making it difficult for her to get her lips on mine properly. But then my surprise fades, and I kiss her back, a slow, soft kiss that seems to go on forever. My eyes close, letting me fall into the kiss entirely, until it\u2019s all I can feel, wanting with all my heart for it to never end. All thought is banished by the kiss, replaced entirely with Rosa. Beautiful, loving, sweet Rosa.\n\nWe finally break apart, our lips clinging together for a split-second before we settle back, eyes opening. It feels like I\u2019ve just run a hundred miles, my heart fit to burst as it thunders in my chest. Rosa still holds my face in her hands, her eyes staring deeply into mine. This close, I can see every facet of those crimson eyes, sparkling like gems in her kind face. A sudden grin splits Rosa\u2019s face, and I find myself sporting one equally as large. Giggling, we start to lean into each other once more, our eyes slowly closing. The second kiss is a sweet as the first, and yet there\u2019s an intensity behind it, as if some unspoken agreement has passed between us and the kiss is the means by which we seal the deal. This time, I take Rosa\u2019s face in my hands as well, making sure to scrub them on my jeans beforehand. Our second kiss lasts longer than the first, neither of us willing to break it off, but eventually Rosa pulls away, resting her forehead on mine. \n\n\u201cOh, eso estuvo bien, Anon\u2026 That was very, very nice\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s whisper is nearly silent against the noise of the street, a quiet prayer uttered for only the two of us to hear. Moving her hands away from my face, she takes both of mine, holding them together between us as she sits back. \u201cI care about you, An-on. You are the est\u00fapido humano that makes me feel like the prettiest ni\u00f1ita in the world. And I like that.\u201d Rosa flashes another of her smiles, the one that fills her whole face with joy. \u201cI like that a lot.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the day passes by in a blur. Food was eventually brought out, Rosa having ordered the both of us a selection of her favorite tacos. She even ordered mine with real meat, sparing me the tofu and soy replacements that she usually ate. Luckily, Rosa picked the perfect spot for our first date, as we could eat the tacos with one hand, holding the other\u2019s hand underneath the table. The Super Saurian on the side didn\u2019t lie, either: They really were the best tacos I had ever had. \n\nAfterwards Rosa offered to drive me home. Apparently, she had forgotten I didn\u2019t have a car, and the thought of me taking the busses home this late worried her to no end. I gave Rosa an address not too far from where I actually lived, still not wanting her to know I lived in the shithole that was Skin Row. Rosa gave my hand another squeeze before I got out of her car, smiling as I placed a chaste kiss on her cheek. \n\n\u201cSee you tomorrow, Rosa.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you tomorrow, mi novio\u201d\n"},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"Garden of Rosa\n\nChapter 3\n\nA few weeks passed since my first date with Rosa. Rosa and I had been spending a lot more time together, and her and Stella seemed to mingle well with the rest of the Fang Gang. It was strange to think that at the beginning of the year, I was bound and determined to coast through under the radar, invisible. Now, not only had I accumulated a handful of friends, I even had a\u2026 girlfriend. A beautiful Latina Dino Gee-Eff. I was even shitposting less as of late, my hands automatically texting Rosa whenever I whipped out my phone to visit my favorite Mongolian throat-singing IRC. \n\nGood job Anon, you\u2019ve ruined your chances at wizardry.\n\nStill, it wasn\u2019t all good. It seemed Rosa was a little embarrassed about our first kiss, the word having gotten around to her family that she was making out with some skinny out in Old Town. Since then, the most I\u2019d gotten to do with her is hold hands as I walked her to class. For us being in a dino-human relationship, most people in the school seemed to be alright with it, actually. Reed had shot me his patent-pending double finger-guns when he first noticed us, accompanied by a very serious \u201cBroooo!\u201d. Even the purple menace, Trish, seemed pleased; at least, I choose to assume her shoulder-punch that day was in congratulations, no matter how hard it hurt. The only one who seemed less than enthused was Fang. She seemed\u2026sad, when she saw Rosa and I walking together to lunch, her face falling as her hands had twitched towards her wing. She hid it well, though, teasing me later that day about how there was no way I could survive Rosa\u2019s cooking. But I caught her looking at me when she thought I couldn\u2019t see, that same sad expression on her face.\n\n\u2026\n\nDid Fang\u2026\n\nNo way, we\u2019re just friends, right?\n\n\u2026Yeah, just friends.\n\nSo why do I feel so awkward when I\u2019m around her? The other day, Fang asked for help in finding a venue for the band to play, Trish and Reed apparently finding other things more important than getting a good location to play at. I tagged along with Fang as she trekked all across the city, escorted by Naser and Naomi. Naomi kept asking about Rosa, how we were doing, saying how glad she was at our \u201cblossoming relationship\u201d. The whole thing set Fang off, and by the time we found a place to play \u2013 Dino-Moe\u2019s, her uncle\u2019s pizza shop \u2013 I thought Fang was going to choke Naomi out with her own tongue. Fang barely said goodbye to me when I left her house that night, mumbling her thanks as she trudged up to her room, leaving me standing in the doorway with the Chiffon Commandant. \n\n\u201cSi, I worry about Fang, An-on. We should do something nice for them!\u201d Rosa added the next day at lunch. I was hanging out with her and Stella today, Fang and the gang needing all the time they could get to practice for their concert. Rosa and I were holding hands again under the table, a habit we\u2019d developed since our first date.  \u201cThey work so hard on their banda, it must be difficult, when no one\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice trailed off, the three of us suddenly very introspective about the state of our food. It was true that Fang\u2019s first concert hadn\u2019t gone over very well, and we all dreaded the same thing was going to happen this next time. \n\n\u201cYou said they were doing better now, right Anon? Fang\u2019s playing the guitar now, that\u2019s got to be better!\u201d Stella\u2019s voice was her usual upbeat cheeriness, but I could tell she too was worried. \n\n\u201cYeah, a lot better than that double-bass get-up they were using.\u201d I mentally cringe, recalling the time Reed whipped out his phone to show us a recording of VVURM DRAMA\u2019s early days. Ouch. The thought of a performance like that doesn\u2019t sound like the best way to spend a Saturday, but the thought of getting to go to the concert with Rosa\u2026 Even though we\u2019ve been going out for a while now, most of that time was spent together at school or talking walks at a park or getting a bite to eat. Going to the concert together would be a big step in our relationship. \u201cFang\u2019s really excited about this concert, though. They really want to shove it in the faces of people who didn\u2019t believe in them before.\u201d I\u2019m stalling for time, hoping I can muster up the courage to ask Rosa out without a serious pasta spill. \n\n\u201cI did a tarot reading the other day for them, and it came out really well! I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all go smoothly.\u201d Stella\u2019s face was full of self-satisfaction as she took another sip of whatever Japanese soda she had imported, as if her tarot reading had all but confirmed the concert would go off without a hitch. \n\n\u201cStill, I wish there was something else we could do. I preocupa about Fang, Stella, and no amount of your Diablo-worship will stop that!\u201d Rosa wagged her finger at Stella, a gesture she did often whenever Stella\u2019s tarot readings came up. I learned quickly I wasn\u2019t the only guy in a relationship with Rosa: Raptor Jesus had got there first, and I was gonna have to share. \n\nStella opened her mouth, no doubt a retort prepared for her old friend. If I didn\u2019t ask Rosa now, I would have to sit through another argument about the importance of one\u2019s immortal soul, and how Raptor Jesus had sacrificed himself for all of us, dino or human. \n\nThe moment of truth was at hand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to be there, to support the band, to support Fang.\u201d I can already feel my face blushing. Taking a deep breath, I tried to keep my voice calm. \u201cS-speaking of, Rosa, did you want to\u2026 you know, uh, come to the concert with me?\u201d I glance shyly at Rosa, hoping my palm isn\u2019t too sweaty against her hand underneath the table. Rosa flashes me a big smile, her cheeks reddening slightly as she gives my hand a squeeze.\n\n\u201cAww, mi novio! Of course I will go to the concert with you, tonto. I am just glad you asked me before I asked you!\u201d Rosa moved her other hand to caress my cheek, something she always did when I did something she found particularly sweet. I smiled back at her, her crimson eyes locking in with mine.\n\n\u201cOh. My. GOD! You guys are so cuuuuuuute!\u201d \n\nOne of these days Stella, one of these days\u2026\n\nA ear-splitting squee from Stella interrupted our moment, causing Rosa to withdraw her hand from my face quickly. \u201cWhatareyougoingtowearRosa? I\u2019ve got this SUPER cute outfit you can borrow if you want. I was gonna wear it, but then I\u2026\u201d I turn my attention back to my food, chuckling as Rosa turned her attention to her best friend. I knew better than to get between my girlfriend and her best friend, especially when they were chatting about clothes. \n\nMy girlfriend, huh.\n\n\u2026feels nice to say.\n\n***\n\nThe night of the concert approached quickly. I arrived early to help the gang set up, Rosa agreeing to meet me there with Stella closer to showtime. Mercifully, Fang seemed to be more like her old self around me, laughing and joking around as I helped Reed run the sound check and set up the stage. I could tell she was nervous, they all were; this was going to be the first time playing in front of others since the disaster my first day. Offering what encouragement and support I could, I left them in the back room of Dino-Moe\u2019s, a text from Rosa saying her and Stella were there.\n\nStepping back into the restaurant proper, I was surprised at the crowd that showed up. The place was packed, filling the none-too-small space Moe had set aside for us. Scanning the room, I finally caught a glimpse of a twin pair of green space-buns near the back of the crowd. Shouldering through the crowd towards Stella, I am ill-prepared for what awaits me.\n\n\u201cAnonnnnnn, this place looks great!\u201d Stella flashes me a big smile when she sees me. Apparently her outfit plans had fallen through, and her simple white t-shirt displaying a familiar slogan was accompanied by her regular shorts. Trying not to think how well \u201coppai\u201d described Stella, I turned my attention towards what was currently taking my breath away: Rosa. Her floral print dress was swapped out for a tight red spaghetti-strap crop-top and tight jeans, the plunging neckline exposing Rosa\u2019s expansive cleavage, the waist-high jeans clinging to her every curve. Rosa\u2019s usual sandals were gone, replaced by a pair of high-heeled pumps that caused her already ample ass to stick out seductively. A smokey grey eye-shadow graced her eyes, and her lashes had been curled to perfection. She was wearing lip-stick, a sinful red color on the end of her snoot. Even her hair was different, shimmering in the light of the restaurant like stars in the night sky. Raptor Jesus help me, she was gorgeous! \n\n\u201cD-do you, uh, like it, An-on? Stella said it made me look muy hermosa\u2026\u201d Rosa was fidgeting with her crop-top, alternating between pulling the low neckline up to hide her large bosom, and pulling the bottom down to cover more of her stomach. \u201cI told her it was too short, too exposici\u00f3n, but she didn\u2019t listen!\u201d Her little black clutch swings widely as Rosa gestures with her hands, a sure sign of her emotions.\n\n\u201cActually, what I said was it made you look super hot, Rosa! It\u2019s from an anime Anon, I can give you the title later.\u201d Stella gave me a wink and a nudge before heading out into the crowd, an enormous shark-like dinosaur who I vaguely remember being on the football team scooping her up in his arms and twirling her about. \n\nStella, you are forgiven.\n\n\u201cRosa, you look\u2026wow. I-I mean, you look really, really nice. Not just nice! Better, uh\u2026 you look really hot. Not hot, beautiful! Not that you\u2019re not hot too, uh, it\u2019s just, you know, you look\u2026\u201d Unable to find the right mix of praising Rosa\u2019s look without sounding too much like the horny teenager I am, I continue to stammer. Seems I didn\u2019t avoid that spaghetti spill after all. Rosa stands there, blushing beneath my admiration as my eyes track up and down her body repeatedly. \n\nMercifully, a cheer from the crowd ends my suffering. Glancing over, I see that VVURM DRAMA has taken the stage at last, Fang and Trish shouldering their instruments as Reed takes his position behind the drums. Immediately they launch into their first song of the set, eliciting another roar of approval from the crowd. A rough mosh-pit has already opened up in front of the stage, the crowd jumping and dancing in time with the music. Turning back to Rosa, I manage to take her by the hand, leaning over to shout in her ear above the noise.\n\n\u201cDo you wanna dance?\u201d An eager nod from Rosa is all I need to lead her out into the crowd. Before long, the two of us are jumping up and down like the rest of them, throwing our hands in the air like we, indeed, just do not care. A glance over to Rosa reveals she\u2019s having fun, laughing and cheering the band along in rapid Spanish. The jumping of the mosh pit sends her breasts heaving up and down, threatening to bounce out of the small top at any moment, but Rosa doesn\u2019t seem to care, too caught up in the music to notice. I can\u2019t peel my eyes away, however, making a mental note to ask Stella for the name of that anime. As I finally pull my eyes away from what is the biggest chest I\u2019ve ever seen, I notice Rosa\u2019s been staring at me this whole time! Blushing, I try to say something, anything, over the music, but Rosa just smiles at me, a mixture of embarrassment and self-satisfaction spreading on her face. Did she want me to check her out?!\n\nThe set goes on for roughly an hour, the crowd singing along to Reed\u2019s incomprehensible lyrics as best they can. Some of the crowd had gotten a little rowdy by the end, and I managed to watch out of the corner of my eye Stella going down at the front of the mosh pit, her chad-shark companion too busy head-banging to care. By the finale, the band is soaked in sweat, and Fang\u2019s one last mad strumming is met with thunderous applause and cheers from the assembled crowd. I applaud just as hard, and Rosa\u2019s shouts of \u201c\u00a1bis!\u201d join in with the rest of the crowd\u2019s cheers. As the band begins to walk off-stage the crowd disperses, leaving Rosa and I standing there, beaming at each other. Rosa is covered in sweat, her body glistening in the light of the restaurant, and I struggle to keep my eyes on her face. Taking both my hands in hers, Rosa gives a few excited hops up and down, giggling to herself. I\u2019ve got to grit my teeth this time to not look down.\n\n\u201cAn-on, they were maravillosa! Fang seemed so happy on stage! Ahh, me divert\u00ed mucho!\u201d Rosa pulls me into a hug, pressing her sweaty body against mine. Hoping she can\u2019t feel how happy I am to see her, I hug her back, my hands inadvertently stroking her hair as I do so. Rosa settles her chin on my shoulder, pressing her sweat-damp cheek into my own as I lean my head down. This close to her, I can smell her scent, a heady aroma of sweat mixed in with her familiar floral smell. There\u2019s something else as well, some sort of perfume that wasn\u2019t there before, and before I can stop myself I inhale more of her, smiling. Rosa\u2019s body feels nice pressed against mine, and I hug her tighter, feeling the not insignificant weight of her breasts against my chest. By now I\u2019ve learned to ignore the alarms in my head, instead filling it wholly with the sensation of Rosa.\n\nAfter a moment our embrace ends, and my hands find themselves resting on her waist. \u201cYeah, they were great, the whole band\u2026\u201d Glancing up at me, Rosa wraps her arms neck, our faces dangerously close to one another. All I can do is stare at her, my mind filled with her smell, her face, her body. Filled with how beautiful and sexy she is, how happy she looks right now, her smile splitting her face. \n\nDamn, but I wanna protect that smile. \n\nSlowly, we lean into each other, our lips parting. Something catches Rosa\u2019s smokey red eyes, causing her to glance towards the stage even as mine close entirely. Suddenly, Rosa pulls away from me, leaving me to make duck-lips at no one as she turns her head.\n\n\u201cStella!\u201d Rosa rushes over to her friend at once. Apparently things had gotten a little too rowdy in that mosh pit, and by the look of Stella she had suffered the worst of it. \u201cRo I am so sorry Stella! Come, I shall nurse you back at my home! Anon, help me carry her to the car!\u201d Pulling Stella\u2019s arm over her shoulder, I\u2019m reminded just how strong Rosa is as she drags the dazed woman to her feet. Hurrying over to help, I take Stella\u2019s other arm, and between the two of us we manage to drag Stella through the thinning crowd to where Rosa\u2019s car is parked outside. Muttering to herself about how she should have never let Stella out of her sight, Rosa manages to drop Stella into the back seat, buckling her in before turning back to me, mopping her brow. \n\n\u201cIs Stella going to be alright?\u201d The cool night air feels nice, a welcome relief after the heat of the dance floor, but I still feel flushed every time Rosa glances towards me. \n\n\u201cSi, si, she should be fine. Ohhh, those bastardos! If I find out who did this\u2026\u201d Rosa mutters to herself in Spanish as she fiddles with her clutch, finding her keys at last. Her face is vivid, nearly as angry as when I had fallen into her flowers.\n\n\u201cDo\u2026do you want me to help, at all? I can go with you to\u2026\u201d My voice trails off, my hands flopping to my sides. This wasn\u2019t how I imagined this night to end, with Rosa leaving to go nurse a concussed Stella back to life. I suspect it wasn\u2019t how Rosa wanted things to end either, with how close we were at the end of the band\u2019s performance. Rosa looks up at me once more, the anger vanishing from her face at once. Pouting her lips, Rosa puts her hand to my cheek once more.\n\n\u201cAww, mi novio! It\u2019s okay, I can manage. Oh lo siento mucho, An-on, I have to run off on our little date night.\u201d Rosa slowly strokes the side of my face, a tender touch of her fingertips. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you, okay?\u201d \n\nI smile, taking Rosa\u2019s hand in mine and giving it a little squeeze. A sudden moment of realization makes me understand what those squeezes were, for us: A tender expression of our mutual attraction for one another. In the absence of kissing, it was what Rosa and I had adopted to say just how much the other one meant to us. Rosa squeezes back, her crimson eye staring up at mine.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay Rosa, I\u2019ll text you later toni \u2013 mmph!\u201d\n\nMy voice is cut off as Rosa leans up to kiss me. Unlike our tender kisses we shared weeks before, this one is hard, almost savage, Rosa biting my lip slightly as her tongue enters my mouth, teasing my own before caressing across the inside of my lips, both bottom and top. There\u2019s a hunger in Rosa\u2019s kiss, a sense of wanting something more, like a starving man settling into their first meal. Eventually, Rosa settles back down, slowly breaking apart as a soft sigh escapes our lips. A trail of saliva links us together momentarily before Rosa licks her lips, as if to savor the taste of me.\n\n\u201cI PROMISE I\u2019ll make it up to you, mi novio. Goodnight, An-on. Text me, si?\u201d Rosa flashes a mischievous grin as she walks to the other side of the car, raising her eyebrows as she gets in. Bidding me goodbye with a honk and a wave, Rosa drives off, leaving me standing dazed and confused on the curb. I raise one hand to my lips, wiping off a remnant of lip-stick that had transferred to me. Smiling, I start making my way home, not caring about how far the walk to Skin row was, or how late it was. \n\nShe promised, huh?\n"},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"The Garden of Rosa\n\nChapter 4\n\nA few weeks pass by since the concert back in February. Things have cooled off with VVRUM DRAMA and the Fang Gang; Trish hasn\u2019t been able to book any new gigs, so the three of them are doubling-down on practicing. Trish still isn\u2019t happy about the size of the crowd the concert at Dino-Moe\u2019s drew in, so she\u2019s had Reed and I go around town putting up flyers advertising for the band. It\u2019s nice, getting some bro-time away from the purple prima-donna, but it means I get to spend less time with Rosa. If I didn\u2019t know better, I would think Trish would want it that way.\n\n\u201cNah, bro, Trish just wants to increase the band\u2019s exposure!\u201d Mumbling again. Reed finishes stapling a VVRUM DRAMA poster to the side of a telephone, on the corner of the main downtown block. The poster is a mish-mash of shapes, the band\u2019s name barely legible against the green and purple background. The band\u2019s musical talent may have improved, but there\u2019s still work to be done on their image. \n\n\u201cReed, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accident Trish asked me and you to do this. You can\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t see her smirk when she handed me this?\u201d I gesture with the massive stack of posters clutched in my hand. We\u2019ve been out here all afternoon, and we still have over half of them to put up. \u201cShe just wants to make me miserable is all. She\u2019s jealous the \u201cSkinnie\u201d has a girlfriend, and she\u2019s got nothing!\u201d \n\nReed turns to me, his eyes suddenly serious. The impact of his gaze is lessened somewhat by the fact that the poster he just put up is upside-down, but I can sense he\u2019s about to tell me something serious. \u201cAnon, why do you think she isn\u2019t seeing anyone? And don\u2019t say it\u2019s because she\u2019s a bitch.\u201d I bite down on the half-formed words, the loose weight of the posters making it hard to keep up with the pink raptor as she hurries to the next poster spot. \u201cIt\u2019s because she cares about the band, bro. And her friends. You\u2019ve been hanging out with Rosa a lot now, so you can\u2019t see how Fang and Trish are like. They\u2019re like this!\u201d Reed crosses the first two fingers of his free hand, holding out his other for another poster. \u201cTrish\u2019ll die before something gets between her and her friends\u2019 happiness, bro, and that includes the band. So come on, help me get these up and you can hang out with your girlfriend.\u201d \n\nReed flashes me his biggest shit-eating grin. He\u2019s given me no end of good-natured ribbing about Rosa and mine\u2019s relationship since I told him about what happened to the concert, and I definitely don\u2019t need another lecture about sexual yoga from Reed right now.\n\nAlthough I learned way more from him than I did from my usual Azerbaijiani car-Importing billboard.\n\nSighing, I concede to Reed\u2019s point. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right man. I should be a better friend to Trish. It\u2019s not like I even helped clean up after the concert last time. Taking off like that was pretty lame, huh?\u201d I hand Reed another poster, hiding a smile. Whatever Reed was on right now must be strong stuff; he hadn\u2019t noticed this was the third poster he was taping onto the side of the lamppost.\n\n\u201cNo worries man. Say, you wanna get a bite to eat? I\u2019m STARVIN\u2019, bro.\u201d \n\nUgh. I shoot Rosa a text asking how she\u2019s doing as Reed draws us along to our third food stop of the afternoon. Her and Stella were going to hang out this afternoon, a little girl time for the both of them. Rosa\u2019s mom still wasn\u2019t doing very well, and as far as I could tell Stella was the only other one who knew about it. \n\nAnon: You and Stella having fun?\n\nAnon: Gonna be here forever putting these posters up, Reed is on something today and he\u2019s eating everything in sight.\n\nWaiting for Reed to finish his order at a hot-dog cart now, I replace the phone in my pocket just in time to share a look with the vendor, her comically oversized chef\u2019s hat flopping from side to side as she rolls her eyes at me. From the number of dogs she\u2019s got lined up, Reed is planning on eating her out of business. I wonder if I could get Reed to eat these posters if I put mustard on them\u2026\n\nA buzzing in my pocket cuts my thoughts short, and I replace the bottle of mustard I had been hovering over the stack of posters. Rosa\u2019s reply immediately improves my mood.\n\nRosa: Si, Si, we are having fun! \n\nRosa\u2019s text included a picture of the two of them, a selfie in what appeared to be a second-hand bookstore. It looked like Stella had a collection of manga in her hands, too distracted by the camera to notice Rosa\u2019s judgmental glance towards her choice in literature. If I knew Rosa, she probably found a new edition of Good Cavepainting, no doubt another unsuccessful attempt to teach Stella about the virtues of Raptor Jesus. As Reed collects the foil-wrapped hot-dogs in his arms, another text from Rosa vibrates the phone in my hands.\n\nRosa: I have not forgotten my promise, mi novio. Would you like to come meet mi madre tomorrow? She is making ~mole poblano~\n\nDamn. Rosa knows I can\u2019t resist her mother\u2019s home cooking, and I would really like to meet the woman. But am I ready to meet my girlfriend\u2019s parents? A tinge of nerves flutters through my stomach as I thumb my response, watching disgustedly as Reed manages to swallow a hot-dog whole. Rosa has a typically large family: Five brothers, all older than her, plus her mom and dad. Seems her dad owns a farm somewhere on the edge of town, a family business that everyone pitched in for. Rosa\u2019s brothers all worked there full-time, although beyond that, I knew little about them. I wonder if that\u2019s where Rosa got her religious side from?\n\nAnon: Sure, sounds nice :) \n\nRosa: Oooh, An-on, gracias! Mama is very excited to mee you :)\n\nAnon: Is you whole family gonna be there too?  \n\nRosa: No, just mi madre. Papi and mi hermanos will be out on a delivery tomorrow. \n\nJust her mom, then. I know I should feel nervous, meeting Rosa\u2019s mother, but I feel\u2026 calm, almost resolute. Like this is something that I not only need to do, but something that I actually want to do. I hardly notice as Reed gets up to go, tossing an immense ball of wadded-up hot-dog wrappers in a nearby trashcan; my mind is focused on what tomorrow might bring, and how I can impress Rosa\u2019s mom.\n\nRosa: Btw, An-on, do you have a crucifix to wear?\n\nShit. Already off to a bad start.\n\n***\n\nThe next day at school passes by in a blur. An announcement by Principal Spears finishes the day; a reminder about the upcoming midterms. Sitting in the back of the auditorium with the Fang Gang, we collectively groan, dreading the upcoming cram sessions required to barely scrape us by. As the assembled student body begins to filter out of the auditorium, Reed and Trish are already talking about getting an all-night math study session on the books. With Reed\u2019s help I\u2019ve been able to maintain a passing grade in Mr. Careldoweskii\u2019s class, but the idea of spending one of my precious evenings subjecting myself to Trish\u2019s not-so-passive-aggressive comments is not one I want to subject myself to. \n\nChecking my phone, I\u2019ve got a few minutes before Rosa and I were to meet up in the parking lot. No harm in getting there early, I suppose. Saying my goodbyes to the gang, I turn to leave, but not before something darts out to catch my sleeve. Fang\u2019s hand. As I turn back, her grip falters, leaving her hand to brush against mine for a moment before she holds it against her other arm.  \n\n\u201cUm, Anon, I-I was thinking\u2026 Maybe you and I could, like, study at my place?\u201d Her face is downcast, her head tilted. Fang stares at me sideways, her amber eyes pleading as an errant strand of her hair falls down her face. She looks uncertain, nervous even, her wings held rigidly out to either side in anticipation.\n\nOh boy. \n\nReed\u2019s comments about Trish doing anything for her friend\u2019s happiness echo through my mind. But I already made plans with Rosa\u2026 I need a second to work some moisture into my suddenly dry mouth. \u201cUmm, sorry Fang, I kinda already made plans with Rosa tonight.\u201d Fang sags at my words, like a sack suddenly emptied. Her wings fall slack behind her, one hand twitching absently towards them. She recovers quickly though, flashing me a smile while jabbing me in the shoulder. Behind her, I can see Trish looking our way, her eyes narrowed, a thin smile spreading on her lips.\n\n\u201cWhatever, dweeb. Just promise you\u2019ll try convincing her to let you use a rubber, okay?\u201d Before I can respond she\u2019s gone, turning back to Trish like a closed door. I linger on the edge of the group for a moment, listening to the three of them planning a study session or something, before turning towards the parking lot. I can hear Reed\u2019s uproarious laughter as I cross the front of the school, memories of my first day at Volcano High flashing through my mind. \n\nRosa is already waiting for me at her car, a sky-blue Toyoreta Prius sporting a prominent \u201cWWRJD?\u201d bumper sticker. Catching sight of me, Rosa gives me a wave, a happy smile on her face. I force myself to wave back, trying to forget Fang\u2019s face when I gave her the news. As we meet up at the car, Rosa pulls me into a big hug, her keys ready in her hand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s mi novio! Ready to meet my madre? Awww, An-on, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Concern fills Rosa\u2019s face as our hug ends, her crimson eyes searching my face closely. \u201cAre you not excited to meet her?\u201d\n\nFfffuck, so much for hiding things.\n\nI flash what I hope is a realistic smile, reaching up to give Rosa\u2019s hand a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Rosa, I\u2019m okay. Really! I\u2019m still excited, see?\u201d I hold up Rosa\u2019s gift on its chain around my neck: A small metal crucifix. She slipped it into my locker earlier today, along with a note: \u2018Remember my promise, mi novio.\u2019\n\nStill uncertain, Rosa climbs into her car as I do the same, studying me briefly before turning the keys in the ignition. \u201cMi familia means a lot to me, An-on, and I just want them to like you. If you don\u2019t want to wear el crucifijo, that\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d A look of absolute dejection crawls into Rosa\u2019s face, and she sits there, eyes down, fiddling with the gearstick. My heart nearly tears into two as I watch her. Putting my hand on hers, I let our fingers entwine on the hard plastic for a moment before pulling her hand to my lips, planting a soft kiss on the back of her hand. \n\n\u201cI am excited Rosa. And a little scared; scared that I\u2019ll say something or do something dumb in front of your mom. It means a lot to me, that you want me to meet her. I know how much she means to you, Rosa, and I want her to mean that much to me, in time. Rosa\u2019s face beams red with embarrassed happiness at my cheesy lines, but at least there\u2019s no sadness in those beautiful eyes anymore. I pull her hand onto my chest, above where the crucifix sits beneath my clothes. \u201cBesides, at least I\u2019ll finally have some protection against those Vampiresaurus roaming around town.\u201d\n\nRosa snorts, laughing despite herself at my lame joke, letting her hand rest a little longer on my chest before popping her car into gear and pulling out of the parking lot. \u201c\u00a1Ayy, mi novio es tan tonto! What am I going to do with you, An-on?\u201d I hold up the small metal cross to ward against imaginary vampiresaurs, causing Rosa to laugh again; a rich, melodic boom, filling the car with her happiness. I know Rosa is embarrassed about her loud laugh, often choosing to hide it in a quieter giggle when we were around friends. For the rest of the trip, I do everything I can to make her laugh, even singing along to the Spanish songs on the radio. For her to let her guard down with me, to share this private, joyful moment in the car alone together\u2026 \n\nMoments like this are what I want more of.\n"},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 5.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 5.txt"],"text":"The Garden of Rosa \n\nChapter 5\n\nI entertain the both of us during the long car trip to Rosa\u2019s house on the outskirts of Volcaldera, the city slowly giving way to suburban neighborhoods, which in turn yield their place to a patchwork of farms and ranch houses. Rosa turns off the lonely two-lane road, passing through a wrought-iron gate and down a well-maintained gravel drive. The gate proclaimed this as Rosa\u2019s Family\u2019s farm, and long stretches of green growing\u2026things stretch off on either side of the drive. Even after all this time spent with the Garden club, I still have no idea how to tell plants: No doubt Rosa could tell me each and every crop her family grows. \n\n\u201cSi, An-on, I know everything we grow out here! Papi likes when I take an interest in the family business.\u201d Rosa must\u2019ve heard my muttering, giving a smile as we pull up to a large ranch-style home, the open-air garage next to the house already filled with work trucks and a family mini-van. The garage is filled with fertilizer, farm tools, hoses: Everything to keep a family farm up and running. Following Rosa out of the car, my eyes linger on the back of one of the trucks, where several empty racks line the raised wooden walls of the truck bed.\n\nRosa follows my gaze as she grabs her bag out of the backseat of her car. \u201cThat\u2019s Papi\u2019s truck. Mama doesn\u2019t let him have his guns just lying in the back anymore, so he has to put them in the house.\u201d What little blood I have left in my monitor-bleached face fades at Rosa\u2019s words, eliciting another joyous laugh. \u201cAy, don\u2019t look so worried, An-on! I\u2019m sure he will like you as soon as he sees what a nice novio you are!\u201d Rosa gives me a playful hip-check, her ample backside causing me to stumble a few paces sideways. \n\n\u201cYou sure he\u2019s forgotten what his friend told him about us at the taqueria?\u201d I meant it as a playful jab back at her, but Rosa\u2019s face is suddenly serious, all humor gone as she turns towards me on the walk up to the house.\n\n\u201cNo, An-on. Papi doesn\u2019t forget what happens to his little girl.\u201d Rosa leaves me there, my face no doubt as white as sheet as she walks backwards, keeping her eyes on me. She covers her mouth with her hands, a gesture I initially mistake as serious before I realize she\u2019s hiding back laughter. \u201cAn-on, you make it too easy to tease you!\u201d I dart after Rosa, sending her wooping up the front steps, our laughter echoing across the empty fields. Catching up to her at the front door, I grab Rosa by the waist, tickling her fiercely across her stomach. Rosa\u2019s laughter raises an octave, her playful shrieks punctuated with cries of \u201c\u00a1misericordia!\u201d as she fumbles with her house keys. \n\nEventually, I cease my hostilities, moving my arms just below her breasts, hugging her tightly. Rosa turns her head back to me with a kind smile, still slightly out of breath.  Those eyes of hers make me melt, sending my heart racing as a blush no doubt spreads across my face. I could get lost in those crimson eyes, so full of warmth and life and love\u2026\n\nGod, I never understood that comic until now.\nI release Rosa until we\u2019re just holding hands, the front door still shut. Neither of us say anything, instead just standing there face-to-face, staring deeply into the other\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s all I can do to not kiss her, here on her family\u2019s front porch. Perhaps the first good idea I\u2019ve had in a while, considering her mother was waiting for us inside, but I still have to force myself to resist the temptation. Rosa\u2019s keys jangle idly in her free hand.\n\n\u201cAn-on, I-\u201c\n\nI cut Rosa off with a smile, Rosa\u2019s face reddening slightly as I place a single finger to her lips.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go meet your madre, Rosa.\u201d\n\nBeaming, Rosa nods, squeezing my hand once more before letting go to open the door. The inside of Rosa\u2019s house can only be described as homey: Pictures of family members line nearly every available inch of the red-painted walls, including some of a young Rosa at what must be her quinceanera. A shoe rack nearly the size of my entire apartment dominates one side of the front door, Rosa slipping her sandals in with the mass of workbooks and sneakers. Rosa dumps her backpack on a bench opposite the door before heading further inside, leading me down a long hallway that must run the length of the house.\n\n\u201cMama! I\u2019m home! An-on is with me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the kitchen, sweetie! Bring him over so I can get a good at him!\u201d A gently matronly voice rings out from further down the hall. Give Rosa a few years, and I reckon she would sound just like her mother. Rosa leads me down into the kitchen in question, a massive citadel devoted to food and the preparation thereof. The kitchen definitely IS bigger than my entire apartment, a huge island dominating the middle of the space as top-of-the-line appliances line the outskirts. The smells wafting from a huge stained cookpot on the stove herald the promise of the delicious mole poblano, causing my mouth to water. But all that is dwarfed by the woman seated on a chain at the middle island, casually sipping from a hand-painted mug featuring two tiny handprints. \n\nRosa greets her mother with a warm hug, planting a kiss on her cheek. Rosa\u2019s mom is the spitting image of her daughter: The same long auburn hair cascades down her back, pulled loosely back in a ponytail this time; the familiar horns of an ankylosaur rising perhaps slightly longer than Rosa\u2019s out of her scalp; the same kind face full of love peering out between the curls. They were built the same as well, Rosa\u2019s mom maybe having the edge on her daughter in the weight department, no doubt a symptom of giving birth to six children. There is a strength in her eyes, however, making the fuzzy blue bathrobe, t-shirt and mom jeans as imposing and sharp as any high-powered suit. The more I look, though, the more cracks I could see in that mom fa\u00e7ade. Rosa was never specific about the nature of her mom\u2019s illness, but evidence of it is readily apparently: Her cheeks are gaunt, her pale peach skin already looking a little sallow. The chair Rosa\u2019s mom sits in would be more at home around a formal dining table than a kitchen, and I think I can see the mug shake slightly as she sets it down.\n\n\u201cSo, you must be Anon\u2026.\u201d Rosa\u2019s mother looks me up and down, her crimson eyes having lost none of their keenness. I feel like I\u2019m being weighed and measured as I extend my hand awkwardly towards the seated matriarch. Rosa\u2019s mom brushes me off with a smile and a shake of her head, holding her arms out towards me. \u201cOooh, come here boy, give me a hug! I\u2019m so glad to finally meet you; Rosa\u2019s done nothing but talk about you ever since you two kissed.\u201d\n\n\u201cMama! \u00a1Eso fue privado!\u201d Rosa has already moved towards the stove, filling the kitchen with more heavenly scent as she stirred the large pot on the stove. Her mom gives me a familial rub on the back before releasing me, picking her mug back up. From here I can see it\u2019s full of coffee, the two small handprints bearing a description: Rosa, 18 months.\n\n\u201cAy, privada my behind, Rosa! You don\u2019t think I would take every opportunity to embarrass you in front of your boyfriend?\u201d Rosa\u2019s mom flashes me a smile above the rim of her mug as Rosa glowers red-faced at her. \u201cBesides, wasn\u2019t it you who I talked to long after your bedtime, all about how to attract a boy she liked?\u201d I can feel my own face begin to glow as I stand there, awkwardly leaning against the kitchen island. \n\n\u201cMama, please! You\u2019re embarrassing me!\u201d Rosa moves about the kitchen as she talks, pulling things out of cabinets and adding them to the pot. Clearly, Rosa is as comfortable in the kitchen as she is in the garden. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what madres are for, sweetie. So, Anon, what about you? Do you like my daughter, my precious little Rosa?\u201d The forwardness of her question catches me off-guard, and I simply stare at Rosa\u2019s mom for a few seconds, dumbfounded. \u201cWell, Anon? She needs a strong man to stand by her, to support her! You can\u2019t stay silent all the time, speak up!\u201d Her demanding tone and piercing gaze reminded me why people found meeting the girlfriend\u2019s parents intimidating. \n\nI finally manage to work some semblance of words out of my mouth. \u201cY-yes, I do, Ma\u2019am. Like Rosa, that is. She\u2019s, uh, very very nice, and, uh\u2026\u201d I trail off, my bravado failing under the patented mom-glare. Rosa\u2019s mom takes another sip of her coffee, one eyebrow cocking in my direction. \n\n\u201cMama, leave An-on alone! Isn\u2019t Papi supposed to be the one who interrogates him?\u201d Rosa turns from the stove towards the two of us, pouting with concern. I shoot her a silent \u2018thank you\u2019, causing Rosa and her mom to smile; Rosa\u2019s knowing, her mother\u2019s mischievous. \n\n\u201cI just have to make sure he\u2019s the right boy for you, Rosa. Not everyone can keep up with your strength. But you do seem like a nice boy, Anon; sorry for the \u2018enfadada madre\u2019 act. Here, let me get you some water, dear.\u201d Rosa\u2019s mom goes to stand, a slow, laborious task that seems to take all her effort, pushing herself up with the island. Rosa is at her side at once, shooing her back into the seat.\n\n\u201cNo, no, Mama, I\u2019ll get An-on some water! You just sit down, you know you need to save your strength! Did you put the chair by the stove when you were stirring like I asked?\u201d \n\nRosa\u2019s mother rolls her eyes as she takes another sip of coffee. \u201cYes, Rosa, I sat by the stove. You know, I am not some fragile doll, I can take care of myself. I raised all of you kids, didn\u2019t I? Anon, do I look weak too you?\u201d \n\nShitshitshitshit.\n\nI can sense the tension in the air at the question. Rosa pauses in filling up a glass from the fridge, glancing my way, her eyes pleading. Rosa\u2019s mom likewise stares at me, and once again I find myself being weighed and measured. This is the woman who was supposed to be eager to see me? My mind whirls between truth and lie: Do I tell the truth, and possibly risk having my girlfriend\u2019s mother mad at me from the first day? Or spare her feelings, and disappoint Rosa? \n\nNo. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to Rosa to lie, just to spare her mom\u2019s feelings. I own Rosa my honestly, in this and everything else, even if it means hurting myself. I can handle her mom not liking me, but I couldn\u2019t bear Rosa being upset.\n\n\u201cUmm, Ma\u2019am, you do seem a little\u2026 tired. Say, is there anything I can do to help? With dinner, I mean. I wouldn\u2019t want to be a burden, or anything. What?\u201d Rosa and her mother stare aghast at me as I offer to help with dinner, as if I just suggested something unthinkable. The moment passes, however, Rosa\u2019s mom smirking as she takes another sip of her coffee. Rosa shoots me a complicated glance of her own as she hands me my water, equal parts thanks and outrage. \n\n\n\u201cNo, Anon, you\u2019re our guest, that means you sit and eat and enjoy yourself. Tired, huh? I guess it\u2019s what my coffee is for, hmmm? Tell me Anon, you just moved her, si?\u201d\n\nI eagerly answer the questions Rosa\u2019s mom fields me, her maternal  interrogation having shifted towards my old school, my family, my hobbies. Luckily, thanks to Rosa I actually have some hobbies now besides shitposting on a Gutemalan hydroponics usenet, and the conversation flows naturally by, the kitchen slowly filling with more and more delicious smells. Rosa chimes in on occasion in my support, confirming that yes, I am indeed been a good boyfriend, and no, I\u2019m not a school-shooter or something. After running me through the gambit, Rosa\u2019s mother gives a self-satisfied nod, I presumably having passed her initial test. As I ask questions of my own about Rosa, her attitude slowly warms, and before long she recounting the adventures of \u2018Rosa de Explora\u2019, laughing along with me as Rosa covers her face in embarrassment.\n\nWiping a tear of laughter from her eye, Rosa\u2019s mom finishes the last of her coffee. \u201cRosa, sweetie, could you go get my purse? It\u2019s on the dining table. I need pictures of the two of you! My little Rosa, all grown up, bringing a boy home with her for the first time.\u201d Rosa leaps eagerly at the task, glad for the gap in the parental onslaught, kissing her mom on the cheek as she heads out of the kitchen. As she leaves, Rosa\u2019s mom reaches across the island, taking my hand in hers. I can feel the tremors in her grip as she squeezes down.\n\n\u201cAnon, thank you. I know I seem tough on you, but I need to, for Rosa. She\u2019s been so worried about me lately, and you\u2026 well, you gave her something to be happy about again. You know how she worries about other people, always putting others\u2019 needs before hers. It breaks my heart, seeing her worry, especially about me. You\u2019re\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s mother voice breaks a little bit, causing her to take a steadying breath. It\u2019s as if all the remaining strength has left her, leaving behind a husk of woman barely holding it together. \u201cYou\u2019re a very sweet, caring boy, for putting her needs before yours. Ay, listen to me! I sound like mi madre!\u201d Rosa\u2019s mom laughs, wiping away another tear. I don\u2019t think this one has anything to do with laughter, however. Before I can answer, Rosa shuffles back into the room, handing her mother a small black purse, glancing quizzically in our direction.\n\n\u201cMama, are you okay? An-on, what\u2019s-\u201c\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay Rosa, thank you sweetie.\u201d Rosa\u2019s mom quickly snatches her phone out of her purse, shooing her daughter over to me. \u201cOkay, now, pictures before dinner! Come, scooch, scooch! Say \u2018mi madre esta loca\u2019!\u201d In an instant that familiar mom-strength is back, and Rosa\u2019s mom is all smiles as Rosa and I pose for pictures. I can still feel those tremors, though, still remember the way Rosa\u2019s mother looked at me with pleading eyes.\n\nDinner itself passes by quickly, halted only momentarily as Rosa leads us in grace. The mole poblano is possibly even more delicious than the first time I had it; Rosa\u2019s mom having gone out of her way to procedure some chicken to add to mine, sparring me the soy-version that Rosa and herself were having. Before long, the three of us sat around their massive family table in the dining room, smiling and laughing as more family stories were spun out. Surrounding by pictures of their relatives, I could tell that Rosa and her mother shared a special bond that only a mother and daughter could share, one made all the more potent by Rosa having only brothers. I thought of the relationship I shared with my own family, of my mom and dad back in Rock Bottom, whom I hadn\u2019t seen for months now. For the first time in a long time, I didn\u2019t feel quite so alone. When Rosa announced it was time for her to drive me home, I realized that this house felt more like home to me than the sad, small apartment I had in Skin Row. \n\nI think it was at this moment that I know I loved Rosa.\n\nWalking around the dining table, Rosa\u2019s mom took the opportunity to plant a kiss on my cheek as she gave me the biggest mom hug I\u2019ve ever received. With promises to come again, I followed Rosa out of the house into the twilight of the evening, hesitating at the door to listen to the crickets chirp. It was nice to hear them again, so far out from the city. I couldn\u2019t help but stand in the light of the front porch, savoring the lack of my normal lullaby of sirens and crackhead screams. \n\n\u201cSo, An-on, did you have a good time? Mi madre seemed to like you, so that is good. Once he hears you won over Mama, Papi will welcome you with open arms.\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice interrupted my thoughts. I could see Rosa smiling at me as I stood there, her arms crossed beneath her breasts like she was waiting for something. I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle, watching her watch me. I was waiting for the same thing, after all.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny, mi novio? What, is there something on my face?\u201d I moved close to Rosa, our bodies almost touching. Slowly, I brush a strand of her shinning hair from her face, tucking it behind her ear. Rosa blushes at my touch, shifting her body slightly into mine. \n\n\u201cRosa, I had a wonderful time tonight with your mom. She really is a special woman. Just like you.\u201d Rosa\u2019s blush deepens as she rolls her eyes slightly.\n\n\u201cAy, An-on, such a cheesy line! But I had a good time with you, too.\u201d Our faces were almost touching at this point, Rosa\u2019s eyes beginning to close. My hands trailed up her arms, coming to rest on her shoulders. \u201cA very, very good time, An-on.\u201d Her lips parted as she reached up to me, my own mouth coming down to meet hers. \u201cKiss me, mi amor\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s arms crept up around my neck, pulling me even closer to her.\n\nThat was all the excuse I needed.\n"},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 6.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 6.txt"],"text":"The Garden of Rosa\n\nChapter 6\n\nThat bitch.\n\nTHAT BITCH!\n\nHow could Trish do something like this?! I know she hated me, was jealous of all the time I spent with Fang, but this\u2026?! Where did she even get those pictures of me? Just when things were looking up, Trish has to go and pull a stunt like that!\n\nThoughts of human-on-trigger violence fly through my head as Fang and Reed escort me to Spears\u2019 office. Fang still has her arms around me, her wings held half-out to shelter me from the shame. Reed\u2019s sneakers echo though the empty halls as he trails after us, a look of concern on his face. For once, he doesn\u2019t seem the least bit high, either. I don\u2019t know if I can trust Reed\u2019s story, that Trish got the slides from Naomi and inserted my cringy \u2018arm-in-arm with an anime girl\u2019 pictures, but for now I\u2019m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. For some reason, what Rosa\u2019s mom said to me keeps echoing in my mind, dissolving the anger I desperately wanted to lash out with. It would be easy, to snap at Reed, to call Trish a purple cunt to her face, but I know I can\u2019t; I couldn\u2019t do that to Rosa.  \n\nDamnit, I wish Rosa was here. Her and Stella got to the auditorium late, and the seats next to Fang and I already filled up by the time the two of them arrived. Rosa would know what to say, how to dispel the anger welling up inside of me. God, how I want to just sink into Rosa\u2019s loving arms, feel her chest rise and fall as she cradles me to her chest\u2026\n\nNice work Anon, thinking of Rosa even while Fang is sheltering you like a baby. Real class act. \n\n\u2026Ugh, how do I even begin to explain this to Rosa?\n\n***\n\nThe conversation with Trish in Spears\u2019 office wasn\u2019t as painful as I expected. Just looking at that triceratrollop made my blood boil, but I forced myself to stay and face her, to talk to her, trying to get her to understand that I didn\u2019t want to cause a rift in her friend group, that I just wanted to be Fang\u2019s friend, and hers too. Trish mumbled an apology to me as I turned to leave, stopping me dead in my tracks. Seemed like I wasn\u2019t the only one trying to be the bigger man.\n\nWe resolve to wait for Trish outside Spears\u2019 office, Fang, Reed and I. Fang still had some unspoken things to say to her, and truth be told I did as well. As we crouch down on the floor outside the office, Fang slowly pulls my head onto her shoulder, throwing her arm around me once more. I\u2019m too tired to protest at this point, and to tell the truth it feels nice, being held by Fang. Old feelings, feelings I\u2019ve thought were long-dead start to rise within me as I sit there, resting my head on Fang\u2019s bony shoulder, watching Rosa as she runs down the hall at me\u2026\n\nWait.\n\nFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK.\n\nI stand up at once, pushing Fang\u2019s arm off my shoulder roughly. The hurt look Fang gives me as Rosa pulls me into a tight embrace cuts deeply. Rosa is murmuring into my shoulder, a rapid burst of Spanish quickly giving way to something I actually understand.  \n\n\u201cAn-on! Oh thank goodness you\u2019re still here! I had to get away from class, had to make sure mi novio is okay\u2026\u201d I can hear the beginnings of a sob in Rosa\u2019s voice. Pulling her face-to-face, I give her my best reassuring smile.\n\n\u201cRosa, I\u2019m okay. Well, at least I think I will be\u2026\u201d I can see the look in Rosa\u2019s eye as her gaze flickers towards Fang, full of righteous indignation and not a little bit of jealousy. Fang matches her glare-for-glare, her amber eyes narrowing as her wings begin to bristle. Hoping to dissuade any future fighting, I step between the two women, taking Rosa\u2019s hand in mine. \u201cLook, Rosa, Fang and Reed had nothing to do with this. In fact, they helped me see why Trish did what she did. And what Trish did was shitty, but it\u2019s important you forgive her, okay? For me, for your novio?\u201d Rosa hesitates for a moment, the rage that was building in her soft crimson eyes slowly fading. Finally, Rosa sighs, nodding her head and giving my hand a squeeze. She steps around me, towards Fang, Fang slowly getting to her feet. \n\nFor an instant I think Rosa still means to lash out at Fang, but then Rosa pulls Fang into a hug as well, burying her face in Fang\u2019s chest as the ptero woman giving me a confused look. \u201cFang, I am so sorry, for thinking you had anything to do with this. I just know you and Trish are friends, and I let my anger get away from me. \u00bfAmigas?\u201d Rosa doesn\u2019t release her arms from around Fang, possibly preparing to suplex her if she doesn\u2019t agree.  \n\nFang hesitates a moment before answering, her face darkening. Fang\u2019s amber eyes catch mine for a moment, her eyes pleading like a drowning man search for a lifeline. For a second I stare at her, not understanding, before it hits me. \n\nFang\u2019s arm around my shoulder as we waited.\n\nFang\u2019s attempts at studying together.\n\nFang\u2019s glances my way in class, the way her hands would brush against mine, and a thousand other small, furtive things she did, each a little reflection of the things Rosa and I shared.\n\nFang likes me.\n\nFang\u2019s eyes ask a question over Rosa\u2019s head that, one she already knows the answer to but hopes I will say something to keep the question alive, to keep her hopes alive.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Fang.\n\nI shake my head slightly, a sad smile crossing my face. Fang\u2019s face falls, a look of dejected understanding filling her face. Slowly, her arms raise to return Rosa\u2019s hug, albeit briefly. I knew her words were meant for me as much as they were for Rosa.\n\n\u201cFriends, Rosa. Just friends.\u201d\n\nRosa released her hug, glancing up at Fang with a confused expression. She was interrupted by the sound of Spears\u2019 office door opening, a dejected and tear-stained Trish shyly keeping her face to the floor. Rosa\u2019s face erupts with rage once more, a string of Spanish expletives flooding out of her mouth as she half-lunges towards the smaller woman. \n\n\u201c\u00a1Perra! \u00a1C\u00f3mo te atreves! Cuando te ponga las manos encima\u2026\u201d\nTrish cowers back, her face a mask of pure terror. As much for Rosa\u2019s sake as Trish\u2019s, I step between the two women, my hands held up.\n\n\u201cRosa, please! This is something we need to talk about, together. Can you wait for us to finish before ripping Trish\u2019s head off?\u201d\n\nRosa stands there fuming, her eyes shooting daggers at Trish. Glancing back, I can see Trish starting to cry once more, her hands withdrawing into the sleeves of her hoodie as she scrubs her eyes. I can\u2019t help but feel sorry for her.\n\nWell, only a little bit.\n\n\u201c\u2026Fine. An-on, I\u2019ll wait for you by the exit while you talk.\u201d Rosa storms off, not before raising a threatening fist at Trish. The sound of sandals on the floor is the only noise left, the four of us standing around in silence. For a while, Fang just stares at Trish, before she eventually breaks the ice.\n\n\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe catharsis of talking with Trish faded quickly as I left to meet up with Rosa. Admitting that Fang was just a friend, that I didn\u2019t have feelings for her in that way, had hurt a lot, but in a way I was glad I got to talk to Trish about it. Knowing I wasn\u2019t going to try and take Fang away from her seemed to mellow Trish out a bit, and she even managed to give me a hug around the waist as we said our goodbyes. Fang had already left by then, saying she wanted to take a break from the band, just to clear the air between her and Trish. I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve handled crushing on Fang\u2019s hopes a second time today.\n\nGritting my teeth, I manage to keep my head down as I walk through the halls, ignoring the jeers and laughter of the students. Clearly news has spread throughout the lower classmen, and I shoulder the front door open amid calls of \u201cWeeb!\u201d and \u201cLoser!\u201d. Rosa is waiting for me a the entrance, her eyes brimming with concern as she pulls me into another hug. \n\n\u201cAww, An-on, it will be okay. Do you want me to take you home?\u201d The idea of wallowing in my shitty apartment alone doesn\u2019t appeal to me. Nothing waits for me there except video games and my usual Bolivian papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 crafting newsletter, neither of which have been holding my interest of late. \n\n\u201cMaybe we could talk a walk or something, Rosa. I just wanna be somewhere with you right now, and-\u201c\n\n\u201cHEY LOSER, THINK FAST!\u201d\n\nMy words are cut off by a shout. Turning towards the voice, a soda can fills my vision, and before I can react the can smacks me in the forehead, causing me to lose my already poor balance and tumble down the front steps of Volcano High.\n\n\u2026\n\nOw.\n\n\u201cAN-ON! Mi novio, are you hurt?! Can you stand? \u00a1Ay, C\u00f3mo se atreven esas peque\u00f1as mierdas!\u201d Rosa helps me to my feet, and I wince at the pain in my, well, everything. \u201cCan you walk? Should I call an ambulance?\u201d\n\nI try to put on my best cool-guy face, my breath coming in ragged gasps. My lungs feel like they are about to explode. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m okay Rosa, I can walk.\u201d I try to take a step and legs collapsing quickly underneath me, new pain blossoming across my body as I once again take a concrete nap. \u201cFuck!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u00a1Oh Dios m\u00edo! An-on, please, you are too hurt to walk. Let me help you over here, you can wait while I bring my car around.\u201d Rosa helps me to my feet once more, throwing my arm across her strong shoulders as she half-carries me to a nearby bench. Once again I\u2019m glad for Rosa\u2019s strength as I sit unsteadily down on the cold wood. \u201cI\u2019ll be just a second, okay mi novio?\u201d I nod, wincing in pain. Rosa plants a tender kiss on my forehead before rushing off towards the school parking lot. \n\nAlone with my thoughts waiting for Rosa to bring her car around, my mind keeps replaying the look Fang gave me in the hall. Again and again I run through it: The pleading in her eyes, just how devastated she looked when I shook my head. Is Fang going to be okay seeing me again? She hardly looked in my direction when she was talking to Trish, and left before I could say anything to her. I would hate myself if I was the one who broke our friendship apart, and Fang does mean a lot to me. Am I a jerk for letting her down like that? Not for the first time today, I wish I had never met Fang and the gang, that I had just kept my head down and coasted through to graduation. \n\nBut then I would never have been with Rosa. Is that what I want?\n\n\u2026\n\nNo. Despite everything that\u2019s happened, all the awkwardness between Fang and I, all of Trish\u2019s vitriol, all the physical pain I\u2019m in right now, I would do it all again in a heartbeat.\n\nThe sound of an approaching car interrupts my inner monologue, and seconds later I see Rosa pull up to the curb in her familiar ride. Rosa helps me make it to the passenger seat, even buckling my seatbelt for me when the pain of twisting down into the car proved too much for me to handle. Before long we were on the road, each pothole and bump in the road radiating pain up and down my body. But something was off: This wasn\u2019t the way to the address I had given Rosa in the past, the fake home I had invented to hide the shame of Skin Row from her. \n\n\u201cUh, Rosa, this isn\u2019t the way to my place\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not, An-on. I\u2019m taking you to my house, where I can nurse you to health properly!\u201d I can tell from Rosa\u2019s white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel and the stopsign she just ran that she\u2019s nervous, barely holding it together. In some ways, watching me hurt might be hurting her more.\n\n\u201cIs, uh, your mom going to be home, or are we\u2026\u201d I let my words trail off. \n\nRosa shoots me a nervous smile. \u201cNo, just us, An-on.\u201d\n\nI try telling myself the butterflies in my stomach are just a result of my injuries. \n\nThe rest of the trip out to Rosa\u2019s house pass by in relative silence, save for my involuntary curses at each bump on the road and Rosa\u2019s muttered apologies. As we approach her house, I can see distant figures in the fields stretching around her home, laboring in the sun. Mercifully, Rosa slows down when she hits the rough gravel of the drive; I\u2019m not sure my bruises could\u2019ve taken hitting that road at the speed Rosa was going. One bends up, tracking the car as it pulls into the open-air garage.\n\n\u201cUmm, Rosa, do your brothers know I\u2019ll be over?\u201d\n\n\u201cSi, si. I texted them when I was getting the car.\u201d Rosa moves quickly to help me out of the car, once again supporting my weight as we limp to the front door. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mi novio, I\u2019ve covered for them plenty of times they brought a girl home without Papi or Mama knowing. They won\u2019t bother us.\u201d Something in her words makes Rosa blush, some unspoken implication of just what her brothers were doing with those girls they brought home.\n\nThe house is quiet as we shuffle through the front door. The doorway isn\u2019t big enough for both of us to walk abreast, so Rosa walks backwards as she holds me up, our backpacks discarded in the entryway. There\u2019s no enticing smells emanating from the kitchen down the hall this time, a sure sign Rosa\u2019s mom isn\u2019t home. Slowly, Rosa leads me down the hall, past the dining room from the other day, to a room at the end of the hall. Opening the door behind her, Rosa guides me inside, the lights illuminating her room. A small writing desk sits underneath the window, opposite a bed sporting a homemade-looking quilt with a not-insubstantial amount of clothes pile on top. Pictures dot the walls even here; framed photos of her family sitting side-by-side with polaroid snapshots of her and Stella. A large crucifix hangs above the head of the bed, a colored depiction of Raptor Jesus on his cross of rock. \n\nRosa leaves me lingering in the doorway briefly to scoop up the clothes off the bed, carelessly discarding them into a hamper in the closet. \u201cSorry for the mess, An-on. Please, please, come here.\u201d Her gentle hands guide me to the bed, easing me onto the soft mattress. It feels like sitting on a cloud, compared to my bed at home. \u201cSit down, nice and easy, there we go. You just relax, An-on; I\u2019ll go get the medicine kit in the meantime.\u201d Rosa gives my hand a squeeze before heading back into the hallway, leaving me alone.\n\nIn her room.\n\nIn my girlfriend\u2019s room. On her bed.\n\nWith no parents in the house.\n\nI try to quiet the alarms in my head and the butterflies in my stomach by glancing around the room. It\u2019s nice to see this side of Rosa; nice to see that underneath the beautiful, caring exterior, Rosa is just as much of a messy teenager as I am. Something pokes me in the ass as I shift my weight on the bed, causing me to shift uncomfortably. Fishing it out, I discover it\u2019s a piece of clothing Rosa missed; namely, a massive lacy bra, red flowers sew carefully onto the black silk cups. \n\nJesus, I knew they were big, but damn\u2026\n\n\u201cAlright, mi novio, let\u2019s see how bad you-\u201c Rosa shuts the door to her room with her hip, a small white plastic medicine kit and a series of creams and poultices in her hands. Her face goes beet-red as she sees me sitting there, holding her unmentionable in my hands. Tossing the first-aid supplies quickly onto the nightstand, Rosa snatches the bra out of my hands, a flustered look on her face. \u201cT-that\u2019s not something you were supposed to see yet. No, wait, I didn\u2019t mean it that way! \u00a1Ay, c\u00e1llate An-on!\u201d Hiding her bra behind her back, Rosa waggles a finger in my face to stymie my laughter before shoving her bra in the closet. The laughter might hurt, but it\u2019s worth it.\n\n\u2026Okay, not worth it\u2026\n\nOw.\n\n\u201cAn-on, you must not hurt yourself like that! Come, her, take your shirt off and lie down.\u201d Rosa pats the bed as she sits on the edge, opening a jar of foul-smelling cream. Slowly, I pull my shirt over my head, reddening slightly as my skeleton-bod is on full display. At least my time spent gardening has given me some functional strength\u2026 I lie down on my stomach, Rosa hovering somewhere over my back. Rosa whistles softly, and I can feel her hands hovering over my body.\n\n\u201cOh, you poor chico! These look quite bad An-on\u2026\u201d A cold sensation spreads across one of my bruises, along with a shooting pain. I wince, cursing in spite of myself. \n\n\u201cGod damnit, ow!\u201d From this angle, I can barely make out the figure of Raptor Jesus staring down at me, no doubt disappointed at my blasphemy. \n\n\u201cSorry, sorry! I will try and be more careful, An-on\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s touch softens, and soon she finds the right amount of pressure to apply; not enough to cause me to flinch, but enough to work the soothing ointment into my aching wounds. The balm beings to warm, slowly draining the aches and pains out of my screaming muscles. No longer clenching my teeth, I relax, eyes slowly closing. Rosa\u2019s fingers feel nice as they trace the outline of each of my bruises, her fingers softly stroking my back. As my eyes finally close, I realize Rosa has begun to sing, a soothing Spanish tune evoking memories of when I was a kid, my own mom singing me to sleep. I can\u2019t understand the words, but I don\u2019t need to to understand what the song is: A melodic lullaby sung in time with her messaging fingers, full of compassion and love and kindness, meant to ease my aching soul. I don\u2019t dare interrupt, content simply to let Rosa finish her song, feeling the pain of my injuries fade. When she does finish, neither of us say anything, Rosa\u2019s fingers still tracing idly across my skin. \n\n\u201cThat was beautiful, Rosa.\u201d My voice is slow and soft, lulled into a trace as much by Rosa\u2019s song as by the soothing ointment. \n\n\u201cIt was the song Mama used to sing when\u2026 I was a little girl. She used to hold me in her arms and rock me to sleep whenever I was scared or in pain. It made me feel\u2026safe.\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice sounds husky, as if she is fighting back tears. The bed shifts slightly behind me. \u201cTurn over, An-on. I need to see your front.\u201d\n\nMy eyes slowly pull open as I roll over onto my back. Rosa sits back down, her legs straddling my groin on either side as she lowers herself down to my chest. Her hair cascades down, framing her face perfect amid those auburn curls. Something shines in her eyes, a look I haven\u2019t seen before. We\u2019ve been this close to one another before, but something about this is\u2026different, more intimate somehow, like the rest of the world has faded away, leaving only the two of us, together. Rosa begins tracing the wounds on my chest, and I can really smell the foul scent of the cream now. I can smell something else as well; Rosa\u2019s scent fills my head, an intoxicating aroma and I want to lean into. \n\n\u201cNot this time, mi amor. Just sit back.\u201d Rosa gently presses my chest back down, careful not to put any pressure on my bruises. I can feel her tail slowly curl itself around my leg, feel the weight of her body right on my crotch. Slowly, shifting slightly on my legs to hook her hands beneath her dress, Rosa begins pulling it over her head. Her eyes never leave mine as the dress is raised, slowly revealing a pair of green-and-white panties. Rosa\u2019s body has a slight pudge, just the right amount of thickness really; a white patch running ventrally down her front perfectly frames her cleavage and navel, and more besides. As the dress travels further up her body, Rosa\u2019s ample breasts plop free, barely contained in a silky, floral-patterned bra that matches her bottoms. Rosa pulls the dress higher, momentarily hiding her face before it goes up and over her head. Finally free, Rosa tosses the dress to the floor, slowly shaking out her hair as she fixes me with a smoldering stare.\n\nBy god, I\u2019ve never been so erect.\n\nSlowly, Rosa resumes rubbing my chest, leaning down to plant a soft kiss on each splotchy bruise as she does so. I\u2019m utterly transfixed by the sight of her body, my mouth handing slightly open as Rosa plants kisses further up my chest. I don\u2019t even care about my aching muscles anymore, the pain totally dispelled by the sexy, gorgeous woman sitting on my lap. Each time I try to rise, try to meet Rosa\u2019s lips in a true kiss, she pushes me back gently, until at last her face is hovering directly above mine. Rosa balances carefully, arms on either side of me, legs still grinding against my lower body, tail wrapped sensually up my leg. \n\nSlowly, Rosa leans down, plating a long kiss on my right cheek. \u201cThis,\u201d she says, \u201cis forgiving Trish.\u201d I can feel her hot breath as she travels over to my left cheek. \u201cThis,\u201d she whispers, \u201cis for letting me forgive her, as well.\u201d Rosa\u2019s lips are nearly touching my own now, her hands somehow having been transferred to my face without disturbing my bruises. \u201cAnd this, An-on.\u201d Her lips neatly press into mine for a moment before pulling back. \u201cThis is for the one I love.\u201d \n\nThis time, Rosa doesn\u2019t press me back down.\n"},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 7.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 7.txt"],"text":"The Garden of Rosa \n\nChapter 7\n\nSoft, golden sunlight poured through Rosa\u2019s window, spilling across the two of us as we lay on Rosa\u2019s bed. We had long since ceased out make-out session; I unfortunately discovered that it\u2019s pretty hard to smooch my thicc Latina girlfriend as she straddles my waist immediately after I attempted to impale myself on a metal bollard. Luckily, no one was around to hear my scream when Rosa\u2019s weight accidently slipped down to my chest. Instead, the two of us dozed happily off, content to sit in each other\u2019s arms as the day passed us by. \n\nRosa\u2019s eyes were closed, her head resting next to mine on the bed\u2019s pillow, a content smile on her face. She was singing again; her rich, musical voice pitched so softly that only I could hear. It was like my own private concert, performed for me by the true light in my life.\n\n\u201cEn el desierto un viajero de amor desesperado queria morir\u2026\u201d It was an old song, Rosa told me; something her dad used to sing as he worked in her family\u2019s personal garden out back. Rosa had spent as much time as she could with her father when she was a little girl, whether it was in the garden or just going out with him to town. The two of them were very close apparently, nearly as close as Rosa was with her mother. After having spent time with the two women I couldn\u2019t see how that was possible, especially because my old man hardly seemed to want anything to do with me. But, it seemed Rosa\u2019s family was filled with love and happiness, unlike mine.\n\nMy fingers traced a pattern on the small of Rosa\u2019s back, her dress still littering the floor. Just the feel of her skin on my hands was enough to sooth my aches and pains, and every so often I would plant a little kiss on her forehead, just because I could. I wanted to spend the rest of my days lying here, cradled by two loving arms that I\u2019d die for. \n\nIt was after one of these little kisses that Rosa\u2019s song stopped, her eyes opening to catch mine as I pulled away. Rosa had to peer up at me from her position on the bed, her deep crimson eyes shining with joy. Her smile matches mine as I gaze down at her, our hands finding each other, fingers entwining.\n\n\u201cAn-on, mi amor\u2026 I\u2019m very happy right now. Mmm, I could just lie here all day!\u201d Rosa snuggled her face into my shoulder, careful not to disturb any of my bruises on my bare chest. Rosa peppered my skin with kisses of her own, each soft touch causing my skin to tingle. \u201cWhat ever did I do to deserve such a nice novio?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just lucky no one else had scooped you up, Rosa. You\u2019re so beautiful, so kind, so loving\u2026I\u2019m serious!\u201d Rosa had begun to giggle, her laughter muffled against my neck. \u201cSeriously, Rosa, surely there was someone who caught your eye before. Or am I\u2026 your first boyfriend? Rosa?\u201d Her laughter was louder now, her hands moving to cover her face as she rolled away from me. \u201cHey! You know, it\u2019s not nice to laugh at your boyfriend like this, Rosa!\u201d\n\nRosa\u2019s laughter was slow to subside, nearly starting again when she caught sight of my pouting face. \u201cAww, mi amor, don\u2019t look so sad! It\u2019s just that, no one has ever said such nice things about me while also trying to pry into my past, you see?\u201d Wiping a tear from the corner of her eye, Rosa propped her head up on one hand, her large breasts straining against the taut strap of her bra. \u201cSi, An-on, I have had boys in the past who were interested in me. Mama did not like any of them, though; they were too irrespetuoso, too inmaduro. I always felt like they wanted something from me, too.\u201d Rosa\u2019s eyes were downcast now, her hand idly tracing on my chest. \u201cWith you, An-on, it\u2019s easy: I can just be me. You don\u2019t find my singing off-key, or get annoyed at how I slip in Spanish like some sort of mujer loca. And with Mama too, you were so kind, so understanding of how sick she is. You didn\u2019t try to tell me to just leave her alone, or\u2026or try to convince me to just let the doctor\u2019s do their work. An-on, you know how I need to help her! Dios Mio, An-on, she is my Mama, I can\u2019t just leave her\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice began to crack, her lips quivering, eyes still downcast.\nWincing, I turned myself to face her, ignore the pain in my chest as I rested my head on my hand. I could just reach my arm around Rosa to give her a gentle squeeze, mindful to not pull her too close. Those breasts could do some serious damage, pressed against my bruises. \nPlanting another soft kiss on her forehead, I searched for the words to let Rosa just how grateful I was that we were together. \u201cRosa, I don\u2019t know who those guys were, but they were all retarded to pass on you. I\u2019m serious, Rosa!\u201d Rosa\u2019s snort was soft, my words continuing straight over it. \u201cYou have so much love to give, those guys were idiots too ignore that. If you choose to give me just a fraction of the love you have to give, I would consider myself the happiest man in the world.\u201d Rosa was blushing now, slightly embarrassed by the mollifying praise I heaped onto her. \u201cAnd if you want to help your mom, if you need too, well\u2026 I\u2019ll be here for you, Rosa. I\u2019ll support you no matter what happens.\u201d\n\nRosa lifted her face to mine, the beginnings of a tear shining in each eye. The smile she gave me looked sad, as if the idea of helping her mom get through whatever sickness she had frightened her deeply. But still she smiled, locking those deep crimson eyes on mine as she shuffled her body closer to mine. \n\n\u201cGracias, An-on. I know I help too much, put too much of myself into others. It\u2019s nice to have someone who wants me to, for once. Even Mama and Papi try saying it\u2019s nothing, that they\u2019re fine. But I just want to help.\u201d\n\nIt was my turn to laugh. \u201cRosa, if you ever need someone to help, just turn to me. I\u2019m probably so messed up, you could spend your whole life trying to fix me. Ow!\u201d Rosa poked me hard in the chest, her finger digging into my skin; the fact that she was cautious enough to avoid my injuries did little to take the strength out of her poke. Angrily, she glared up at me, all sadness banished from her face. Lowering her voice, Rosa inched her face close to mine, eyes narrowing.\n\n\u201cAn-on, if you ever say you are messed up again, lo juro por Dios! You are so sweet, mi novio, so kind\u2026\u201d Our faces were very close together, now. \u201cI don\u2019t need to fix you, An-on. You are perfect, just the way you are. Oh, mi peque\u00f1o amor\u2026\u201d Our lips joined again once more, the passion of our kiss momentarily banishing all my aches and pains. Rosa was tender at first, content to meet my gentle kisses with ones of her own. Soon, however, her kisses grew fiercer and fiercer, until finally forcing her powerful herbivore tongue into my mouth. Smearing drool across my face, Rosa began to suck my lips greedily, gently biting them as she did. Her free hand grabbed mine, forcing it onto her ample chest even as her other hand slide down my body, going lower and lower until\u2026\n\nThe crunch of tires on gravel echoed through the open window of Rosa\u2019s room.\n\nIt was like cold water being dumped onto a pair of horny cats. At once Rosa pushed me away hard, ignoring my cry of pain as she flew to the window. Careful to not expose her nearly-naked body to the outside world, Rosa peeked around the curtain, her room possessing a decent view of the house\u2019s open-air garage. \n\nThe look Rosa gave me when she turned around nearly froze my blood in my veins.\n\n\u201cAn-on! It\u2019s Papi! He\u2019s home early!\u201d\n\nWhelp, I didn\u2019t need that erection anyways.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure my balls will retract from my body.\n\n\u2026\n\nEventually.\n\nAmid frantic mutterings of \u201cmierda!\u201d repeated over and over, Rosa began frantically putting back on her clothes, her hands shaking hard as she pulled the dress back over her head. Still partially crippled from my injuries, I searched around for my shirt, ignoring the stabs of pain as I doubled-over to look underneath the bed. Rosa finds it at least, throwing it at my face as she adjusts her hair in her bedroom mirror.\n\n\u201c\u00a1\u00bfC\u00f3mo pude haber hecho esto?! \u00a1Ay ay ay, Papi me va a matar! An-on, hurry up!\u201d Rosa was at my side, rapidly helping me to pull my shirt over my battered body. Somehow my arms had gotten tangled in the opening of my shirt, slowing the entire process down. I felt like my heart was going to leap out of my throat any second now. \u201cPapi can\u2019t see you in here!\u201d Shirt still covering my face, Rosa began to usher me out of her room, each shove eliciting another muffled cry of pain. Why the hell couldn\u2019t I get this shirt on?!\n\nHalfway down the hall I finally manage the herculean task of putting a shirt on, something five-year-olds accomplish with no issue. Not bad job, considering the circumstances, even if it was backwards. Rosa was practically dragging me by the arm the at this point, desperate to get me out of there before anything happened. Rosa looked terrified; her eyes wide and panic-stricken. I thought her dad was supposed to be cool with me? Something about her mother smoothing the way, or something. Maybe that wasn\u2019t true, or maybe Rosa was just freaking out over having a boy in her room without her parents knowing, but Rosa was clearly dreading her dad\u2019s sudden arrival. \n\n\u201cAn-on, come ON! Before he-\u201c The sound of keys in the lock cut her off, her face growing pale. We had just reached the entryway, hoping to grab my stuff and go; now, we were trapped, the\u2026thing in my shirt digging into my back like a twin-pronged pair of talons. Rosa just stared at the door, like her executioner was about to walk through.\n\nWell, maybe not HER executioner.\n\nReaching out, I have Rosa\u2019s hand one quick squeeze before the front door opened, revealing the source of our horror: Rosa\u2019s dad. Whereas Rosa was the spitting image of her mom, her dad bore only a superficial resemblance to her: The same crest of horns poked out from his head, more numerous than his wife or daughter, and the same tail dragged behind him, albeit one that looked like it could crush the life from my body with one squeeze. But that\u2019s where the similarities stopped. Rosa\u2019s dad lacked the peach-tone scales of the rest of the family I had seen, instead sporting a brownish-coloring across his exposed arms and face. His beak jutted further out of his stern face than any ankylosaur I knew, and evidence of his long time spent laboring in the field had given him a chiseled physique. His clothes were plain: just a simply pair of dusty workboots and jeans accompanying his light-plaid button-up. The mesh cap placed just-so between his horns read \u201cSoy Eggscellente\u201d.\n\nHis face was downcast as she stepped into the house, glancing down at his phone as he opened the door. \u201cRosa, bebita, I\u2019m home! Did your madre get anything for-\u201c His words cut off at once at the sight of us, just standing there. I became suddenly very aware of just how close I was standing to Rosa, but it was too late to take a step away now. It might\u2019ve been too late for anything, now. \u201cOh! Rosa, who is this? Rosa?\u201d His voice, surprised at first, had dropped to a dangerous level, and frankly I didn\u2019t blame him. If I came home to find a strange person in my house, let alone a human, I would want some answers.\n\n\u201cPapi, welcome home!\u201d Rosa hit her dad at full-speed, her hug knocking some of the wind out of him. A distraction attempt, I was sure, a way to momentarily get his focus off of me. \u201cThis is An-on, my friend from school, remember? The one Stella and I told you about when she was over for dinner?\u201d Releasing her dad, Rosa took a step back, placing herself between the two of us.\n\nStella, I swear to all that is holy, if you put a good word in for me, I will watch whatever anime you want.\n\n\u201cOh, si, si\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s dad looked more confused than anything, his red eyes darting between Rosa and I. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 nice to meet you, An-on.\u201d His words sounded clipped, as if he wanted to say something else entirely and thought better of it. The large ankylosaur crossed around Rosa, holding his hand outstretched. Attempting a weak smile, I accepted his handshake with as much composure as I could muster. His hands were nearly twice the size of mine, engulfing my own, the man\u2019s many calluses making me suddenly aware of just how soft my skin really was. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s uh, nice to meet you too, sir. Rosa just invited me over to\u2026 to, uh\u2026\u201d My words began to fail me under the inscrutable gaze of Rosa\u2019s dad. He still hadn\u2019t let my hand go, despite out handshake being over: He just held me in that powerful grip, not crushing me, but letting me know that there was no way I could break out of it. It slowly dawned on my that what I mistook for confusion in his eyes was actually judgment, a cold and calculation look that could only mean one thing: I know what you and my daughter were doing, and I am not happy about it. Rosa\u2019s dad probably knew a lot of isolated places out on the farm, plenty of plants that needed some extra\u2026 fertilizer.\n\n\u201cI just invited him over because he hurt himself, after school. Isn\u2019t that right, An-on? Right after school was over, you tripped down the stairs, si? An-on needed help getting better and he doesn\u2019t have a car and he\u2019s too poor for the bus so I took him here!\u201d Rosa\u2019s words pour out of her in a high-pitched, anxious voice. Moving to stand next to me, Rosa claps me on the back for good measure, causing me to wince in pain. I didn\u2019t dare break my gaze with her dad, however, the towering man in front of me cocking an eyebrow quizzically.\n\n\u201cTripped, huh?\u201d It\u2019s clear that Rosa\u2019s dad doesn\u2019t believe a word she\u2019s feeding him. I\u2019m really starting to sweat now, withering under his unflinching stare. \u201cRosa, did you push your novio down the stairs again?\u201d \n\nWut.\n\nAt once, his features split into a warm smile as he threw his head back in a booming laugh. Rosa\u2019s expression was as shocked as my own. \u201cAww, Bebita, you didn\u2019t think your Mama would forget to tell your old man about your new novio, did you? Come her An-on, let me greet you properly!\u201d His long arms wrap around my back, lifting me up into a big bear hug. Stars dance in front of my eyes from the pain before I\u2019m released, nearly collapsing to the ground before I can catch myself on Rosa\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cSo, An-on, you\u2019re dating my daughter, eh? I hope the two of you weren\u2019t doing anything our savior would disapprove of\u2026\u201d He pats something underneath his shirt, something that hangs on a chain on his neck.\n\nBefore I can gurgle out a weak protest, Rosa comes to my rescue. \u201cAy, Papi, why didn\u2019t you say something! Eres un gran malvado, making An-on think he was in trouble. And no, I did no push him down the stairs, some est\u00fapido at school caused this.\u201d Now that the immediate danger of her father disliking me is gone, Rosa gladly takes my hand, smiling towards me as her father laughs once more. \u201cPapi, don\u2019t laugh! It isn\u2019t funny!\u201d\n\nChuckling, Rosa\u2019s dad puts a hand on either of our shoulders. \u201cBebita, when you are older, with ni\u00f1as of your own, you will understand. Maybe An-on will be there too, ehhh?\u201d Rosa\u2019s dad and I share a grin as Rosa rolls her eyes, blushing despite herself. \u201cOh, now don\u2019t be like that! You are a beautiful woman, Rosa, and it\u2019s time you thought about starting a family. Your madre wasn\u2019t-\u201c\n\n\u201cYes, Papi, I know: When Mama wasn\u2019t much older than me, she was already married. Geez, Papi, you\u2019re embarrassing me!\u201d Rosa gives her father a playful punch in the shoulder, causing him to laugh again. \u201cAnyways, Papi, An-on probably needs to get back home, to rest up. Here, An-on, let me drive you home.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, Bebita, you are too kind! Always looking out for others, eh? Alright, go on, get your novio home. An-on, nice to meet you; come over anytime for dinner, okay?\u201d Another paternal handshake later and Rosa and I are out the door, her supporting me to her car. Although the hug and Rosa\u2019s insistent shoving during our flight out of her room didn\u2019t help my injuries, the creams and balms that were applied earlier seem to be having some effect.\n\n\u201cYou dad seems nice,\u201d I say as Rosa walks hand-in-hand with me to the car. \u201cWay nicer than I was expecting.\u201d Rosa pauses as she helps me into the passenger seat of her car. \n\n\u201cSi, he is a nice man. But I am his little girl, he is normally so protective of me! Mama must\u2019ve put in a good word for you for him to like you right at the start, An-on.\u201d Rosa joins me in the car, sliding into the driver\u2019s seat before keying the ignition on. \u201cSorry if he embarrassed you with those familia comments. He always likes to tease me.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what families are for, Rosa. My dad is always saying shit like that. Not the family comments, I guess. I don\u2019t think my parents ever thought I would give them grandkids.\u201d\n\nRosa blushes slightly as we drive down the main gravel driveway. Glancing at me sideways, Rosa seems more than a little embarrassed at what she says next. \u201cAn-on, about what Papi said: Do you\u2026 do you think about those things? About having a family, when you\u2019re older?\u201d\n\nI glance out my window before responding, watching as the rows of crops fly by. Turning back to Rosa, I give her my warmest smile, reaching over to place my hand on her thigh. Rosa pauses before getting on the main road, smiling back at me.\n\n\u201cOnly with you, \u2018mi amor\u2019. Only with you.\u201d\n"},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 8.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 8.txt"],"text":"Chapter 8\n\nWaving at Rosa\u2019s car as it drives off, I wince slightly at the continued pain in my ribs as I begin to limp home. I have yet to tell Rosa where I actually live, and the continual lie I have to feed her whenever she drops me off is starting to wear me out. Not to mention the several block walk home, my body screaming its displeasure at each step. The careful massage and rub-down that Rosa gave me on her bed seemed like a long time ago now, and I have to grit my teeth against the pain as I trudge up the steps to my dreary apartment.\n\n Flicking on the lights, the desolate emptiness of my apartment compared to the vibrant, well-lived hominess of Rosa\u2019s house only helps feed the sinking feeling in my stomach. \u201cI really should tell Rosa the truth about this,\u201d I mumble as I dump my backpack on the floor and collapse into bed with a groan. I can\u2019t continue hiding something as basic as where I live from her if I want to continue calling her my girlfriend. Rolling onto my back, I fish out my phone from my pocket, wishing I had Rosa\u2019s healing hands on me again as my muscles cry out in pain. Hoping she won\u2019t be too mad, I\u2019m already mentally steeling myself for the onslaught of angry Spanish that is sure to accompany my admission. \n\nStrange; I\u2019ve got a missed call from Fang, as well as a few texts from her. She must\u2019ve tried to contact me when Rosa and I were\u2026 Another groan escapes me as I think about Fang, and the way I had to break her hopes. Fang didn\u2019t leave a voicemail or anything for me, so it must not be urgent. Thumbing over to the messenger app, I pray to Raptor Jesus that everything is okay, images of Fang preening her wings flashing quickly through my mind.\n\nFang: Hey\n\nFang: yo wtf someone said you fell down the front steps at school?! \n\nFang: U okay dweeb :V ?\n\nThree messages, all from around the same time. Seems Fang still wanted to be my friend, at least. Scrolling down, I can read the rest of what she left for me.\n\nFang: Reed said Rosa took u home\u2026\n\nFang: Can we talk, tomorrow at school?\n\nFang: About us, i mean.\n\nFuck. I let the phone fall back onto my chest, staring at the celling. Fang wants to talk to me tomorrow, huh? Hopefully she didn\u2019t say anything to Trish about her feelings for me, otherwise I may not make it that long. Although, something tells me from what Fang said to Trish, neither of them will be speaking for a while.\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d I say again, out-loud this time. Seems no matter where I go, all I do is leave broken friendships in my wake. A buzzing on my chest pulls me out of my sulk, my heart quickening at a text from Rosa.\n\nRosa: I hope you are feeling better, mi novio! Papi wants to have you for dinner sometime. He\u2019s mad Mama already talked to you without him, lol.\n\nRosa: I wanna have you over too, mi amor~ ;)\n\nRosa: You just rest for now, though. You need your strength, An-on! I\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow.\n\nRather than cheering me up, Rosa\u2019s texts just made me feel worse about everything; how I lied to her about where I lived, about Fang and me, about how badly I wanted to see her again. Sighing, I barely manage to pour myself into my computer chair, my hands automatically opening a tab of my favorite Estonian el-presidente fan-forum. Maybe some shitposting will make me feel better\u2026\n\nNo. I force myself to close the tab, glancing back at Rosa\u2019s texts on my still-open phone. If I\u2019m going to improve, to be the best \u2018novio\u2019 for Rosa, I need to do better than shitposting. Instead, I open a list of florists in the area, my mind already thinking of what I can say in apology to Rosa tomorrow.\n\n***\n\nI feel well enough to make it to school the next day, albeit barely. My lukewarm shower did little to ease my aching muscles, however, and the walk to Volcano High was pure agony in my condition, but the events of last night kept me going. I owe it to Fang and Rosa both to face them today, no matter what. Not looking forward to talking to any other student given how much of my power-level was revealed, I skip the front door, instead heading to the school gardens. They were usually quiet before class starts, a place where I could avoid any comments about my photoshopping abilities. I message Fang as I walk, asking if she will meet me in the school\u2019s music room during lunch to talk. Lunch isn\u2019t for a while, and it will give me some time to think about the two women I\u2019m supposed to meet today. Easing myself down on a stone bench, I cast my eyes around to the many flowering plants that I helped Rosa and the Gardening Club plant earlier this year. Under Rosa\u2019s careful guidance, some are even already blooming.\n\n\u201cAnon! Hey Anon! Oh my god, are you okay?\u201d A familiar voice of a particular stego cuts through the silence of the gardens, and I can see Stella waving at me from further down the path.\n\nUgh. Make that three women I have to meet today.\n\n\u201cHey Stella. Yeah, I\u2019m okay, I guess,\u201d I mutter, suppressing a wince as wave back at her. Stella meant well, she really did, but her words of encouragement yesterday did little but add fuel to the fire of those jerks who jeered at me. Even with her face full of concern over my well-being, her bright blue eyes shimmering and her mouth pouting, I still slightly loathe the sight of her. If anyone saw us, the two biggest weebs of the school, talking together right now, I may never recover from what happened yesterday. \u201cStella, after I left yesterday, did anyone\u2026 I mean, were people still talking, about what happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean how everyone in school knows your waifu, or how you almost died falling down the stairs? Yep, people were pretty much talking about both!\u201d Stella seems incapable of reading my mood, her cheerful voice sounding particularly harsh this morning. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re afraid of, Anon! Everyone knows I watch anime, and no one\u2019s said anything mean to me for a while. Anyways, I think your waifu is sooooooo cute! Ohmygod! We should TOTALLY get together to watch some Anime sometime. I\u2019ve got the perfect show for us; I even made a cosplay outfit for it! It\u2019s about-\u201c\n\n\u201cStella, do\u2019ya think we could discuss the superiority of \u2018Grorious Nippon\u2019 later?!\u201d I sigh as Stella shrinks back from me, and I continue in more measured tone. \u201cI\u2019ve just got a lot on my mind, is all. Ugh.\u201d I scrub my eyes with the backs of my hands, attempting to miss the hurt look Stella was giving me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Stella, really. I\u2019ve just got to tell Rosa something today and I still kinda\u2019 need to prepare.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 That\u2019s okay, Anon, maybe we can get together at my house to watch it some other time.\u201d Taking a seat next to me, Stella swings her legs in the air, humming a little tune to pass the time. \u201cSo, what were you and Rosa going to talk about?\u201d My god, but could she not read the room a little?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d I begin, turning towards her. A sudden thought occurs to me: Stella is Rosa\u2019s best friend, right? And we\u2019re friends too. Maybe if I tell her that I\u2019ve been lying to Rosa about my squalid living conditions, she can help me decide what to say to her. A sort-of trial run. That way, if Stella totally thinks I\u2019m a creep, it can\u2019t get any worse.\n\nI hope.\n\n\u201cLook, Stella, here\u2019s the deal\u2026\u201d I break down the situation to Stella quickly: How much Rosa means to me, how great it felt being considered a part of her family, how I\u2019ve been hiding my Skin Row pad from her this whole time out of shame. Stella listened intently, her eyes laser-focused, only interrupting to ask for some clarification. Before long, I realize I\u2019ve spilled everything to Stella, not just about Rosa but my whole shitty family life in general. Mercifully, when I get to why I left Rock Bottom, Stella doesn\u2019t even comment about how much a massive weeb I really am.\n\nAfter I finish, Stella just sits there for a moment, her gaze vacant as she processes what I just said. Eventually, she takes a deep breath, as if to ease the words out of her chest. \u201cUmm, thanks Anon, for telling me those things about yourself\u2026.\u201d Her eyes downcast, I can tell she\u2019s slightly uncomfortable with how much I dumped on her just now. \u201cIt sounds like you really like Rosa, and her family. Which is great! Um. I\u2019ve never had a\u2026 you know, a b-boyfriend, but I think you really should tell Rosa about where you live, and your family stuff. She would want to know, you know? Couples shouldn\u2019t hide things from each other.\u201d\n\nNodding, I lean back against hard stone of the bench, wincing as the corner of the back digs into my bruises.  \u201cYou\u2019re right, Stella, thanks. It\u2019s just hard, all this couple stuff. Ugh, I mean, when I came here I didn\u2019t think I could find someone to love! And I don\u2019t even know the first thing about dating! All those dating sims are fuckin\u2019 useless, let me tell you\u2026\u201d I suddenly became aware that Stella was staring at me, a massive smile slowly spreading across her face. \u201cWhat? What did I say?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnon\u2026 you l-love Rosa?!\u201d\n\nI can feel the heat of my face as it starts to glow red. \u201cUmm, yeah, I mean, she\u2019s kinda-sorta said it to me, but I never-\u201c The rest of my excuses are cut off as Stella wraps her arms around my neck, hugging be back and forth as her ear-piercing shriek causes all the birds on campus to take flight.\n\n\u201cOHMYGOD THIS IS SO GREAT AHHHHHHHH! Anon, seriously, you are soooooooo CUTE!\u201d Stella is happily ignoring my cries of pain as she shakes me around like a rag doll, her squees reaching a level only dogs can hear. Finally, Stella lets go of me, leaving my neck feeling like it\u2019s been wrung out like a wet towel. \u201cAnon, you HAVE to tell Rosa about how you really feel! Here, let me help you. Tonight, this is what you can do\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore I could stop her, Stella started to break down how I could confess my love to Rosa, citing every anime trope in the book. The more I rolled my eyes at her suggestions, the cringer they got, the more I had to provide ideas of my own. No way in hell I was going to get Rosa into the school pool fully-clothed, and where the hell could I get that many butterflies?! Before long, I was as animated about planning the perfect night as Stella was, eagerly offering up ideas about how to best let Rosa know how I felt about her. Stella nodded along, listen intently to my ideas as the two of us slowly molded into an actual plan. Eventually, the first-period bell sounded, the claxon call putting an end to our conversation. I hadn\u2019t even realized how long we had been talking!\n\nAs we got up to head off to class, the two of us smiling like a bunch of dorks, Stella gave me one final hug of encouragement. \u201cAnon, you\u2019re gonna do great! Oh, I almost forgot!\u201d Stella rummaged through her backpack, pulling her precious tarot deck out at last. Rifling through it, she handed me a single laminated card. \u201cI want you to have this, Anon. I was going to do a reading for you, to see how things with Rosa would go, but I think I already know, now.\u201d Glancing down at the card\u2019s face, I could see two dinosaurs embracing in a kiss: It was \u2018The Lovers\u2019.\n\n\u201cStella, I can\u2019t accept this, what about your readings?\u201d Stella just smiled at my protest, already turning to leave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got others, Anon. Good luck! I bet everything works out, or you owe me an anime viewing!\u201d Stella was running to class now, a piece of toast inexplicably appearing between her teeth. Laughing, I waved goodbye, calling after her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deal!\u201d \n\n***\n\nThe rest of my morning classes pass by in a blur. I barely even notice that Trish isn\u2019t in Math this morning, her empty desk next to Reed suggesting she was taking the day off. I thought I was okay with what Trish did, but not seeing her in class just made it more apparent she felt guilty for the shit she pulled. Fang wasn\u2019t in music class either, her empty chair making ME feel guilty this time. I didn\u2019t know if she was skipping today as well, as Fang hadn\u2019t messaged me back today, but I just hoped wherever she was, she was doing okay. \n\nRosa took it upon herself to escort me between classes, her presence protecting me from the jeers of the rest of the school somewhat. Everyone feared being hit upside the head by Rosa\u2019s shoe, so they mostly left us alone, pretending like I didn\u2019t even exist. Rosa always left me with a squeeze of my hand and quick peck on the cheek, her warm smile as she waved goodbye to me making me feel even worse that I lied to her. Man, this day couldn\u2019t be over fast enough\u2026\n\nFinally, the lunch bell rang at last, releasing me to my fate. I trudge towards the music room, vainly attempting to tell myself that the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach was just hunger at skipping lunch. Peering through the window, I could see Fang sitting in the music room alone, tuning one the classroom\u2019s guitars.\n\n\u201cFang? Hey, it\u2019s me.\u201d I say, pushing open the double-doors. Fang doesn\u2019t glance up from the guitar, acknowledging me with a little wave of her free hand instead. Thank Raptor Jesus there\u2019s no blood on her wings.\n\n\u201cHey, Anon.\u201d Her voice sounds quiet, morose, as if she\u2019s been dreading this as much as I was. \u201cSorry to hear you got yourself beat up by an inanimate object.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll survive; we humans always do. Look, Fang, about us,\u201d I take a seat next to her, causing Fang to look up from her tuning. Her eyes look slightly puffy, as if she had been crying. \u201cFang, if I ever did anything to lead you on, to make you think we could be\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, okay?\u201d Fang sniffs quietly, rubbing her eyes with her hand quickly before putting on a small smile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Anon. I just thought it could be different with you\u2026 You saw through me, to the real me, and it was nice.\u201d Fang resumes tuning the guitar, twisting and plucking until she was satisfied. \u201cI liked having someone see me for who I was for once, not who they wanted me to be or who I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Fang began to strum mindlessly on the guitar, the tuning finished. \u201cI thought, maybe you saw me like that because you, um\u2026 B-because you liked me, is all.\u201d Random chords echoed through the classroom, a discordant melody to match Fang\u2019s mood. \u201cWhen you and Rosa started going out, I thought there might still be a chance, because you were always by my side, helping me through the bad times. So when I got to help you through your bad time, my feelings just kinda poured out, you know?\u201d The melody shifts, the song familiar. It was the song Fang had composed on the roof, the one she played just for the both of us. \u201cBut it\u2019s over now. All of it is. I told Trish I need to take a break from the band, to get away from her for a while. I\u2019m sure you want to do the same, to take a break from us, to spend time with Rosa\u2026\u201d The song fades, and Fang just sits there, staring at the guitar in her hands, tears streaming down her face. \n\nThe silence stretches out between us for a moment. I know it would be easier, to just put some space between Fang and myself. There\u2019s a lot of drama to unpack, and some time apart would do us some good. Fang still had Reed, and I had Rosa now, so it would probably be okay. Just a few days, at most\u2026\n\nNo. I know what I want, and not being friends with Fang isn\u2019t it. \n\n\u201cNo, Fang, I don\u2019t want to take a break from you. Or anyone in the band, even Trish.\u201d Fang looks at me, surprise flashing across her face. Her mascara is already running, leaving black streaks down her cheeks. \u201cFang, you are the closest friend I\u2019ve got here, and I don\u2019t want to throw that away for anything, not even Rosa. Yeah, she means a lot to me, more than I could ever know, but you\u2019re still apart of me, too.\u201d I reach out a tentative hand, placing it on Fang\u2019s shoulder. She flinches back slightly, before letting my touch linger on her. \u201cDo you know what I said at the beginning of the year? I said I didn\u2019t want any friends. I just wanted to be alone, to coast through the year by myself. But that\u2019s not what I want, not really. I just wanted a family, and friends who supported me, friends who I can support, too. So I\u2019m not taking a break from you Fang, not now, not after we graduate.\u201d Fang places her hand on mine for a moment before letting it drop to her lap. \u201cFace it, you\u2019re fuckin\u2019 stuck with this skinny, like it or not.\u201d\n\nFang laughs suddenly, a rippling snort like tearing cloth. \u201cEven if you and Rosa get married and have like, a bazillion kids or something?\u201d Her voice is quiet, a tender feeler searching for a small ray of sunshine in the darkness of her life.\n\n\u201cNot even then. You know I can\u2019t carry a tune to save my life, and someone has to accompany Rosa\u2019s singing.\u201d Both of us are laughing now, Fang no doubt imaging just how bad any of my musical attempts would be. \u201cI think you would get along with her, Fang, I really do. Maybe not, like, now, but sometime later, it might be nice, yeah?\u201d\n\nFang gives me a smile, one that begins to ease the sadness in her amber eyes. Streaks of tears and make-up mar her pretty face, and her eyelids are a puffy mess, but Fang still looks beautiful, sitting next to me. I feel\u2026 happy, that I\u2019m able to make her happy, able to help a true friend when she\u2019s down. At this moment, I know that our relationship has passed into a new phase, that we could never go back to what we had before. Both of us had accepted the other into their hearts, not as lovers or anything like that, but as familia.\n\n\u201cYeah, that would be nice. But no double-dates, dweeb, I don\u2019t want my future boyfriend to know how much of a dork my first crush was.\u201d Fang punctuates her verbal jab with a physical one, a playful poke in my thankfully uninjured shoulder.\n\n\u201cDeal.\u201d I pull a pack of tissues from my bag, handing them to Fang. She accepted them with a laugh, and I\u2019m glad I planned ahead this time. \u201cSo, did you just skip music class just to avoid me?\u201d\n\nDabbing at her eyes, Fang gives me \u2018don\u2019t-flatter-yourself\u2019 look. \u201cPfft, you wish dweeb. No, I was talking to Spears, about maybe playing at Prom at the end of the year. I think it would be cool, to show everyone how far I\u2019ve come.\u201d Fang studied her dirty tissue for a moment, the fingers of her other hand idly tracing the strings of the guitar. \u201cMaybe VVORM DRAMA could play together by then, even\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d like that, Fang.\u201d Fang looks up from her now-shredded tissue, studying my face. Smiling at her, I pull her into an awkward hug, the guitar hanging between us. After a moment Fang hugs me back, a brief exchange between two old friends.\n\n\u201cMe too, Anon. Me too.\u201d\n"},"Garden Of Rosa Chapter 9.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Chapter 9.txt"],"text":"The Garden of Rosa \n\nChapter 9\n\nI walked Fang to her next class after the lunch bell rang, the two of us chatting like normal. It was nice, getting back to the way things were with Fang, the awkwardness brought on by the previous day\u2019s conversation dispelled by our heart-to-heart. Fang even stood up for me when some girl brought up my waifu picture, clipping her books out of her hand with a well-placed wing before we both ran, laughing. \n\n\u201cSo, how\u2019s Trish taking this whole \u2018break\u2019 thing?\u201d I asked, panting slightly as we finally made to Fang\u2019s next class. You\u2019d think with all the time I spent outside gardening with Rosa, I would develop a little more endurance.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not taking it too well.\u201d Fang glances at the other students as they filter by, the bell sending many of them scurrying to avoid being tardy. Fang and I are well past caring about anything as lame as that, however. \u201cTrish was my best friend for a long time, but it\u2019s gonna be a while before I can forgive her for what she did. Besides, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m quitting the band, just taking a few days for things to cool off.\u201d \n\nI nod along, leaning against the wall with Fang. \u201cStill, not cool what she did to me. If you or Rosa didn\u2019t walk with me to class, I think the back of my head would be nothing but spitballs.\u201d A passerby glances in our direction, stifling a laugh as they hurried to their next class. Fang provided a middle finger of encouragement towards their back before turning back to our conversation.\n\n\u201cYeah, Rosa will have your back Anon, her and me both. Are you guys\u2026hanging out, after school today?\u201d I could tell by the way that Fang was intently studying her boots that the topic of Rosa and I together was not her first choice of conversation topics.\n\n\u201cUmm, yeah, actually. There\u2019s something I need to come clean to her about, so I\u2019m gonna ask her to meet me in the gardens after school.\u201d Suddenly it was my own turn to become engrossed with my shoes.\n\n\u201cPfft, you dweeb. Didn\u2019t anyone ever tell you not to keep secrets from your girlfriend? Oh, shit, sorry\u2026\u201d Fang\u2019s playful punch landed on one of my bruises, causing me to nearly double-over.\n\n\u201cGahh\u2026 Ffffffang, you did that on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d \n\n\u201cPlease die.\n\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re first, dweeb. Anyways, good luck with Rosa, Anon. Seriously.\u201d Fang\u2019s apologetic hug helps ease my pain a bit. As we break apart, Fang turned to enter her class, seemingly indifferent that she\u2019s now a few minutes late. \u201cI\u2019d hate to see you two break up, you make a cute couple.\u201d  As the door swung open, Fang raised her voice for one final verbal jab. \u201cRemember, use a rubber dude!\u201d \n\nThanks Fang, so glad your entire class heard that. \n\n***\n\nThe butterflies in my stomach only increased in intensity as the clock ticked down to the end of school. Rosa responded happily to me text asking her to meet me after school, no doubt expecting something a little more pleasant than my admission of guilt. As the final school bell released me at last, I hobbled as quickly as I could to where Stella and I had talked before, the stone bench serving as our rendezvous.\n\nStella was already waiting there for me, a wrapped bundle of flowers in her hand. She had agreed to pick them up for me during her free period, promising that she knew Rosa\u2019s taste in flowers better than anyone. The bouquet was beautiful, vibrant shades of red and yellow flowers arranged tastefully amidst a collection of other plants. I could recognize only one: the Middlemist Red Camilla, her favorite flower. \n\n\u201cHey Anon! Just like you asked, Rosa\u2019s favorites. Don\u2019t worry, you can pay me back for them later.\u201d Stella\u2019s voice is upbeat and cheerful, the stego clearly more excited for what\u2019s about to happen than I was.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, thanks Stella.\u201d I had totally forgotten I needed to pay her back; this bouquet looked like it cost a fortune. I held it awkwardly in the crook of my elbow, the massive arrangement nearly dwarfing the size of my head.\n\n\u201cGood luck Anon! And remember: It\u2019s important to share the truth with Rosa, even if it hurts. She can\u2019t understand you until you let her in.\u201d Stella gives me a double-thumbs-up of encouragement before heading off, leaving me standing alone in the garden. Now that school was over, and with no Gardening Club activity scheduled today, I was the only one left among the carefully cultivated plants. Alone, surrounded by the gifts Rosa and worked her whole time at Volcano High to produce.\n\nA familiar sound behind me makes me turn around, the rhythmic slap of sandals across the pavement heralding Rosa\u2019s arrival. I remember at the last second to hide the bouquet behind my back, the massive assortment of flowers no doubt peeking around my slim frame. Rosa looks even more beautiful among the flowers, their own radiance somehow enhancing her own. I can\u2019t look away, captivated by her kind eyes, her beaming smile, the cute way she plays with her backpack straps as she approached me. \n\n\u201c\u00a1Hola, mi novio!\u201d Rosa greets me with a quick kiss, not quite rising on the tips of her toes to do so. \u201cSooo, do you have something for me?\u201d Swaying back and forth, Rosa bore an expectant look, having no doubt seen my gift for her.\n\n\u201cUm, these are for you, Rosa\u2026\u201d Careful not to disturb the flowers too much, I present the arrangement to her, watching as her mouth drops open excitedly. \n\n\u201c\u00a1Dios Mio! An-on, they are beautiful, thank you!\u201d Rosa pulls me into a half-hug, the flowers held carefully away. \u201cAww, you are such a sweet boy, An-on. Even when you are the one hurting, you bring me flowers.\u201d Rosa inhales deeply, savoring the fragrant smell of the bouquet.\n\n\u201cActually, um\u2026 Rosa, there\u2019s something else that\u2019s been hurting me.\u201d I motion to Rosa to sit with me on the stone bench, trying my best to ignore the concerned look in her eyes. I take a deep breath before I begin, knowing that when I start, I will have to finish. \u201cRosa, I haven\u2019t been entirely honestly with you. Do you know the place where I live?\u201d I wait for her to nod, confusion building on her face. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t live there, not really. I, uh, I live in\u2026 in Skin Row. Yeah, the bad part of town.\u201d Rosa just wants for me to finish, her brows knitting together. \u201cWhen we fist started dating and you drove me home, I didn\u2019t want you to see where I live. I mean, that place is a shit-show, Rosa, really it is. And I guess I just got so caught up in not wanting you to know that I just kept lying to you. I\u2019m sorry Rosa.\u201d \n\nSeconds pass, the ornamental fountain the only sound in the gardens. Rosa just stares at me, her crimson eyes searching for something on face, perhaps for some greater lie. She\u2019s not yelling yet, which is a good thing, no Spanish shrieks or anything. And both sandals were still on her feet. I may just avoid the worst of it\u2026\n\n\u201cWhy, An-on? Why did you lie to me?\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice was soft, full not of anger but with disappointment. Her eyes were sad, the wonderful smile slipping quickly from her lips. Even her body looked sad; her shoulders sagging, her hands idly plucking at the leaves of the bouquet. \n\n\u201cRosa\u2026 I think it\u2019s because I was ashamed, when we first started dating: Of who I was, where I lived. You were this amazing, beautiful, sexy woman, and you had picked me, of all people, and I just felt like I was letting you down just by being me. So, I lied about where I lived, thinking that maybe if I could hide that part of myself from you, I could hide everything else. But I know now that\u2019s not how a boyfriend should be, not how a familia should be, and you deserve the truth, Rosa.\n\nSo, for the second time today, I spilled my guts out on that stone bench in the gardens. Rosa didn\u2019t say a word as I laid out my life\u2019s story, from my shitty home life to my equally shitty school life. She just listened, just like Stella, just like Fang. For the first time in my life, people listened to me, really listened, and no matter how hard it was at the beginning, it was nice to be heard.\n\nBy the end of my diatribe, my voice had become scratchy and weak from so much talking. I waited for Rosa to say something, anything, praying that she wouldn\u2019t be too mad. Finally, Rosa stood up, grabbing me and hauling me up by the hand, a bossy look on her face.\n\n\u201cShow me, An-on. Show me where you really live.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe drive over to my part of town didn\u2019t take long. I connived Rosa to park a few blocks away, with the understanding that the last thing she needed was to have her car stolen while visiting her boyfriend\u2019s shitty apartment. Still clutching the bouquet, Rosa follows me in silence, still sporting that same bossy look. Sheepishly, I unlock the door, flicking on the lights as I wave Rosa in.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Casa Del Shithole.\u201d\n\nMercifully, the room\u2019s not in too bad of shape. Only a few dirty dishes remain in the sink, and the bed is MOSTLY made. Viewing my room through Rosa\u2019s eyes, I can tell how empty it looks, the walls utterly devoid of any decoration save for an old wooden cross nailed to the wall by a previous tenant. Except for the appliances I brought with me, nearly everything else in the room was there when I arrived in Volcaldera, all those months ago. To Rosa, someone whose house was filled with evidence of life and love, this must look like a prison.\n\nRosa still hasn\u2019t said anything yet, casting her eyes across everything in silence. I didn\u2019t dare say anything first, instead content to wait with my hands in my pockets, watching her take everything in. Eventually, Rosa walked to my desk, setting the bouquet down with care before rounding back on me, a look of pure rage in her eyes.\n\n\u201c\u00a1Estupido! An-on, how could you hide this from me?!\u201d To punctuate her words, Rosa slaps me across the shoulder, the loud slap ringing in the desolate apartment. \u201cDo you really think I care where you live?! As if I wouldn\u2019t go out with you, just because you lived in the bad part of town! \u00a1Estupido, tonto chico!\u201d\n\n\u201cOW! Rosa, I\u2019m sorry, really \u2013 Ow!\u201d I try to shield myself from her blows, wincing wherever her smacks impact one of my bruises. I could feel my legs bump into my bed as I backed up underneath the onslaught.\n\n\u201c\u00bf\u00a1Ay, que voy a hacer!? To think, I fell in love with such a stupid, stupid boy!\u201d Rosa\u2019s slaps were getting harder, and worse still, her shoe was coming off.\n\n\u201cOw! Really, I\u2019m sorry! I love you too, Rosa, please-\u201c \n\nAt once the blows stopped. Rosa stood there, shoe up-raised and ready to strike, her chest panting from the effort of pummeling me. Her bossy look had returned, this time her cheeks flushed.\n\n\u201cSay that again,\u201d she ordered, her voice quiet. \u201cSay what you just said again, An-on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you Rosa. I know I haven\u2019t really said it before, but it\u2019s what I wanted to say, today.\u201d\n\nRosa slowly lowered her shoe, letting it fall from her hand as she stared at me. I could see tears beginning to well up in her eyes, that bossy look slowly fading away. \u201cAy, you really are a stupid, stupid boy, mi novio.\u201d Rosa\u2019s hands guide me down onto the bed as she straddles my lap. Her dress is shed is seconds, followed quickly by the rest of her clothing. \n\n\u201cNo, no mi novio. Mi amor.\u201d"},"Garden Of Rosa Ending 1.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Ending 1.txt"],"text":"Imagine if you will, a world where Anon had refused Fang the commiseration she so desperately desired in the music room. A world where Anon cared little for any of his friends besides Rosa, a world where Anon had ignored the lives of others to focus on his own fortunes. Ignorant and blind, Anon grew increasingly na\u00efve about the pain Fang was in, instead bragging about his QT-Latina Dino GF on his favorite Botswanan nickel-collecting usenet.\n\nThis, is the ending for that Anon.\n\n***\n\nThe Monday after Prom dawned, a morose collection of grey clouds darkening my usual walk to school. Prom certainly had been eventful, to say the least. Shame about VVURM DRAMA\u2019s performance, though. I wouldn\u2019t say Fang had been excited to play; no, she seemed more nervous than anything when we talked before the show, and I guess for good reason. When she walked out on stage wielding her bass instead of her guitar, I knew nothing good could come from it. \n\nBut hey, at least Rosa and I had a good time, before the band\u2019s ill-fated performance. God, she looked so beautiful in that dress! And despite my distinct lack of any ability, I managed to make her laugh on the dance floor, my imaginary reload animations entertaining her throughout the night. I even considered asking her back to my place, maybe seeing where the night took us\u2026\n\nNah, it was probably for the best we all went home. Seeing Fang getting pelted with punch really pissed Rosa off, and Spears had to step in to separate her from the unfortunate bastard who had thrown the last volley. I hope Stella was able to calm her down back home after they dropped me off. Still, not a bad night, all things considered. The picture I posted of Rosa and I got me a new record: Thirty-Five (You)\u2019s. Not bad at all, if I do say so myself. \n\nStill riding high with smug self-satisfaction from this morning\u2019s harvest, I quickly found myself at my destination. Trudging through the halls of Volcano High, I dump my stuff at my locker before checking my phone for any texts from Rosa. We usually met up in the morning for a bit, if only so I could get away from Fang and the gang. Things had gotten awkward around her since I shot her down, and I couldn\u2019t imagine how painful today would be for her. Everyone jeering and laughing at her, at the band, maybe even some additional ammunition thrown their way. No, better to butt out and let them be, right\u2026? \n\n\u2026\n\nThumbing to my messenger app, I can see I\u2019ve already had a few from Rosa.\n\nRosa: Morning An-on! Thanks for last night, I had a great time!\n\nRosa: I hope Fang is doing okay though :(\n\nChuckling to myself, I shot a message back. That was just like her, always worrying about other people.\n\nAnon: I wouldn\u2019t worry about it, Fang is tough, they\u2019ll survive.\n\nRosa: \u2026I hope so.\n\nRosa: \u00a1Mira eso! Fang needs to see me in the library before school, I can ask how they\u2019re doing then\n\nRosa: See you later, mi amor!\n\nDamn, no time to see her this morning, I guess. Shrugging, I pull open my favorite shit-posting site, comfortable with the knowledge that I still had a few minutes before I had to get to class. A ripple through the assembled students drew my eye away from a particularly juicy Stony thread: It was Naser, sporting an uncharacteristically haggard look on his face. The Prom King ignored the well-wishes of his peers, instead charging up to me, his voice edged with panic.\n\n\u201cAnon, have you seen Fang?\u201d Naser was fidgeting with his backpack, constantly scanning the crowd behind me. \n\n\u201cUhh, not today, no. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, they never came home after Prom. I didn\u2019t notice at first, because Naomi and I were\u2026\u201d\n\nYep, it\u2019s better you don\u2019t finish that sentence Naser.\n\nCoughing, Naser continued, his face reddening. \u201cI saw what happened to them, and I tried to help but Trish just told me to fuck off. Naomi wanted to take my mind off of them so we went to an after-party, and by the time I got home Fang still wasn\u2019t there. Shit Anon, they haven\u2019t answered a single one of my texts!\u201d\n\nNaser showed me his phone, scrolling through his messages. It must\u2019ve been nearly fifty texts there, all sent to Fang between Prom and this morning. And all unread. Maybe her phone was dead?\n\n\u201cDad and Mom are worried sick. Dad\u2019s even put out a missing persons report on them this morning. I just checked with Trish and Reed and they don\u2019t even know where they are and I\u2019m fucking freaking out Anon!\u201d Naser rubbed his face with his hands hard, dragging his eyelids down as he did so. I could see the stress building on him; he looked practically ready to explode. \n\nI knew Fang was the type to skip school, but to not come home for an entire day? Where could she have been? Shaking my head to banish those thoughts, I gave Naser a consolatory smile, flashing the texts from Rosa.\n\n\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t seen Fang yet, but hey, look: Rosa said she just got a text saying to meet them in the library. Maybe check there?\u201d  \n\nVisibly sagging with relief, Naser steady himself with a hand on my shoulder. \u201cThank Raptor Jesus, Anon\u2026 You don\u2019t know what I was going through, what Dad was putting me through, trying to find them!\u201d The tired ptero gave me a weak smile, one I returned with a clap on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll walk with you. See Naser, it\u2019s gonna\u2019 be fine!\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe library was on the second floor of the school, a dusty room at the back of the building. Truth be told, I hadn\u2019t been here since getting caught torrenting anime on the computers. I guess that\u2019s probably why I was barely scraping by in math\u2026 Posters lined the entrance of the library, some still advertising Prom, others outlining the library\u2019s summer reading program. Leaving an agitated Naser to ask at the front desk if they\u2019d seen his sister, I let my gaze wander across the stacks, each one creating a separate hallway. It was faint, but I could hear something\u2026\n\n\u201cLibrarian said she say Fang here right when the place opened, but they didn\u2019t say what they were looking for.\u201d Naser joined me at my side, following my questing glances towards the stacks. Sighing, Naser shrugged his backpack further on his shoulder, his one broken wing forcing him to hold it awkwardly. \u201cLook Anon, you don\u2019t have to help me look for them, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\nHolding up my hand for silence, I strained my ears, listening intently. It sounded like an argument, somewhere at the back of the library, the stacks of books muffling it just enough that I couldn\u2019t really get a sense of who it was. But, if I knew anything about Fang\u2026\n\n\u201cListen, Naser. Do you think that\u2019s Fang?\u201d I hissed, trying to keep my voice quiet under the watchful eye of the librarian. Naser paused, his stare fixed to the floor. Suddenly, he was striding towards the source of the argument, not pausing to answer me. \u201cNaser, wait!\u201d\n\nStill half-walking, half-running, Naser and I arrived at the source of the disturbance quickly. The closer we got, the more we could understand what was being said, the more we could understand that it was Fang doing most of the talking.\n\n\u201c\u2026didn\u2019t ask for him to come in here and fuck with my life! I didn\u2019t ask for these feelings! But then you just fucking stole him away, didn\u2019t you?!\u201d\n\nWho was Fang talking to? Wait\u2026 As it dawned on me, I started to run, Naser close behind me. Rosa!\n\nRounding the last stack, we found what we were looking for. Fang was standing with her back to us, arms waving animatedly, a terrified-looking Rosa backed into the end of the row. Rosa\u2019s crimson eyes were brimming with tears, a stricken look on her face. Neither woman had noticed us yet, but before I could take a step towards them, Naser flung out an arm to stop me, his gaze transfixed by something in Fang\u2019s hand.\n\nOh.\n\nOh fuck no.\n\nFang held a steely grey revolver in her hand, the barrel pointed loosely towards Rosa. After a second, Fang must\u2019ve realized we were standing there, snapping the gun towards the both of us, a mixture of rage and fear spread across her face. Naser and I froze, standing together at the end of the row, facing down a barrel of a gun. Fang\u2019s gun.\n\n\u201cWhoever it is, stay the fuck\u2026\u201d Fang\u2019s arm slackened slightly, the barrel wavering. Behind her, Rosa whimpered wordlessly, struggling to fight back her tears. \u201cAnon\u2026You\u2026You weren\u2019t supposed to be here.\u201d For a moment, Fang looked confused, gazing at nothing. \n\n\u201cFang\u2026just put the gun down, okay?\u201d Naser took a hesitant step towards her, palms held outwards. \u201cAnon and I are just here to help\u2026\u201d\n\nFang seemed to regain her composure at Naser\u2019s words, the revolver snapping back up towards him. Fang\u2019s mouth was a locked in a snarl, her face equal parts disgust and anger.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what I am to you, Naser, just some broken girl you can fix?!\u201d Fang was really screaming now, no longer attempting to hold her voice down. Please, please let the librarian call campus security\u2026\u201dWell guess what?! No one can fix me, Naser! Not you, not Anon, and especially not you!\u201d Fang\u2019s hand whipped back around towards Rosa, causing her to shrink back against the wall in fear. \u201cYou! You treat me like I don\u2019t even exist, just like the rest of them, but now that you\u2019re his fucking girlfriend, you suddenly want to be friends?! You think you can just worm your way into my heart, like he fucking did?!\u201d Rosa\u2019s eyes were closed now, screwed shut against Fang\u2019s onslaught. \u201cFUCK YOU!\u201d Screaming, Fang cocked the hammer of the gun, spittle flying out of her mouth as she did so.\n\nWhat happened next was a blur. As Fang primed the revolver, my stupid protective instincts took over, and I only knew that I couldn\u2019t let anything happen to Rosa. Rushing up on Fang, I tried to grab the gun from behind, the two of us struggling around before\u2026\n\nThe shot rang out in the library like a bomb, rattling the metallic shelves and leaving my ears ringing. Fang looked stunned, standing there slack-jawed, staring at what she had done, the gun slipping from her hands even before I realized what was happening. Then I saw it. \n\nRosa, my love. \n\nRosa, the only one who had seen me for what I could be, rather than what I was.\n\nRosa, crumpled into a ball on the ground, holding both hands to her chest.\n\nI couldn\u2019t scream, no matter how much I tried. My tongue felt like felt in my mouth, my chest devoid of air. All I could was moan, an incessant droning noise that seemed to come from everywhere at once. Scrambling over to her, I scooped Rosa into my arms, holding her tight against me. God, how she shook, each rasping breath bubbling inside of her before being expelled with a spray of blood. Rosa looked up at me, her crimson eyes pleading. Crimson, just like the\u2026 No, focus on her eyes!\n\nI could see her mouth moving fitfully, trying to form words, more crimson spilling out onto her face. My hand was wet, sticky. When had I moved it? I didn\u2019t dare look anywhere but her eyes, my own futile attempt to block out what I could not deal with. Rosa\u2019s hand honed into view, moving in little shaky bursts towards my face, unable to find what she was reaching for. Why was everything so blurry now? Lowering myself to her, Rosa caressed my cheek one last time, just she had done so many times before, her mouth finally finding the words.\n\n\u201cMi\u2026amor\u2026\u201d\n\nI rocked her back and forth like a baby, the sweet smell of her hair lost amidst the smell of blood.

A world where Anon still held Rosa\u2019s parents in disregard for how they treated him, a world where Anon had been nearly an unwilling participant in his relationship. Scared and sad and withdrawn, Anon increasingly withdrew from his Dino GF, turning to shitposting on his favorite Canadian leaf-raking forum instead.\n\nThis, is the ending for that Anon.\n\n***\n\nThe day of the wedding was fast approaching. There still were a million things to do, and despite our efforts it didn\u2019t seem like the list got any smaller. The only solace Rosa and I took was in each other, stealing off to my apartment most nights to get away from Rosa\u2019s family. Rosa\u2019s parents had nearly disowned her when they found out about\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say that the convictions Rosa once held so dear did not stand up to her own desires for long, especially once I convinced her that we were practically married already. Why not get a jump on it, I thought? I almost apologized, holding a crying Rosa in my arms when her mother was finished screaming at her through their front door, but hadn\u2019t we both know the risk?\n\nOpting to save some cash, all things considered, I decided on renting the arboretum gazebo for the wedding, an idea that Rosa seemed to take to in an instant. She often visited there, with or without me, watching the field of wildflowers flow in the breeze for hours. Rosa had been forced to get a job right out of high school to pay for the wedding, and what little she saved still went to her mother\u2019s treatments. She didn\u2019t want to let them go, no matter how much I argued that we could use the money more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s MY money, mi amor! I choose what to do with it!\u201d Rosa had screamed at me one night, somehow embedding her flip-flop into my apartment wall. MY money. Those words had hurt; Rosa knew I was looking for a job as much as I could, but pickings for a barely-educated skinny were slim. It seemed a lot of lower-skilled jobs went quick, and I was competing against a lot of folks, a competition a weak human was likely to lose.\n\nIncreasingly, I relied on the help of Reed and Naser. I had chosen them to be my best-men at my wedding, unable to decide between them. And while I appreciated the extra help, Rosa was growing increasingly annoyed that I was, in her eyes, \u2018shirking my duties\u2019 in preparing the wedding. But Naser and Reed had cars, and what did I have? Nothing but my Xrox and toaster; one which I put to good use looking up wedding stuff, and the other I put to a more important use of helping me stay sane through all of this. Reed and Naser has accepted eagerly, for their credit, willingly heading out on whatever errand I couldn\u2019t manage to do. \n\n***\n\nFinally, at last, the day was finally here: A sad, miserable weeb like me was getting married! I could hear the excited thrill of the guests beginning to arrive, see them walking up to the gazebo where dozens of small plastic chairs had been set up. Reed, Naser and I were waiting in a small grotto that served as the Groom suite, standing around in out best suits and ties, each sporting a familiar red flower in our buttonholes. \n\nDespite everything, though, I felt\u2026 off. A part of me knew that this was supposed to be the best time of my life, my special day, but I could only look towards the future with a sense of dread. What would happen if I couldn\u2019t get a job, couldn\u2019t support Rosa or our\u2026 Shit, how was I going to support myself? A man could only live off shitposting alone for so long. The worst thing was, I couldn\u2019t even talk to Rosa about this. I don\u2019t know if her emotions were a result of the wedding or the other thing, but she had been on edge for weeks now. She even had to pick up an extra shift at her job, to pay for the flowers she had picked out. Fuck, if only my parents had actually thought to send me some money for all of this\u2026\n\n\u201cSoooo, Anon, getting excited, bro?\u201d Reed was rocking back and forth on his heels, his patent leather shoes squeaking each time he did so. Glancing over, he flashed me that stupid grin he always wore. His suit looked good on him, a far side better than it looked on me, that was for sure. \u201cGetting\u2019 close to the fateful hour!\u201d Squeak. Squeak.\n\n\u201cYeah, Anon, you should be happy!\u201d Naser clapped me on the back, shooting me a big smile. I tried to return it, only managing a grimace. \u201cRosa\u2019s a great woman, Anon, and you two are going to be very happy.\u201d\n\nNaser\u2019s words, meant to placate me, instead sounded mocking in my ears. Sure, the two us may be able to be happy, but what if it\u2019s more? I had to force myself unclench my jaw, to keep my hands in my pockets. Fuck, my emotions were just as much on edge as Rosa\u2019s!\n\n\u201cShame you\u2019re parents couldn\u2019t make it, bro. That\u2019s real harsh\u2026\u201d Squeak. Squeak. Squeak.\n\n\u201cReed, now\u2019s not the time, okay?\u201d Reed held up his hands in a mocking semblance of innocence at Naser\u2019s admonishment. \u201cAnon\u2019s got a lot of things on his mind, I\u2019m sure, so let\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem, bro, no problem.\u201d Squeak. Squeak. Squeak. \u201cSo, Anon, you know what you\u2019n\u2019Rosa are doin\u2019 for your honeymoon?\u201d Squeak. Squeak. SQUEAK.\n\nThrough gritted teeth, I manage to mumble something, mind racing. Fuck, the honeymoon! We had talked about going to Mexico, to visit Rosa\u2019s family, but that was before she dropped that little surprise on me. Could she even fly, then? Could we even afford it? Figures whirled in my head, a whirlwind of numbers and expenses and costs and\u2026\n\n\u201cAnon, you okay?\u201d Naser\u2019s voice was flush with concern. Sure, daddy\u2019s little rich boy worried about his poor friend. Like Hell I could tell him about it.\n\n\u201cYeah, bro, you wanna\u2019 sit down or something?\u201d SQUEAK. SQUEAK. SQUEAK.\n\n\u201cSure, yeah, I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m totally fine. You know what, I may even be great! Isn\u2019t this great, getting married, starting our life together!\u201d Shrugging Naser\u2019s hand off my back, I walked to the edge of the grotto, leaning against a towering oak that sat on the edge of the small space. \u201cIn fact, I love it! All the pageantry of the day and shit, all the little things that just build and build and build until it\u2019s all I can think about!\u201d Somewhere, someone was shouting, a very rude thing to do before a wedding.\n\n\u201cAnon, calm down, it\u2019s just -\u201c\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just WHAT, Reed? Hmm? Answer me this, what is THIS?!\u201d Spreading my arms wide, I tried a panicked laugh, the strangled sound coming out more like a sob than anything else. \u201cIs this something you think I can do? Do you think what\u2019s in store for me is going to be easy?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026It\u2019s not supposed to be easy, Anon.\u201d Naser stumbled slightly over his words, but his eyes narrowed dangerously at me. \u201cIt\u2019s something you have to work at, together, you and Rosa.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat! That\u2019s great!\u201d The other two jumped as I slammed my fist into the trunk of the tree, my frustration spilling over. I could feel my body begin to shake, as if my very soul was attempting to reject the words coming out of my mouth. \u201cOh yeah, me and Rosa! What a great pair; someone who has their fuckin\u2019 life together, and me! Just some dumb fucking kid, who has no idea what he\u2019s doing!\u201d Again and again I hammered my fist into the study oak, pounding on that rough bark as if the answers I sought lay underneath. I could feel hot tears running down my cheeks, matching the smears of blood on my hands. Before long I was pounding both fists into the unflinching tree, attempting to beat my feelings into submission. In place of words, a primal wail escaped my lips, my own personal dirge sung to the herald the death of my love. Sagging against the bark, I leaned on both hands, head downcast as I watered the earth with my tears. \u201cWhy did I think I could do this\u2026\u201d\n\nNeither Reed nor Naser moved to comfort me. I was sure they were afraid, not for what I was doing, but what I was saying. They had seen Rosa and I grow close together, helped us with our relationship when needed. It was doubtful they could understand just what I was saying. Utterly spent, I collapsed to my hands and knees, eyes staring at nothing.\n\n\u201cBro\u2026\u201d Reed said at last. Half-turning my head, I saw the pink raptor take a step towards me, hand held hesitantly out as one would approach a dog, one they weren\u2019t quite sure was rabid or not. Taking an audible gulp, Reed tried flashing me his best laid-back smile. \u201cYou sure this isn\u2019t like, pre-wedding jitters, my man? I\u2019ve got something to calm you down\u2026\u201d My hands dug into the rich earth involuntarily, dispelling his smile in an instant. \n\n\u201cAnon, you\u2019ve got to get a hold of yourself.\u201d Naser\u2019s voice was cold, his voice straining with the effort of keeping his own emotions in check. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how the Anon I know would act.\u201d As I rose to a kneeling position, I could see his hands clenched in fists. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what Rosa deserves.\u201d\n\nHow fucking dare he tell me what she deserves! \u201cAnd what is it she deserves, Naser?! Does she deserve a good man, someone she can trust? Because that sure as hell isn\u2019t me!\u201d I didn\u2019t even recall moving through the space between us, but my hands found Naser\u2019s lapels, shaking him roughly. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking get it, you fucked-wing retard! I\u2019m a fucking loser! A-\u201c\n\nMy ramblings were cut short by the sound of Naser\u2019s fist meeting my face. Ears ringing, I stumbled backwards, feeling the blood begin to flow from my not-quite broken nose. Naser stood in front of me, chest heaving, his fist still hanging in the air from the punch. The front of his best black suit stained with dirt and blood. Suddenly, I was aware of just how closely Naser resembled his father, in both looks and brawn. \n\nNone of the three of us said anything for a long time. I hunched back, like the stricken animal I was, mopping blood from my nose on my sleeve. Reed just stood there, his mouth a thin line of disappointment, eyes fixed on me. It was a long time before Naser straightened himself, turning his back on me without a word and walking back towards the ceremony grounds. I didn\u2019t even bother to stop him, to apologize to one of my closest friends. I just watched him go, blood still streaming down my face. \n\n\u201cAnon\u2026\u201d Reed croaked at last, his voice sounding like he was attempting not to cry. He started to say something, mouth working wordlessly before he gave up, dropping his gaze. Turning slowly, Reed moved to follow Naser, holding his elbow like he always did when he was sad. This time, I didn\u2019t even bother to watch Reed go; I just ran as fast as I could, stumbling over rocks and bushes and anything else in my way. The further I ran, the more my vision blurred, silent tears joining the blood that ran down my face. After a while, I reached the entrance to the arboretum, where the taxis were assembled to take the guests to the reception. Not even bothering to see if it was occupied, I flung open the door of the nearest cab, a dingy beat-up old car that looked slightly familiar, before throwing myself in the back seat.\n\n\u201cHey, bud, you can\u2019t just- Wait!\u201d It was that damn driver, the one who had ferried me all throughout Volcaldera this past year. His familiar goatee and eyebrows were waxed, and it looked like he had dressed for the occasion, sporting a hideous black and yellow suit. Glancing up from his want ads, the driver glared at me through the rear-view mirror. \u201cAin\u2019t you the groom? What\u2019s the matta\u2019, kid?\u201d\n\n\u201cDrive. I don\u2019t care where, or how much or when you stop: Just get me aware from here.\u201d And with that, I collapsed across the length of the back seat like a broken toy, giving in to the misery that had been plaguing my soul. As the cab drove away, I didn\u2019t even bother to look back. \n\nA single Middlemist Red Camilla lay in the street, crumpled and abandoned.\n\n***\n\nAfter I left Rosa standing at the altar, single-handedly running what was supposed to be the best day of her life, my own life lost all meaning. Unable to stand living in my old Skin Row apartment anymore, I quickly moved out, abandoning most of my furniture. The whole thing was tainted by the promises I had made, by the love I pretended to feel. As I stood there in the doorway, looking back at the sad, pathetic room one last time I could\u2019ve sworn I could smell her scent, one last time\n\nSad and pathetic, just like me.\n\nAfterwards, I drifted from dead-end job to dead-end job, spending time in whatever unskilled position I could bother to apply to. Motels became my home, now, or the backseat of the Junker I managed to buy off of Cragslist. For three long years, I was a emotional nomad, not allowing myself to feel anything. Perhaps I did it out of penance for what I had done, for the ultimate sin I had committed, but I knew the truth: That it was because that was what I was, a nobody, an empty shell that for a few glorious months had been filled with Rosa. At least, before my cracks had begun to leak.\n\nIt was on one of these dead-end assignments that I found myself back in Volcaldera. The city had changed since I was away: More trash in the street, more homeless lining the sidewalks. I took it all in with the same apathetic gaze I looked at everything now, not caring about the things I saw, the thing I had become. I could barely remember what the job I had applied for was, except that I was supposed to be here. A three-week stint back where I was happiest, back in my own personal Hell.\n\nThe sky above was like a television screen, tuned to a dead channel. Wanting to conserve my gas, I pulled into a random park; or as I often called them, my new home. I would have to move each morning, never parking too long at any one spot, least the cops took me in. I learned that lesson the hard way, a year or so back. Numbly, I stared out of my windscreen, having long since grown oblivious to the spiderweb cracks that spread across the glass. Thinking of the cops reminded me of Ripley, Fang\u2019s dad. Is he still the police commissioner here in Volcaldera? \n\nNo, best not to think about those times. Too many wounds inflicted on those people, too much agony spread by careless hand. Settling the seat back, I resigned myself to a few hours\u2019 wait until my shift started, content to let the world pass me by, unmoving and uncaring as a stone. Seems I pulled into some park: Figures moved outside of my car, families and happy couples out for a stroll, no doubt averting their eyes from the shambling mound that was my mobile home. \n\n\u201c\u00a1Ay, mi beb\u00e9! Come back here!\u201d\n\nI felt something, the first tiny spark of emotion that I\u2019ve felt in a long time. Whether it was fear or hope, I didn\u2019t know, but I could feel it consume me as I stared out through the spiderwebs. In an instant, that numb facade I had erected vanished, defeated by a familiar voice.\n\nThere was no doubt in my mind it was Rosa out there, chasing after her son. MY son. The little boy resembled his mother, but the more I stared, the more I could tell he was different: His eyes more human than dino, his horns mere little nubs jutting out from his bald head. He was running fast, making Rosa half-jog to catch up to him, giggling all the while at the trouble he was causing. The clothes he wore looked like hand-me-downs, the kind you\u2019d fine at a thrift store, and I could tell he was already outgrowing the pair of little shoes he was wearing. How many outfits had he gone through already?\n\nThe years had not been kind to Rosa, either: She looked worn-out, no doubt from three years of being a single mother, her eyes sallow, her cheeks gaunt, her once luxurious hair reduced to a poorly-maintained rat\u2019s nest tied behind her. Even her clothes were in poor repair, punctuated with holes and worn along the edges. Clearly every extra dime Rosa had was going towards the little one she was currently chasing. As she finally caught up to him, I could see why: Anger dispelled, Rosa scooped him up in her arms, giggling right alongside with him as she tickled his stomach until he screamed with laughter. It was like all of her troubles were suspended for that brief magical moment, the purest moment of love I\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nAs Rosa cradled the toddler she and I made together, he eyes flicker across the row of parked cars in front of her. Reflexively, I flinch below the dash, making sure she doesn\u2019t see me. Would she want to see me, now? After all I did, after what I must\u2019ve put her through. Would she want me in her life, in her son\u2019s life? A deadbeat skinny dad, barely able to hold a job for more than a few weeks, barely living paycheck to paycheck. I can just picture it now: Rosa and my son standing there as I sweep out of my car dramatically, a look of joy on their face as I stride over to them. \u2018Why yes, I am your long-lost father who ran out on your pregnant mother and left her at the altar, how could you tell?\u2019 And Rosa would forgive me, because of course she would, Rosa would forgive anyone, would love anyone\u2026\n\nJust like she loved me.\n\nAs the scenario plays in my mind, I realized exactly the emotion I had been feeling. It was so clear, now, The sight of the family I abandoned, the thought of t admitting I had made the worst mistake of my life. It wasn\u2019t hope or excitement I was feeling, it was dread. Lung-paralyzing, soul-crushing dread. The first emotion I had dared to feel in years, and it was possibly the worst one I could ever imagine.\n\nWatching my one-time wife and forever-son playing in the park, I managed to start the car, the engine turning over at last. Peeling out of my spot, I turn to do what I\u2019m best at: Running away. \n\nGoodbye, Rosa. It wasn\u2019t nice seeing you, after all.\n\n\u2026\n\nI hope you didn\u2019t name him after me."},"Garden Of Rosa Ending 3.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Ending 3.txt"],"text":"Imagine if you will that it was Rosa, not Anon, who needed someone to rely on, someone to hold them and tell them everything is going to be okay.

Three years I been away, forced to find a job overseas, forced away from the love of my life, my fiancee.

A three-month certification program as a welder\u2019s assistant kept the lights on for a while, but when my journeyman assignment took me overseas, we were forced to make a horrible decision.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll come back to me, mi amor, right?\u201d Rosa had said as I boarded the train to the airport, hugging me tightly. \n\n\u201cOf course, Rosa. It\u2019s just three years, that\u2019ll be over before you know it.\u201d The lie sounded hollow to my own ears, and the words tasted sour in my mouth.\n\n\u201cWhen you get back, meet me at our place, An-on.\u201d With the final boarding call sounding over the loudspeaker, we finally broke our embrace, both of us fighting back tears. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you, mi amor.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be waiting for it.\u201d\n\nA sudden jolt knocked me out of my memories. The cab had stopped, the familiar gates of the arboretum standing before me. Closed gates. The sun was already being to fall behind the arboretum hill, where Rosa would be waiting for me.\n\n\u201cAlright kid, we\u2019re here.\u201d The cabbie\u2019s eyebrows had gotten longer, somehow. \u201cWhy\u2019d you wanna\u2019 come here anyways? Ain\u2019t this place closed today?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m meeting someone,\u201d I replied, my voice terse as I counted out the fare. Shouldering my heavy duffel bag on my shoulder, I paused on the curb, my heart falling. In place of the simple swing gate from three years before, the arboretum now sported a heavy seat of large iron gates. No way I could hop over that thing, no matter how much better shape I was in. And Rosa wasn\u2019t anywhere in sight, either. Had she forgotten?\n\nRolling down the passenger window, the cabbie leaned over to me, concerned. \u201cIt, uh, don\u2019t look like she\u2019s here, friend.\u201d His words echoed my worst fears come to life. \u201cYou need me to take you somewhere else? No extra charge friend, just name the address and you\u2019re there.\u201d Motion out of the corner of my eye stopped me before I could respond, the motion of someone walking up to the arboretum gates from the inside. No, not walking: Running.\n\n\u201cAn-on? AN-ON!\u201d \n\nIt was like the world stopped turning, anything and everything else just falling away. Cabbie forgotten, and leaving my luggage where it dropped, I sprinted over to the gates, seeing my amor to the same. It only took us a second to reach each other, but neither of us wanted to be apart for any longer than we had to.\n\n\u201cAn-on, it is you! Oh, Dios m\u00edo, I thought I\u2019d never see you again\u2026\u201d Rosa looked much the same as I remembered: The same crimson eyes, so full of compassion, the same beautiful face. Really, the only thing that had changed were her clothes, Rosa now decked out in earth-toned pants and tank-top, the uniform of an arboretum employee. I couldn\u2019t help but ogle Rosa\u2019s cleavage, the fabric of her top stretched taut against her breasts. Hey, she was my fiancee, after all! A faded blue bandana completed her look, no doubt preventing her shining auburn hair from getting in her face as she worked. \u201cOh, Mi Amor, how I\u2019ve missed you!\u201d Reaching her hands through the bars of the gate, Rosa held my cheeks, stroking my face like she always did.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too, Rosa,\u201d I whisper back, ignoring the squeal of tires as the cab sped away. My face already hurt from grinning. \u201cYou look amazing Rosa, that uniform really suits you. Say, do you work here?\u201d Oh, how I longed to hear that snort of half-contained laughter\u2026\n\n\u201cAn-on, I do no know if I missed your little jokes. But, yes, I do work here. Here, let me unlock the gate\u2026\u201d Pulling her hands back, Rosa fished out a heavy key-ring from her belt, quickly unlocking the padlock that kept the gates closed. Swinging them open, Rosa nearly flew into my arms, wrapping her arms around my back as we both stood there, content in the other\u2019s embrace. Her hair smelled just as wonderful as I remembered\u2026\n\nEventually, we broke apart, holding hands as we stared at each other. I loved seeing Rosa like this after being apart for so long: Smiling, happy, her eyes free from sadness. For too long before I left, her mom\u2019s illness had left little room for joy in Rosa\u2019s life, but these initial moments of our reunion gave me hope Rosa could find some happiness once more.\n\nSuddenly, a mischievous look crept over Rosa\u2019s face as she stared at me. \u201cWell, An-on, aren\u2019t you going to kiss me? Aren\u2019t you going to kiss your novia?\u201d she said, her eyes twinkling. \n\nLaughing, I was all too happy to oblige.\n\n***\n\nThe sun was nearly set by the time Rosa and I managed to\u2026collect ourselves. Turns out, the arboretum had bumped up security in the years I had been away, installing those front gates in an effort to prevent trespassing teenagers. The plus side was, Rosa and I had the entire park to ourselves, and free from any prying eyes, we decided to get reacquainted with one another in the arboretum\u2019s small ticket booth.\n\nRosa studied her reflecting in the ticket-booth window, adjusting her hair. Her blue bandana was where she had left it, wrapped around my bicep. \u201cAy, An-on, I don\u2019t remember doing THAT with you before you left!\u201d I nuzzled her neck as she finished fixing her hair, sending her giggling as I planted little kisses down her shoulder. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just like riding a bike. Or, I guess, riding a-\u201c\n\nRosa didn\u2019t let me finish, elbowing me in the stomach. Wheezing, I doubled-up comedically, pretending to steady myself against the ticket booth as Rosa turned back to her hair.\n\n\u201cAy, An-on, tu estupido chico.\u201d\n\nSmiling, I straightened up, noticing for the first time a dark bruise on Rosa\u2019s back, only partially hidden by her top.\n\n\u201cRosa, what happened?\u201d I asked, catching her gaze in the glass as I tapped her bruise gingerly.\n\nShe hid it well, but a brief flash of fear shot across Rosa\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, An-on, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Rosa spun quickly to face me, wrapping her arms around my neck. I could still see the bruise in her reflect, the dark splotch against her pale scales drawing me in like a beacon. \u201cCome here, I want to show you what I\u2019ve done with the place!\u201d \n\nFor the next half-hour, Rosa leads me through the arboretum, pointing out all the changes she had instituted in the time she\u2019d worked her. It seemed Rosa managed to land the job through her volunteering connections, Principal Spears giving her a glowing recommendation due to Volcano High\u2019s success with their gardens. Raised beds and planting boxes littered the grounds; a dizzying array of local plants of all types, and each with a little description of how they helped the local ecosystem. Edging the path were rows and rows of wildflowers, their colors alternating like some sort of botanical rainbow, and lighting had been added to the paths, each streetlamp flickering automatically to life at dusk. Apparently, the arboretum had been long overdue for these changes, but no one had had the drive to implement them. Recalling all the hours I toiled under Rosa\u2019s watchful eye back in high school, I could understand how she accomplished this in just three short years. \n\nAs we down the path, I could see a subtle change overcoming Rosa. Instead of energetically chattering away, Rosa was becoming more and more subdued, only chiming in to answer the questions I posed. At first I assumed she was just content to walk hand-in-hand with me once more, but the more I studied her out of the corner of my eye, the more I recognized that all-too familiar sadness beginning to creep back into her face. Not waiting to see her distraught, I tried engaging her in conversation once more.\n\n\u201cRosa, I can\u2019t believe you did all of this!\u201d Pausing, I idly finger the waxy leaf of a bush I didn\u2019t even know was native to this area. \u201cWhen did you have the time to plan all of this?\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 Ever since you went away, An-on, I had to take my mind off of you leaving, so I threw myself into my hobbies.\u201d Rosa\u2019s head fell, a shadow passing across her once-happy face. \u201cAnd a few months after you left, Mama\u2026passed away.\u201d Sniffing, Rosa looked back to me, wiping away a tear as I squeeze her hand in solidarity. \u201cI couldn\u2019t handle it, for along while; none of mi familia could. Papa just withdrew in on himself, my brothers started to leave; the farm started to struggle. I helped out with the farm for as long as I could, but Papa, he wouldn\u2019t let me help the person who needed it the most: Him.\u201d Rosa stared sadly at all that she had helped to build, all the natural beauty and splendor she brought to the city. For a long while she said nothing, just standing there, hand-in-hand with me, before eventually drawing a shuddering breath. \n\n\u201cYou see, An-on, plants are easy,\u201d Rosa said at last, her voice quiet. Bending down, Rosa longingly stroked the petals of a wildflower. I squatted down on my heels beside of her, our fingers still interlinked. \u201cPlants will take all the love you can give, unconditionally. If they get sick, you can fix them; if they need something, you can give it to them. They won\u2019t push you away, until it\u2019s too late.\u201d Rosa and I sat by that flower, her crimson eyes staring at nothing, my own eyes watching her recount how her life had been ripped apart. \u201cFixing the farm was easy, An-on, but I couldn\u2019t do it all by myself, not without mi familia\u2019s help. But no one wanted to come back, no one wanted to see Papa in that state, to see Mama\u2019s empty chair on the porch, or her pictures on the wall. Eventually, it was just me and Papa, alone in the house, or out in the fields. Papa pretended to be strong during the day, but every night he would start to drink, and then\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s hand twitched reflexively up her arm, creeping towards the bruise that she had tried to keep hidden. How many more did she have?\n\n\u201cRosa\u2026\u201d I began, attempting to keep a tight hold on the anger that mounted inside of me. I had been away for longer than we had known each other, away from the one woman whom I loved more than anything in the world, but to come back and find out that her dad had been.... Life had changed Rosa, taken the kind, gentle soul that I fell in love with and hardened it. \u201cRosa, I won\u2019t let anything else happen to you, not anymore.\u201d I tried to keep the edge out of my words, tried to keep them reassuring. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about what happened to your mother, for not being there for you. I can\u2019t imagine what you went thro-\u201c\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me, An-on.\u201d Rosa\u2019s interjection was quiet, her voice strained. I could see tears beginning to fall down her face once more, as she continued to stare at that small, sad flower. \u201cPlease say you\u2019ll be here, by my side, mi amor.\u201d My hands wrapped around her instinctively, my heart dropping. To see Rosa in such turmoil\u2026 I held her tight against me, kneeling there on the arboretum path, stroking her hair as sobs wracked her body. \n\n\u201cI just need someone to love, An-on. I was so lonely, and scared, and\u2026\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice is lost as she buried her face deep within my chest. \n\n\u201cAnd you can love me, Rosa. We can love each other, together.\u201d Kissing her hair softly, I sat there as the sun dipped completely over the horizon, the light setting on our reunion. \n\n\u201cJust us, Rosa, together.\u201d"},"Garden Of Rosa Ending 4.txt":{"path":["Rosa","Garden Of Rosa Ending 4.txt"],"text":"Imagine if you would\u2026 \n\nActually, no. You don\u2019t need to imagine anything this time. This ending is about the Anon and Rosa you\u2019ve read about; about the tender but passionate love of two teenagers realizing their place in the world. The love of two people from different worlds, who, through plot contrivance or fate or whatever you wish to call it, managed to make it after all. Many of you may say it\u2019s foolish for people so young to experience something like this, that it would never last. And maybe it won\u2019t; maybe, in a year, or two, or ever ten, Anon and Rosa will realize they rushed into things, that they jumped into their relationship before checking to see how deep the waters truly ran. But what is important, is that they jumped. They took a risk on themselves and each other, and with hands held tightly together, they leapt into their future, comfortable that even if it didn\u2019t last, they still would have their memories.\n\nSo, remember this, dear reader: Sometimes it is better to jump into the shallows with a friend, than to swim in the depths alone.\n\n***\n\nThe day of the wedding has finally arrived. After a whirlwind of planning and preparation that occupied the last year of my life, it was finally time to seal my promise that I made to Rosa on that sparkling hilltop, the promise I made to her with her favorite flower. \n\nThe intervening months hadn\u2019t been easy, either. After graduation, I managed to land a summer job at Dino-Moe\u2019s, the kindly old T-Rex thankful for the help I had given to his favorite \u201cniece\u201d. Rosa likewise found summer employment, working at the arboretum as a part-time tour guide and activity coordinator. It became harder and harder for us to spend time together, and we cherished what few nights we could get alone together. Although Rosa still was adamant about the whole, \u201cno sex before marriage\u201d thing, she played fast and loose with the definition of sex for a supposedly devout Catholic girl. Every time I helped Rosa sneak home, stealing into her room at an hour that what Trish called \u201creal trigga\u2019 hours\u201d, I could swear that I heard a creak of floorboards coming from down the hall, where her parents slept. \n\nRosa\u2019s parents had been overjoyed to her of our engagement, throwing yet another large party for the extended family. They even invited my own parents, eager to welcome their future son-in-law\u2019s family into their own, to no avail. It seemed like my parents had nothing to do with me, their shameful \u201cdino-chaser\u201d son. Rosa\u2019s mom did not take this well, her progressing sickness having already confined her to a wheelchair most days, launching into an angry tirade of Spanish after the second week of no response. After that, she took it upon herself to mother me even more than she already had, inviting me over for dinner nearly every night until the wedding proper. Or maybe she was just trying to keep an eye on us.\n\nBut, back to the wedding. It seems the old adage was true: There really was nothing more useless than a groom on his wedding day. I wandered the halls of the old mission-style church that Rosa had picked out for us to the wedded in, my hands brushing the old stucco of the walls. Naser was with me, as was Reed, I having selected them both to be my best man for this, the happiest day of my life. Reed even had promised to stay sober for the occasion! Well, maybe just the ceremony. Naser had actually played a huge part in helping me plan, taking me out shopping for suits and ties and whatever else I was supposed to wear.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve said it before Anon, but congratulations dude, really.\u201d Naser clapped me on the shoulder, a huge grin splitting his face. \u201cI knew you and Rosa would make it!\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed Anon, I wish you and your new bride many happy returns.\u201d Sober Reed was taking some getting used to, for sure.\n\n\u201cThanks, both of you,\u201d I said, gripping each of their shoulders in response. An unspoken word passed between the three of us, a moment shared only between a groom and his best men. \u201cI know I don\u2019t say this enough, but I couldn\u2019t have done this without either of you.\u201d I had hoped the emphasis I placed on my words let them know I didn\u2019t just mean today. They seemed to understand, though; Naser quickly turning away, wiping what was of course dust from his eye, Reed grasping my hand in an iron grip of thanks. \n\n\u201cAnon?\u201d A voice from behind me caught my attention. Our wedding coordinator, a spinstery-looking plateosaur who knew some relative of Rosa\u2019s, stood at the doorway to the hall, clutching a clipboard to her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s time, you guys.\u201d Turning back to my two best men, we shared one final hug between us before heading towards the door, the coordinator holding me back for a quick private word.\n\n\u201cFeeling okay, Anon? No wedding jitters?\u201d The woman seemed convinced at times I would run out at the last minute, leaving Rosa standing at the altar. I fixed her with the most convincing smile I could manage, the one that could put even Rosa\u2019s mother at ease.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no place I would rather be.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood. Now you know how this is going to go: First up is Reed and Stella, followed by Naser and Fang. Then, you and-\u201c\n\n\u201cI know, I know: Then me and Rosa\u2019s mo\u2026 I mean, me and Lucretia.\u201d It still felt strange, calling her by her real name. She would always be Rosa\u2019s mom, to me. She had promised to accompany me down the aisle, my own mother having failed to show.\n\n\u201cJust making sure, just making sure.\u201d We could hear the music starting to rise, heralding the start of the ceremony. \u201cOkay, get in there Anon. And congratulations, to the both of you.\u201d Pulling me into a quick hug, she ushered me into the entrance of the hall, where Reed was already escorting Stella down the aisle. The rest of the party waiting in front of those open double-doors, through which I could see the guests on their feet. Fang gave me a quick smile, resplendent in her red bride\u2019s maid dress. I wonder what would\u2019ve happened between us, had I not been with Rosa\u2026\n\n\u201cHaving second thoughts, Anon?\u201d Rosa\u2019s mom \u2013 Lucretia \u2013 fixed me with her patented Mom glare, arching one finely sculpted eyebrow towards me. The wheelchair did little to dull that razor-sharp glare, and I quickly banished any thoughts of Fang and I together from my mind.\n\n\u201cNo, uh, Lucretia,\u201d I stammered, tripping over her real name. I took hold of her chair, pushing her towards the door as Naser and Fang started their walk towards the head of the church.\n\n\u201cAnon, about this name thing. I don\u2019t want you using that, okay?\u201d Her voice was quiet, pitched for only me ears. I could feel myself begin to sweat, long-silenced alarms beginning to ring in my head. Had I misjudged our relationship that bad? \u201cCall me Mom, instead.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but smile, wheeling Rosa\u2019s mom \u2013 my Mom \u2013 down the aisle. Leaning down, I whispered in her ear, a private word shared between adoptive mother and son. \u201cYou got it, Mom.\u201d\n\n[Anon\u2019s song: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-e16OHgss5E&ab_channel=AnthonyYoung]\n\nI can feel the eyes of every one of our guests boring into me as I reach the end of aisle at last. Leaning down, I hug Mom with everything I\u2019ve got, hoping that this simple embrace conveys the magnitude of my thanks. Thanks not just for tonight, or for accepting me fully into their family; but for everything she\u2019s done for me and Rosa over the months. Lucretia hugs me back, and as one of Rosa\u2019s brothers wheels her to the place of honor at the head of aisle, I can see her already dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief. \n\nFlashing my four friends \u2013 Fang, Stella, Reed, and Naser \u2013 a huge smile, I take my place in front of the priest, a doddering old ankylosaur who looks to be one foot in the grave already. This was another means by which Rosa and I could afford such a luxurious wedding: By using as many family members of Rosa\u2019s as possible. I guess this old fossil was a distant uncle or something, flown in special just for this occasion. Truth be told, I was a little apprehensive about a Catholic ceremony in the first place, but Rosa insisted we do things properly.\n\nBut none of that matters now, as the music begins to swell once more. The entire hall knows what this means, the guests getting to their feet and facing the entrance in giddy anticipation. I can\u2019t help but smile along with them, knowing that any second, I\u2019ll get my first glimpse of\u2026\n\nOh.\n\nOh wow.\n\nShe\u2019s\u2026!\n\nSlowly gliding gracefully down the aisle, Rosa is a simply the most beautiful thing in the world. Her dress is a gorgeous strapless satin gown, the glossy silk molding to every curve of her body. White stiletto heels peak out from beneath her dress, the hem of which is bedecked in delicate embroidered wildflowers, the very same ones which Rosa loves so much. A magnificent crown of roses sits on Rosa\u2019s head, her brilliant auburn hair cascading down one shoulder in a waterfall of thick curls. Even without the dress, Rosa herself was resplendent, crimson eyes twinkling at me over a smile big enough for the entire world. I hardly noticed her dad next to her until he kissed her on her cheek, tears unabashedly running down his face as he took his seat next to his wife. \n\nRosa took her place opposite of me on the dais, handing Stella her multi-colored bouquet of roses. As she turned, my already boggling eyes threatened to pop out of my head: Rosa\u2019s entire dress was backless, the material only just surrounding her tail. Dear god, whoever made this fantastic feat of haute couture, thank you\u2026\n\nA sharp \u201cahem\u201d from the priest sent a ripple of giggles through the assembled wedding party, Fang catching her face-palm at the last second. I could feel my face grow flushed as I realized just what they were laughing at.\n\n\u201cMumbling again, mi amor?\u201d Rosa whispered, her eyes flashing with mirth as she gives my hands a squeeze. \n\nI\u2019ve really got to get a handle on that.\n\nThe surprising strong voice of the priest quieted the last remains of our laughter, signaling the start of the ceremony proper. \u201cIf we may begin\u2026\u201d\n\n***\n\nAfter what felt like hours, Rosa and I were finally released, sprinting down the aisle in a hail of rice and flower petals before being whisked away to our newlywed duties. Seems a Catholic ceremony really does take as long as you would expect. Neither of us could help but grin, however, our sore feet and hunger stomachs ultimately proving insignificant against our overwhelming happiness. As we posed for picture after picture out on the church lawn, Rosa and I couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter every few minutes, faces sore from smiling.\n\n\u201cOh, mi amor, that was so wonderful!\u201d Rosa chattered excitedly, leaning her head on my shoulder and placing her hand on my chest for the next round of pictures. Faint music from the church\u2019s reception hall filtered over to us, Reed having taken on dee-jay duties for the wedding as well. I made him promise to limit the number of VVURM DRAMA tracks; this was a wedding, not some pizza-parlor. \u201cAnd you vows, they were so sweet! An-on, I never knew you could be so thoughtful.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, I had some help,\u201d I replied through the side of my mouth, keeping my smile frozen for the camera. \u201cOkay, a lot of help. Stella basically wrote most of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, so that\u2019s why I was \u2018super-kawaii\u2019, hmm?\u201d Shit, I was hoping she would\u2019ve missed that part. Chuckling, Rosa placed her lips near my ear, within easy distance of a cheek-kiss, should the photographer request it. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to make that one up to me, An-on\u2026\u201d I just barely managed to resist yelping as Rosa squeezed my ass, her other hand hidden from the photographer\u2019s lens. Seizing her \u201cAnd remember, we\u2019re esposo y esposa, now; no more playing around in the bedroom.\u201d Oh man. I could barely manage to keep my head through the rest of the pictures, Rosa taking delight in teasing me when no one was looking. The torture didn\u2019t end with the photographer, either: Rosa was insatiable throughout dinner as well, her hand creeping up my thigh underneath the table, until\u2026 Well-wishers and guests all around us, I could only smile and grit me teeth, thankful that the tablecloths hid what was going on. \n\nDancing, at least, provided a reprieve from Rosa\u2019s amorous advancements. With all eyes on us as we took to the dance floor, Rosa mercifully kept her hands above my waistline as we rotated to Rosa\u2019s chosen song, a sad acoustic rendition of her favorite Latin ballad. It felt nice, having Rosa on my shoulder as we swayed to the music; what felt even better was the knowledge that we were making this song our    own, permanently forging a new bond between us. But isn\u2019t that what marriage was for? \n\nExcept for sitting out the traditional mother-son dance, I managed to stay out on the dance floor the whole night, doing my best not to embarrass my new wife as Reed started into more upbeat pop numbers. To his credit, Reed put on a good show: The more experimental tracks he had chosen blended well, satisfying even Fang as she bounced along to the tempo. In the final slow song, played just before most of the older guests had gone home, I actually found myself dancing with Fang, Rosa having taken this opportunity to dance with her aged grandfather. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for you, dweeb,\u201d Fang said, her hands knotted behind my neck. \u201cYou and Rosa really do belong together.\u201d\n\nGrinning, I glanced over to where Rosa was rotating slowly with a wrinkled old ankylosaur in an outdated suit, manly tears flowing down the older gentlemen\u2019s face. \u201cThanks Fang. That means a lot, coming from you. I\u2019m serious!\u201d I added, as Fang snorted and rolled her eyes. \u201cAfter all we\u2019ve been through, how could your opinion not matter?\u201d\n\nFang\u2019s face reddened as she glanced shyly up at me. \u201cSo what are you and Rosa going to do? Are you, like, going to college together, or\u2026\u201d Fang\u2019s voice trailed off, her question hanging in the air between us. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, really.\u201d Studying the celling of the dance floor, I contemplated where my life with Rosa would take me. \u201cRosa\u2019s got this program she wants to attend, about plants or something. Maybe I\u2019ll follow her there.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Fang pulled me into a hug, her soft wings suddenly encompassing us both in a soft blanket. It was so intimate, the two of us sealed off from the rest of the world behind a curtain of grey feathers. \u201cWhatever you decided to do, promise you won\u2019t forget about me, Anon. Okay?\u201d\n\nMoving my hands off her waist, I hug Fang back, feeling something wet against my cheek. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget you, Fang. I promise.\u201d\n\n***\n\n-Nine Months later-\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, Rosa, just push! Push! A little more!\u201d \n\nThe harsh lights of our hospital room highlighted the sweat beading on Rosa\u2019s forehead. Her once luxurious hair lay damp with sweat, splattered across her face as if from a careless painter\u2019s brush. Screwing her face up for another push, Rosa squeezed my hand, the other one clasped around the bed\u2019s railing. Nurses in mint-green scrubs crowded around us, each monitoring a different part of Rosa\u2019s vitals. At the foot of the bed, partially obscured by the sheets, the doctor guided her through her breathing, providing her own words of encouragement. \n\n\u201c\u00a1\u00bfAyyyy, An-on, cu\u00e1nto m\u00e1s de esto !? Rosa\u2019s voice was tight through gritted teeth, panting as she ran through her breathing exercises. Although the immeasurable about of pain Rosa was in twisted her mouth in a scowl, she never once squeezed my hand with more pressure than I could bear.\n\n\u201cJust a little more babe, that\u2019s it! Push!\u201d Screaming, Rosa gave it one more push, the excited chatter of the doctor egging her on. \n\nFinally, amid Rosa\u2019s screams and the beeping and whirling of various hospital monitoring equipment, there rose a new noise, small at first but growing with intensity with each second. Normally, this sound would agonize or annoy most people, but to Rosa and me, it was the most wonderful sound in the world, a representation of our love: The shrill, tiny cry of our newborn daughter. \n\nQuickly wiping her down and wrapping her up, the doctor handed Rosa our bundle of joy. Letting go of my hand at last, Rosa cradled our daughter in her arms, weeping happily between attempts to soothe our chubby little baby. At that moment, despite looking like she had just dunked her head in a bucket of her own sweat, Rosa was at her most beautiful, her face illuminated with the unmistakable love of a mother. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her name, you two?\u201d The voice of a nurse, pen poised over her paperwork, caught my attention. Rosa was too enamored to respond, but I knew what she wanted, what we both wanted.\n\n\u201cHer name is Camellia Lucretia Meltrozo Mous,\u201d I said, beaming with the pride of a new father.\n\nRosa\u2019s voice was weak, a soft whisper that only I and our new daughter could hear. \u201cAnd your grandmother would\u2019ve loved you very, very much.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe kitchen window of our new house gives me a spectacular view of the sunrise as I linger before it. My mug, filled to the brim with the life-affirming nectar that is coffee, bears upon its surface the two tiny footprints of an infant. A similar mug sits on the shelf above me, never to be used, the tiny painted feet belonging to my wife. Next to that mug sits a framed picture of our familia: Rosa, Camellia and I at the gazebo, commemorating our daughter\u2019s first birthday with cake and balloons in her mother\u2019s favorite spot.\n\n\u201cSo, An-on, how do I look?\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice turns me away from the view. Her usual clothes have been replaced with a white blouse and black pencil skirt, a student ID badge clipped to her waist. I can see she\u2019s nervous about her new look, used to a more comfortable outfit that was at home in the garden. She twirls her hair nervously around one finger, only enhancing how attractive she is to me.\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Sipping my coffee gives me an excuse to study her outfit more, and I can\u2019t help but smile at how well she wears it. The skirt is relatively conservative, reaching down to her knees, but damn if it doesn\u2019t hug her hips well. Loosen the top few buttons on that blouse, and she\u2019d be the very model of a modern married mistress.  \u201cLooks good Rosa, but isn\u2019t it a little fancy for your first day of school?\u201d \n\n\u201cNot just school, An-on!\u201d Rosa plants her fists on her hips, that all-too familiar bossy look crinkling her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s college! The most important part of my life, and I do no want to look bad!\u201d \n\n\u201cI know babe, I\u2019m just teasing.\u201d I still loved how easy I could get her goat, all these years later. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you going to be learning about habitat conservation and plants and shit? Are the heels really necessary?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just classwork for now, An-on. Fieldwork isn\u2019t for a few more weeks.\u201d Rosa flips a small compact mirror open, checking her hair one last time before throwing it back into her purse. I hand her a travel coffee mug, the liquid still steaming out of the top. As she opens the lid to blow on the near-boiling brew within, she gives me a half-smile, lowering her eyes knowingly. \u201cBesides, if you\u2019re good, maybe I wear these heels tonight, si?\u201d \n\nSputtering, I choke on my own coffee. Rosa unsuccessfully suppresses a fit of laughter, giggling behind her hands as she tests the temperature of her mug. As I attempt to soothe my scalded airwaves, Rosa glances towards the only other picture in our kitchen, a metal-framed photo hung proudly on the wall by the entrance. It\u2019s a great shot of her mother, sitting and laughing in Rosa\u2019s childhood kitchen, surrounded by her friends and family. It was a wedding gift from Mom, a promise that she would always be a part of our lives, even after she passed. \n\n\u201cDo you think she would be proud of me, An-on?\u201d Rosa\u2019s face is serene, but I can see the sadness in her eyes. Her father promised the family farm was in good hands, but leaving home still nagged at Rosa. She was always a family girl at heart, and moving out of her childhood home had been hard for her.\n\nCoughing lightly, I bundle up Rosa from behind in a hug, wrapping my arms around her stomach and kissing her neck. \u201cRosa, I know she would be proud of you. Hell, even a year out of high-school, they still offered you a full scholarship!\u201d Rosa relaxes her body against mine, twisting her head so we could share a brief kiss. \u201cAnyways, we both know the only reason I got in was due to need. You\u2019re the brains in this family, mi amor.\u201d \n\nRosa rolls her eyes, smiling as she moves to gather her keys from the kitchen counter. Packing them into her purse, she spins towards me, wagging a finger exaggeratedly \u201cAn-on, do no say such things! You know what I said about joking about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? No sex for a week?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u00a1Si! And I mean it this time!\u201d I can tell by the way she\u2019s blushing that there was no way she meant it. She was an animal in the bedroom, as insatiable as the day we were married. Hell, she was already talking about having another kid! Grinning over the lip of my mug, I waggle my eyebrows furiously at her, eliciting another giggle. \n\nYep, no way she meant it.\n\nAlmost as if on cue, a shrill cry echoes from Camellia\u2019s room. Finishing up my coffee, I wave Rosa aside, already heading down the hall. The pastel-pink nursery was covered in hand-painted murals, Rosa\u2019s neat and scientifically accurate flowers rubbing side-by-side with my garish cartoon animals. Camellia was already settling down, the little peach-colored dino tike burbling happily at the sight of me. I couldn\u2019t help but smile as I gather my daughter in my arms, bouncing her up and down as we rejoined Rosa in the entry way. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get her to Papa today, si?\u201d Rosa was checking and re-checking the contents of her purse, no doubt nervous for her first day. Her voice started to increase in speed, too. \u201cThere\u2019s some leftover chilies rellenos in the fridge as well. Remember, you\u2019ve got to drop her off before her nap this afternoon, An-on. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to-\u201d\n\n\u201cI know Rosa.\u201d Turning to Camellia, I pretend-nibble her horns, a surefire way to make her laugh. \u201cCammy, can you say, \u2018Momma worries too much?\u2019\u201d Rosa\u2019s eyes light up, the sight of the two of us soothing her mood. Rosa could never stay anxious when Cammy laughed like that. As I bring our daughter over, Rosa peppers her with kisses, causing the laughter to reach super-sonic levels. \u201cSeriously Rosa, your family\u2019s got this.  And you\u2019re gonna\u2019 do great today.\u201d Holding Rosa by the cheek, I give her a deep kiss, the same way I have done ever since we got together. \u201cI know it.\u201d \n\nRosa takes my hand in hers, snuggling against it tenderly. Her crimson eyes stared at us lovingly, full of affection and admiration only a mother and a wife could give. Smiling back at her, I wonder just how often I found myself starting into those beautiful eyes, watching her slowly fall asleep in the bed or napping on the couch with Camellia on her chest. How many times did I make sure my smile was the last thing she saw before she fell asleep?\n\n\u201cOh! Before you go, Rosa\u2026\u201d Withdrawing my hand from Rosa\u2019s cheek, I fish awkwardly in my pocket, careful not to disturb Camellia. Finally, I manage to extract what I was looking for: A small hinged wooden box that sits comfortably in the palm of my hand. \u201cI think you need one more thing to complete your outfit.\u201d It takes some finesse, but I manage to flip the lid of the box open and hold it with the same hand, revealing a small diamond ring nestled inside. \u201cWhen you said yes to me, that night on the hill, I couldn\u2019t afford a real ring. But now that we\u2019ve got some money, I figured\u2026\u201d My voice faltered when I caught Rosa\u2019s expression: She was covering her mouth, thick tears welling in her eyes. Damnit, now you\u2019re gonna make me cry! \n\nFanning herself in a feeble attempt to keep the tears at bay, Rosa held out a trembling hand, her ring finger separated. I let my own tears fall as they would, bending awkwardly to hold the box and my daughter in one hand as I slipped the ring on with the other. It fits Rosa perfectly, thanks to my secret attempts to gage her ring size with a bit of old string. For a heartbeat, I hold Rosa by the hand before releasing, letting her admire the ring on her finger. Shoot, wasn\u2019t I supposed to kneel down, or something?\n\n\u201cOh An-on, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Rosa murmurs, examining the ring. Laughing, Rosa leans over to fish a tissue out of her purse, laughing as she dabs at her eyes. \u201cAy, An-on! You made me ruin my make-up!\u201d \n\n\u201cI guess I get you for a little while longer then,\u201d I said, dabbing a few of my own tears away. Camellia merely glances between us, unable to figure why her parents were getting so weepy, and no doubt wondering if she should start crying too. Smiling, Rosa plants a kiss on my forehead, the added height of her heels making it easy to do so. \n\n\u201cOh, mi amado esposo\u2026 You always will.\u201d \n\n***\n\nThe evening sun is roasting as Rosa and I make our way towards our old school, making us both the formal wear we donned for tonight. A line of former students already trails out of the entrance, the twenty-something chatting excitedly as we joined the back of the line.\n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s been so long!\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly five years bro, that\u2019s, like, nothing!\u201d\n\nRosa gives my hand a squeeze as I attempt to press myself into what little shade I can find. I never did like the summer heat of this place, and with this jacket on, I feel like I\u2019m about to melt at any moment. \n\n\u201cAww, poor An-on! I told you you would be too hot in this sun.\u201d I can\u2019t decide if Rosa\u2019s tone is mocking or sympathizing as I mop my brow with the back of one hand. She herself looks perfectly cool in her two-tone black and red dress, a small bloom of her favorite flower tucked behind her ear.  \u201cThe line is moving so we will no have to wait long, at least.\u201d The assembled mass of former classmates is indeed shuffling along quickly, each of them no doubt eager to get the night started.\n\n\u201cYooo, is that you guys? Hey, Anon, Rosa!\u201d We both immediate recognize that voice, the drugged-out drawl unmistakable. A pink raptor in comically oversized shades trots up to us, seemingly unaware of the heat despite his thick woolen hoodie. \u201cBroooooo, it\u2019s been too long!\u201d \n\n\u201cHey, Reed, what\u2019s going on?\n\n\u201c\u00a1Hola Reed! Dios M\u00edo Reed, what happened?!\u201d Rosa\u2019s mouth was agape as she took in our old friend. Reed\u2019s clothes were tattered and worn, riddled with holes and wrinkled as if Reed had slept in them every day since graduation. Even his barred sunglasses were worse for wear, several of the bars having noticeable cracks. \n\n\u201cWhat? Oh, you\u2019re checking out muh\u2019 digs, man!\u201d Reed shoots us his most winning smile, tossing two thumbs up. \u201cIt\u2019s all the style over at Silica Valley, man.\u201d \n\n\u201cWait, Silica Valley?\u201d I interject, just now noticing the expensive watch on Reed\u2019s wrist, how those torn jeans were a brand I knew I could never afford. \u201cYou live there? How\u2019d you afford that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBro, I\u2019m like, the richest raptor in the world! CEO of my own start-up, been getting heavily into the snootcoin market too. It all started with\u2026\u201d Reed proceeds to regale us with a bunch of tech-gibberish, too specific even for my own understand. All that I gather is that despite his ramshackle appearance, Reed is loaded. \u201c\u2026And then they made me their king, dude.\u201d Rosa and I nod, sharing a bemused look between us. \u201cSo, what have the two of you been up to?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, not much, man. Rosa got her degree in Environmental Science over at Volcaldera State, me in Business-\u201c\n\nRosa interjects, beaming with pride as she rubs my shoulder. \u201cMi marido is very smart, Reed. Maybe you two should go into business together!\u201d \n\n\u201cBro, that would be, like, fuckin\u2019 sweet! Let\u2019s talk numbers sometimes, I\u2019ll have my guy call your guy and us guys can-\u201c I hold up my hand, knowing I need to stop this train before it gets going.\n\n\u201cSounds great Reed, but can we talk inside? I\u2019m dying out here, man.\u201d\n\nWe quickly move along to the gymnasium, catching back up with the line. The sight of our old prom venue brings me back, a wash of happy memories flooding my brain. It all looks so strange; the familiar walls covered in different school posters, updated sports rosters. In a lot of ways, the old school hasn\u2019t changed a bit.\n\n\u201cThis really takes you back, huh bro?\u201d Reed clapped me on the back, gesturing to the sign-in table. \u201cLet\u2019s get penciled in; can\u2019t get drinks without it!\u201d Spurred on by the prospect of talking to old high-school classmates without alcohol, we practically stampede towards the table, a familiar sight waiting for us there like a salmon Stepford wife.\n\n\u201cOh! Hi Anon, Hi Rosa! So glad you could make it!\u201d Naomi\u2019s voice hasn\u2019t quite lost its saccharine edge, but the years have dulled it slightly. The former tangerine torturer sported a decided \u201cMom\u201d look, her light-purple sweater matching with her blue top and comfortable jeans. Frowning, she fixes Reed with a frosty glare, sniffing as Reed signs in as \u2018Sir-Dicks-a-Lot\u2019. \u201cReed. Nice to see you haven\u2019t changed one bit.\u201d\n\nReed shoots Naomi a finger-gun, slapping his name-tag upside-down on her chest with the other hand. \u201cNope!\u201d Waving to Rosa and I, Reed slipped off towards where the bar has been set up, leaving the three of us to chat. \n\n\u201cSo, Naomi, how are you? Did you and Naser ever\u2026?\u201d Rosa gives Naomi a mischievous smile, her innuendo spoiled somewhat by the hand gesture Rosa flashes. Naomi\u2019s face falls, her sad eyes falling to the floor.\n\n\u201cActually, Naser and I aren\u2019t together anymore.\u201d Rosa lays an apologetic hand on Naomi\u2019s shoulder, murmuring a quiet apology.\n\n\u201cWhat happened? If it\u2019s not too much to say.\u201d I add quickly under Rosa\u2019s withering glare. \n\n\u201cOh, we grew apart in college, and by the time he graduated it just wasn\u2019t there anymore. I think he\u2019s with someone named Olivia, now.\u201d Naomi manages to pull her eyes from her shoes at last, attempting to wear a decidedly fixed smile. \u201cBut, it\u2019s for the best! I\u2019m actually seeing someone else, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, see Naomi? It do no always work out the way you expect, but it always works out, si?\u201d Wait, why did Rosa look at ME when she said that? \n\nNaomi\u2019s smile grew a little warmer, her momentary spell of melancholy already a thing of the past. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Rosa! Just look at you and Anon, how happy you are! You two enjoy the party tonight, and thanks!\u201d Rosa ushered me quickly away from the table, steering me towards where Reed was attempting to convince the bartender to mix every type of alcohol together at once.\n\n\u201cWhat did she mean, \u2018look at you and Anon\u2019? Rosa?\u201d My wife just smiled at me, shaking her head as she took my hand. \n\n\u201cOh An-on, what Naomi did in the past is in the past, si? Come on, let\u2019s enjoy the party!\u201d Planting me squarely next to Reed, Rosa orders us all drinks, the bartender nodding along to her rapid Spanish. Reed immediately begins talking my ear off again, laying out his latest business venture and imploring me to get in on the ground floor. Desperate for anything to talk about besides work, I spot a small purple figure making her way through the crowd, waving my one-time doxxer over.\n\n\u201cTrish! Hey, over here! Man, it\u2019s good to see you again!\u201d Trish and I embrace as she joins us at the bar, our personal axe long buried. Trish is looking decidedly business-like in a sharp black skirt and blazer, her professional look marred only somewhat by the numerous engravings and piercings her horns have acquired over the years. \n\n\u201cAnon, it\u2019s good to see you again. And you Rosa!\u201d The two women share a hug, and I can\u2019t help but notice how much Rosa has Trish beat in the, ahem, chest area now. I thank Raptor Jesus once more for the effects of Rosa\u2019s pregnancy, being VERY careful not to mumble.  \u201cMan, if I look that good after pumpin\u2019 out a kid, I\u2019ll be the luckiest woman in the world.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you Trish! Si, being a mother has made me so happy, I would no trade it for anything.\u201d Trish takes a seat on the other side of Rosa, flagging the bartender down.\n\nI lean in to whisper in Rosa\u2019s ear, careful to keep my face neutral. \u201cI don\u2019t think she meant it that way, babe.\u201d  \n\n\u201cOh? What does she mean, An-on? Trish, what is he talking about?\u201d Trish only shakes her head, the two of us sharing a smile at Rosa\u2019s behalf. The four of us quickly get to catching up, swapping stories of our lives since graduating Volcano High, and before long it\u2019s like we\u2019re back in high-school once more. The only person missing is\u2026\n\n\u201cLucy!\u201d Rosa, Reed, and Trish shout, downing out my intonation of \u2018Fang!\u2019. We all raise a glass as the final member of our teenage troupe finally joins us, sharing a three-way hug with Rosa and Trish as Reed and I get up to join them. \n\n\u201cUgh, Anon, I told you to stop calling me that!\u201d Fang rolls her eyes, sharing a brief hug with me before Reed catapults into her. Fang\u2019s adapted to her new role as music teacher well, her brown turtle-neck and slacks a far-cry from the rebellious teenage rocker I once knew. \u201cOkay, Reed, yep, I see you there, thanks.\u201d Reed finally let Fang go, stumbling back to his stool before ordering another round. Good lore, how much has he had?\n\n\u201cNah, you\u2019ll always be Fang to me. You wanna\u2019 stay with us for a drink, Fang?\u201d I ask, placing special emphasis on her one-time name. Fang groans once more, smiling even as she covers her eyes behind her hand. Rosa scoots a little closer to me, sipping on her drink as our hands find each other by our sides.\n\n\u201cMaybe just one, I\u2019ve got to keep this thing running and everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds rough. How\u2019d they saddle you with that job, anyways?\u201d Trish asks, chasing her straw around the lip of her glass.\n\n\u201cSi, weren\u2019t you the new music teacher?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still a teaching assistant,\u201d Fang clarifies, graciously accepting a proffered drink from the bartender. \u201cMr. Jingo should be close to retiring, so after that, I\u2019ll be the music teacher. Until then I\u2019m stuck doing everything no one else wants to do, like overseeing a bunch of drunk former students.\u201d Sipping her drink, Fang rolls her eyes at Reed, where the perhaps-CEO is rapidly becoming too drunk to order anything more. \u201cSpeaking of\u2026\u201d Fang excuses herself from the group, leaving her half-finished drink on a table before taking the stage to give the closing speech, tapping the microphone to get everyone\u2019s attention. \n\n\u201cAlright everyone, thank you for coming tonight. I\u2019m sure everyone had a good time\u2026\u201d Reed interrupts at this moment with a loud drunken hurrah, spilling what\u2019s left of his last call, causing Fang to roll her eyes once more. \u201c\u2026But, unfortunately, tonight can\u2019t last forever. Please start finding your DD\u2019s or taking one of the taxis that we have on-call for you. Thank you.\u201d Fang replaces the mic on the stand before jumping off, shuffling through the thinning crowd back to us. Meanwhile, Trish has managed to get Reed into an upright position, half-dragging him off his barstool and to his feet.\n\n\u201cAlright, it\u2019s been fun but I better this asshole home before he hurts himself.\u201d Trish begins escorting the near-comatose raptor to the door, following the mass of other students. \u201cWe should do this again, though! Hanging out, I mean, not getting drunk off our asses.\u201d Glancing over her shoulder, Trish gives one final wave, leaving Rosa, Fang and I alone at the bar. \n\n\u201cI do no understand how Reed managed to start his own company, when he acts like that!\u201d Rosa sipped the last of her drink, shaking her head sadly in Reed and Trish\u2019s direction. \n\n\u201cI guess some things never change, huh?\u201d Fang expertly vaults over the now-unsupervised bar, clearing out what\u2019s left in the mini-fridge. \u201cAnyways, I\u2019ve got to start clearing this place up. You two are welcome to stay, if you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes clearing up entail taking all the leftover alcohol home?\u201d I grin over my drink, Fang flashing me the finger as she stuffs mini-bottles of liquor into a plastic bag. \u201cHey, just leave us some and your secret is safe with us.\u201d\n\nRosa glances up at me, fluttering her eyelashes pleadingly. \u201cAn-on, how about we go see the gardens? For old times\u2019 sake?\u201d Damnit, she knows I can\u2019t resist her when she puts on those puppy-dog eyes. \n\n\u201cGood idea Rosa! The students have made a few changes since you left, but the gardens are still in good hands.\u201d \n\n\u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9? Lucy has an interest in gardening?\u201d Fang\u2019s reddening face reveals Rosa hit the nail on the head. Joyfully, Rosa claps her hands together, her face beaming with delight. \u201cOooh, this is so exciting! Lucy, you have to come over sometime! I can teach you all about soil retention and crop rotation and-\u201c\n\nFang throws up her fingers in a make-shift crucifix, recoiling. \u201cAnon. Please. Save me!\u201d \n\n\u201cAlright Rosa, leave the poor girl alone. Here, let\u2019s see the gardens!\u201d\n\n\u201cAww, but I was just-\u201c\n\n\u201cI know, babe, I know. Maybe this weekend?\u201d I raise a questioning eyebrow back towards Fang, who nods in assent. Waving, we leave Fang alone to \u201cclean\u201d out the bar, pushing open a side door and stepping into the night. The moonlight coupled with the lamps on the side of the school gives enough light for us to navigate our way around back, to the school\u2019s familiar gardens, Rosa slipping her arms around mine as we walk.  \n\nSighing, Rosa leans her head against my shoulder. \u201cAhh, what a lovely evening\u2026 So nice to see everyone, wasn\u2019t it An-on?\u201d I nod, leaning my own head against Rosa\u2019s. And getting a sharp poke in return. Ow. \u201cMi amor, how many times do I have to say it?\u201d I can just barely see Rosa\u2019s smirk in the twilight. I never can remember the horns.\n\n\u201cS\u2019not fair, you have a natural defense against cuddling.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat has no stopped you before, hmmm?\u201d Rosa gives a little shiver, the heat of the day rapidly diminishing now that the sun has gone down. I lend her my jacket, wrapping my arms around her for extra warmth. It\u2019s nice, walking these paths with Rosa once more. It brings back memories of those awkward times in high-school, of us holding hands in the halls as we walked to class. Before long, we reach the gardens, the recognizable shapes of well-trimmed bushes and flower beds still visible in the darkness. We stroll along, glancing at the new growths set down by this year\u2019s freshman class, the neat orderly rows of bulbs not fit to bloom for several more years. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awfully quiet, An-on. Something wrong?\n\n\u201cHmm? Oh, nothing. Just remember the good ol\u2019 days.\u201d I squeeze Rosa tightly, feeling her press against me, sighing happily. \u201cDo you remember this spot, maybe a few weeks after I moved here? You almost kissed me, right there.\u201d I point to a spot in the gardens where Rosa and I had our first near-kiss experience, grinning at the flood of happy memories.\n\n\u201c\u00bfDisculpe? I think it was you who almost kissed me, An-on.\u201d Rosa begins stroking my arm around her waist, and I can feel her tail swinging happily between my legs. \u201cOooh, I was so nervous. Here was this cute new chico in school, and you were so concerned about me and my flowers. Such a gentlemen!\u201d Rosa hooked her tail around my leg, something she only did when she was truly, blissfully happy. \u201cI wanted you to kiss me, though. I wanted it so badly, but you were too cute and awkward to do it!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d I turn Rosa around in my arms until we\u2019re standing face to face, a blossoming of pink spread across her face. It was so cute how she still blushed when she looked at me\u2026 \u201cWell, I\u2019m not so awkward anymore.\u201d My hand cups her cheek gently, Rosa\u2019s hand stroking my own. Rosa is already leaning into me, her eyes closing gently. \u201cLet me give you that kiss you\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d Our lips meet as we embrace, just like we always did before when we were teens. \n\nGoodbye, Volcano High.\n\nAnd thank you."},"The Garden Party.txt":{"path":["Rosa","The Garden Party.txt"],"text":"Title: The Garden Party\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Fang, Trish, Reed, Stella, Rosa, Naser, Naomi and Anon\nRating: Semi-NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Rangto\nSummary: It's close to the end of the year, And Rosa decides she's going to toss her friends a Garden Party at her house. Everything goes without a hitch until they eat some of Reed's 'special' guacamole. Hilarity ensues.\n\n\nA gift for a good artists friend of mine who helped me in a great time of need. Based this story on his hilarious image. Hope you like what I wrote, heh.\n\n\nThe end of the school year fast approaches, and with it, the end of an age for all involved. Life will take its course after graduation, and everyone will go their separate ways. From college, to the workforce, to places beyond Volcaldera, the future can't be more uncertain, but at the same time, can't be brighter.\n\nRosa knows well what was to come next. Even so, it doesn't make accepting it any easier for the pious ankylosaur. \n\nOver the last few months, she has grown closer to some of her classmates. Each of her friends is unique in their own way. The different races and backgrounds were expected. Still, each of them brought something new to her life that, if she was honest, made her appreciate how fortunate she was to have such good fellows. So, to celebrate their friendship, Rosa called up all her friends and invited them to a garden party at her house. \n\nRosa's house is a few minutes outside of town. Though calling it a 'house' was an understatement. The truth is that the abode is closer to a hacienda or a rancho. It is also on the older side, built by the earliest members of Rosa's dynasty, who had lived in the area since before the days of the old west. The land covered by the house alone was half a square mile. It allowed for lots of open grass fields and a small patch of farmland that Rosa's family tended to. As a result, it gave the orange dino plenty of space to work with.\n\n\u201cIt will be one week from today,\u201d Rosa tells her friends, who are all listening in to a group call with her. \u201cWe\u2019ll have musica and food and everything to make the party something that we will all remember for a\u00f1os to come!\u201d\n\nThere is not one single complaint. Everyone is more than excited at the prospect of a weekend party at Rosa\u2019s.\n\nFor the next week, Rosa spends all her time not already taken up by school or her duties as the president of the gardening club preparing for the weekend party. She bought all the party supplies she\u2019d need on Monday. She made a list of all the ingredients she\u2019d need to cook the many dishes she'd be prepping on Tuesdays. She asked and sourced the tables and chairs she\u2019d use for the party from her family on Wednesday. She went out shopping with Stella and bought all the ingredients and confectionaries on Thursday. Finally, she got down to the cooking on Friday night. When Saturday morning rolls around, all she needs to do is set the tables and chairs, roll out two large speakers, and bring out the food. It takes her about two hours to set everything up. She thinks back to her family offering to help, but she instead convinced them to take the day away to enjoy their own picnic. As a result, Rosa had the house all to herself, which also means she had the entirety of the fields to herself as well.\n\nRosa walks around, looking over her preparation. The tables are all decorated with colorful mantles. The silverware she sourced for the party is sterling and shining. The speakers are plugged and ready to blast out tunes all day long. Finally, the food rest on chafing dishes, the disposable burners are set alight, keep the food nice and warm for the day to come.\n\nRosa Can't help but feel an almost overwhelming sense of accomplishment at her work. She might be a gardener at heart, but she can be a great caterer if she wants to. \u201c\u00a1Este es mi mejor trabajo hasta ahora!\u201d Rosa tells herself as she puts on a broad, ear-to-ear smile.\n\nNothing can go wrong now. \n\nRosa\u2019s phone rings. She looks down at the name on the ID and picks up after only a single ring. \n\n\u201c\u00a1Hola!\u201d Rosa exclaims jubilantly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d the overly ecstatic voice of Stella, Rosa\u2019s oldest friend, replies from the other side of the line with barely restrained enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cBe there in un segundo!\u201d Rosa responds, ending the call and heading to her house with a skip to her step. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for the ankylosaur to enter her home, pass into the living room, and reach the foyer. With one final check of her outfit\u2014her usual floral print black dress for familiarity and comfort\u2014she reaches for her door handle and opens the door. \n\nThe moment the door swings, Rosa's greeted by a group of assorted dinos and one human, all of them her friends. Everyone is present: Anon, Fang, Stella, Reed, Trish, Naser, and Naomi.\n\n\u201cAmigos!\u201d Rosa joyously exclaims, all the while opening up her arms in greeting. \u201cCome in, come in!\u201d she says, stepping to the side courteously.\n\nOne by one, Rosa's friends filter into the house. Each carries a piece of food or a bottle of drink with them to enjoy in their hands. \n\nAnon and Fang carry with them some assorted bags of chips and at least five bottles of soda. Stella carries with her what looks like a medium cake decorated with white frosting and pink flourishes, forming a small five-pronged star. Trish has several boxes of assorted chocolates in her hand, as well as at least one bag of bonbons. Reed carries with him a large bowl of what looks like guacamole. Finally, Naser and Naomi hold on to covered bowls in their hands. Naser\u2019s bowl contains what looks like homemade flan, and Naomi\u2019s what looks to be some kind of rice pudding.\n\nRosa looks at all the dishes her friends brought with them and laughs. \u201cOh, you chicos didn\u2019t have to bring so much food!\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d Stella replies with a wide simper on her lips. \u201cThe more food we have, the merrier we\u2019ll all be!\u201d\n\nThe rest of Rosa's friends nod in agreement with Stella. The excitement of such an enormous feast gets everyone's mouth salivating.\n\nRosa doesn\u2019t argue with Stella\u2019s comment. In all honestly, she\u2019s also excited about being able to let loose on all the delicious food. It isn't every day she gets to feast like royalty. If there's any time for it, it is during a garden party right before graduation rolls around.\n\nReed walks up to Rosa, his usual laidback smile twice as large that day. \u201cHey, dude. Can I like, put this in your fridge for right now?\u201d Reed pointed to the bowl of guacamole in his hands. \u201cWanna save it for later today if that\u2019s cool with you.\u201d\n\n\"Of course!\" Rosa exclaims, more than happy to do as Reed asks. She grabs the bowl and motions for everyone to follow her. She again passes by the living room and kitchen, only now with a group in tow.\n\n\"The garden's that way,\" Rosa points as she leaves the group and makes a detour towards the fridge. Everyone else makes their way outside while the ankylosaur stuffs Reed's bowl of avocado-based dip into her fridge. As she does, she noticed Reed giving her a thumb\u2019s up and a broad smile before turning to walk out of the house as well.\n\nRosa didn't make much of her friend's gesture. She was happy she could help him in some way.\n\nMeanwhile, Fang, Anon, Trish, Naser, Naomi, and Reed, who had just stepped outside, were awestruck by the size of Rosa\u2019s backyard\u2014which might as well have been a park all its own with how big it was\u2014but also by the tables she had already set, and the food she had already prepared in expectation of all of her guests.\n\n\"So, como les guasta?\" Rosa eagerly asked as she stepped out of the house and into her yard. \n\nIn reply, everyone began praising Rosa's work. The ankylosaur wasn't one to dwell on recognition much, but something about her friend's praise made her feel satisfied.\n\nRosa spread out her arms. \"Okay, everyone, \u00a1Hora de comer!\"   \n\nRosa didn't need to repeat herself. Everyone rushed to the food table and picked up one of the starling plates sourced for them. It wasn't long before the sounds of chewing and satisfied sighs started to fill the air.\n\nWhile her friends helped themselves to the grub, Rosa took the opportunity to plug her phone into the speakers. With a tap on her music app, lively music began playing on the pair of large speakers. Instantly, the mood became electric. Everyone began tapping their feet and bobbing their heads in rhythm to the tunes. The music ranged from Latin upbeat pop to more contemporary songs, to even a few that were right up Fang and Trish\u2019s respective alleys of taste.\n\nFor the second time that day, Rosa can\u2019t help but smile ear to ear at how successful her party had was turning out.\n\n \n\n***\n\nBy the time anyone notices the setting sun, about seven hours have passed since the party\u2019s start. Seven hours of merriment that no one would ever forget. \n\nAs the day turned to evening, Rosa scanned the tables to take stock of how much food got eaten. Much to her surprise, the only things left were a bag of dipping chips and a bottle of soda.\n\nRosa can't help but giggle at how much her friends consumed. \u2018And to think I was worrying that there would be leftovers,\u2019 she told herself with a growing smirk. 'Next time, I gotta prepare even more food!'\n\n\u201cHey Rosa,\u201d Reed calls to the Aknylosaur, causing her to turn her attention back to the present. \u201cSo like, I think it\u2019s time we had that dip I brought!\u201d\n\nRosa remembered the bowl of guacamole that Reed had brought with him was still in her fridge. It was very nice and cool by now. Perfect for one final snack before ending the party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get it!\u201d Rosa chirped as she made her way back to her kitchen. Quickly finding the guacamole within her fridge, she brought out the bowl into the yard, all eyes turning towards the new food item.\n\n\u201cAight, amigos,\u201d Reed says as he pops open the last bag of chips and dips the first chip into the bowl. \u201cMade this one really special. Hope you like it!\u201d he says, eating his chip in its entirety, moaning in pleasure as he savors the flavors of his labor.\n\nNot needing to hear it twice, everyone save for Rosa\u2014who is being a polite hostess and waiting for everyone else to have their fill before eating herself\u2014reaches for a chip and digs into the guacamole. As they take a bite and savor the flavor, the intake of chip and guacamole increases. In a matter of about five minutes, the bag of chips is almost empty, and the bowl of guacamole is roughly halfway finished. \n\nOnce again, Rosa can\u2019t help but feel impressed with her friend\u2019s ability to devour food so swiftly.\n\nAt last, Rosa steps forward to take chip and try out Reed\u2019s guacamole. She picks up the largest chip that she can find, dips it into what\u2019s left of the guacamole, and goes to take a bite... \n\n...Only, she stops halfway when she hears what sounds like snickering. Not just any kind of snickering, though, but the type you\u2019d only hear from two people who are really into each other.\n\n\u201cNo, no, you\u2019re the most precious thing to me,\u201d Anon says as he hugs and plants a kiss on Fang\u2019s cheek.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, dweeb? YOU\u2019RE the most precious thing to me!\u201d Fang counters, wrapping her wings around the human and planting a big wet kiss on his cheek. Fang\u2019s kiss seems to be some kind of unspoken gun rapport as human and ptero begin calling each other ever more lovey pet names, each one punctuated with more kisses, hugs, and giggles that only grow in intensity with each passing second. As the two lovers continue their lovey-dovey act, Rosa can't help but laugh with some. giddiness. The truth was, seeing the two lovers made her a bit jealous not to have as loving a boyfriend as Anon was to Fang. She only hopes to one day find someone as good as he was... \n\nAnother set of voices catches Rosa\u2019s attention. This time coming from Naser and Naomi. The ankylosaur turns to face them and notices the two seemed to be talking about something or another. Despite telling herself that it was not her concern, she still paid attention to their words.\n\n\u201c...So yeah, I completed the 100-meter dash in less than eleven seconds! Ten and a half seconds, to be accurate!\u201d Naser boasted as he put a hand on his chest.\n\nNaomi put her hands together and gave her boyfriend a smile, one Rosa can't help but feel is very disingenuous. \u201cOh really? Because last I checked, your actual time was closer to eleven seconds!\u201d\n\nNaser let out a hurt scoff, physically recoiling as if he had gotten struck by some invisible hand. \u201cExcuse you!?\u201d he snaps, pointing a finger at Naomi. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about that! My time was ten and a half seconds! Fastest in the entire school!\u201d\n\nNaomi gives Naser a narrowed-eyed smile. \u201cOh? Are you sure you\u2019re not misremembering? Because I clearly remember your time being closer to eleven seconds and not ten and a half!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really think I wouldn\u2019t remember breaking my school record?\u201d Nasser shouts back.\n\nNaomi gives her boyfriend a devilish grin as she adjusts her glasses so that they seem to glow white for the faintest of seconds.\n\nRosa, all of a sudden, got a bad feeling about where the conversation was heading. Putting the dipped chip down on a nearby plate, she starts making her way towards the arguing couple. She doesn't make it far as her attention is again pulled away by another loud noise, this time a scream. \n\nRosa, as well as everyone else, turns to face the source of the outcry. To Rosa\u2019s dismay, the originator of the sound was none other than Stella. Only seconds after screaming, she started dashing around the yard with her hands trailing behind her back, all the while emitting a high-pitched screech that sounds less like she's trying to perform a war cry and more like she's getting badly strangled by an armless quadriplegic. \n\nRosa scowls and gets ready to go and try to snap Stella out of whatever had gotten into her head, only to stop when everyone around her began to cheer Stella on, clapping at her display of incredible stupidity and immaturity.\n\nRosa\u2019s brain stops for a second as it tries to process what was happening before her. \u2018How can they be clapping at that!?\u2019 she asks herself in a stupor. She had half a mind to bust out a chancla and smack some sense into the girl.\n\nWhatever thoughts Rosa had at that moment are completely uprooted when, to her horror\u2014yet to the delight of her friends\u2014Stella strips off all her clothes save for her bra and panties, and begins to run around the backyard, all the while flailing her limbs like she no longer had a single care in the world.\n\n\u201cYEAHHHH!!!!\u201d Stella shouts at the top of her lungs, all the while striking various strange poses that Rosa had no natural frame of reference for. \u201cI\u2019m the next Pirate King, Hokage, AND the Queen of Games!!!!\u201d With another shout, one somehow louder than the last, Stella strips the last of her clothing, leaving her in her birthday suit. She runs further away from the party, all the while performing cartwheels, rolling around on the grass like she's some kind of balled-up hedgehog, and doing what can only be described as \u2018fashion posing\u2019 in extremely flamboyant ways. \n\nStella\u2019s sudden turn towards exhibitionism seems to be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. An endless amount of cheering from everyone present, save for Rosa, follows. Rosa, meanwhile, instead looks like she is witnessing a trainwreck in real-time. Before she can finish processing the image of her best friend running around naked and shouting what to her sounds like nonsensical Japanese gibberish, the rest of her friends break out into their respective forms of chaotic behavior, all of them taking Stella\u2019s act as the cue to let go of whatever inhibitors they still had left.\n\nRosa hears a loud thud. She turns around in time to see Fang sitting on top of one of her tables, making out with Anon. The two moan and practically french each other without any regard about who was watching them. If anything, being watched seems to embolden them, making them go at each other\u2019s mouth all the harder, to the point that the ankylosaur swore they are trying to eat each other.\n\n\u201c\u00bf\u00a1Qu\u00e9 est\u00e1n haciendo!?\u201d Rosa shouts, her cheeks growing bright and red hot as she covers her eyes in an attempt at keeping her catholic eyes virgin pure.\n\nNeither Anon nor Fang pays Rosa any attention as Anon climbs on top of the table and falls right upon Fang, who in turn wraps Anon in her wings and cradles him in a cocoon of gray feathers as their kissing slowly begins to turn into something far more riske.\n\nRosa starts fuming in rage at her friend\u2019s display of lewd affection. She turns around in time to see Naomi and Naser pressing their foreheads to each other.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m telling you, I really did run a full mile in under five minutes!\u201d Naser shouts into Naomi\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cLiar! If you ran it that fast, you\u2019d be on pace for some kind of world record!\u201d Naomi snaps right back at Naser\u2019s face. \u201cBesides, I can run a mile in five minutes even, and that\u2019s on the records!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t believe that I can run a mile under that time!?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that unless I see it, I WON\u2019T believe you!\u201d\n\nNaser takes a step back, his mouth agape and his eyes wide in what can be best described as \u2018abject horror.\u2019 Meanwhile, Naomi sports a look of smug victory, as if the dino was 100% convinced that she was in the absolute right and that nothing her boyfriend could do would prove her otherwise.\n\n\u201cOh. Oh! It\u2019s on now!\u201d Naser said as he removed his trademark jacket and unbuttoned his black long sleeve shirt. He tossed both garments aside with a great deal of flourish as he puffed out his now bare, well-toned, and chiseled chest and shot a self-righteous grin towards Naomi. \u201cI\u2019m about to prove to you just how wrong you are!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, you are not!\u201d Naomi countered, also removing her shirt and leaving her wearing what looked like a sports bra. \u201cI\u2019m about to prove to YOU just how wrong you are!\u201d\n\nThe couple crouch down in preparation. After the two take deep breaths, they take off sprinting. Their feet dig into the grass and propel them forward with such speed and ferocity that the two almost become blurs in the distance.\n\nRosa\u2019s too occupied trying to make sense of Naser and Naomi\u2019s \u2018competition\u2019 to notice Trish fiddling with her speakers. By the time she notices her friend, Trish has already plugged her phone into the master speaker and was standing on top of it. She removes her trademark yellow hoodie and holds it in her hand, leaving her wearing only a tiny black tank top that did her no favor in hiding her enormous breasts.\n\n\u201cAnd now I will dance the song of my people!\u201d the triceratops shouts at the top of her lungs as she taps on her phone and drops it right next to the speaker. Soon as she does, the song \u2018Walk the Dinosaur\u2019 begins blaring at a volume that can't be healthy for normal hearing. As the song hits its first major crescendo, Trish spins her hoodie over her head, all the while swinging her body side to side. When the chorus kicked in, she then dropped into a low crouch and begins twerking her ass in rhythm to the music, all the while hollering and making what almost sounds like money noises.\n\nRosa\u2019s left eye twitches in rage as she witnesses the display of mild specieism from her triceratops friend. Her anger only intensifies when she hears cheering. She snaps her head to the right and sets a glare on Reed, who seems to be the only other person aside from her who hasn\u2019t fallen into some kind of debaucherous spell. Instead, he only sits back on a chair with a cup of soda in one hand, a small bowl of his guacamole in the other, and a wide goofy grin on his lips.\n\nRosa\u2019s eyes snap wide. She marches up to the nacho chip she put aside earlier. \u2018Everyone started going Loco en el coco after they ate Reed\u2019s dip,\u2019 she reasons as she picks up the chip and takes a small bite out of the chip in her hand. \n\nAt first, she\u2019s floored by how delicious it is. Sour, yet savory, spicy, yet also sweet. The flavors mixed in so perfectly that Rosa\u2019s very much tempted to pick up another chip and have herself another bite. Using the self-restrained taught to her by her catholic faith, she stops herself and instead tastes the guacamole; she REALLY tastes it, swishing the flavor in her mouth and savoring even the tiniest of sensations her tongue.\n\nThat's when she tastes something else mixed into the guacamole, something that isn't avocado or tomato or onion or spice or lime juice. Something that can't be natural in the conventional sense of the word. Something that makes the most instinctual of parts of her brain demand more and more...\n\nShe spits out the contents of her mouth before they could further cloud her judgment and turns to face Reed, who is still cheering Trish on as she continued her decadent dance on top of the speaker. \n\n\u201cReed, what did you put in the guacamole?\u201d Rosa asks as she holds the half-eaten chip dipped in the sauce in front of the pink stoner.\n\nReed scratched his head and raised an eyebrow, almost as if he was trying to be reflective about the question. \u201cGuacamole...?\u201d he asks innocently enough. Still, it\u2019s clear that he, too, doesn\u2019t quite know how to answer Rosa\u2019s question, even if he was the one to make the dip that had sent everyone over into la-la land.\n\nRosa crushed the chip in her hand as her face turned a deep shade of crimson. She once more began fuming, steam leaving her nostrils as anger started taking her over. In a moment of uncharacteristic rage, the orange ankylosaur raised her first and punched Reed square in the face, sending him sprawling into the floor. She wanted so bad to turn that anger on the rest of her friends next, but temperance once more returned to Rosa as she tried calming herself down with deep breaths. She looks down at Reed, ready to utter an apology for her sudden blow, but Reed\u2019s eyes spun in place as a wide goofy grin formed on his lips. \u201cOh, look at all the pretty stars! Weeee!\u201d he said to himself in a plain stupor.\n\nRosa gives up on that idea with a sigh and instead turns to face her friend\u2019s shenanigans. She pondered how to best get them all back under control. \u2018They are naughty cabrones, and the only way to control cabrones is\u2026\u201d\n\nRosa grimaces and turns away from her friends to face her house. Without another word, she marches back inside, past her living room, and towards her room. \n\n\u201cTiempos desesperados requieren masuras desesperadas,\u201d Rosa tells herself as she approaches her room. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d have to resort to using \u2018it,\u2019\u201d she says ominously as she pushes her door open and walks up to her closet. She slides the doors open and pulls out a heavy metallic briefcase with a combination lock. She next walks up to a nearby wall, upon which is a painting of her Mother Mary. She grabs one of the corners of the painting. She pulls on it, causing it to slide to the right side, revealing a neat hole upon which is a glass box labeled \u2018En caso de demonios, hereticos, y idiotas corriendo en tu casa, rompe el vidrio.\u2019\n\nRosa breaks the glass with her bare fists without hesitation and reaches inside. There, she pulls a piece of ornate paper with the numbers \u2018737\u2019 written in fancy calligraphy.\n\nWith a nod, she walks back to the briefcase and pops the numbers into the tumbler combination, at which point the latches spring up. She grabs the lid and, with another sigh, pops open the briefcase.\n\nThere is a hiss as the lid rises. A bright golden light bathes Rosa\u2019s face as a few clouds of fog leave the box. Performing a sign of the cross on herself, Rosa reaches into the case and, with all the reverence that she can muster, grasps the item within.\n\n\u201cEl arma para superar todas las otras armas,\u201d Rosa whispers in an awestruck tone as he pulls out a golden-colored sandal with ornate ribbons, a silver rosary tied around the front and trailing behind like some kind of flowing flourish, and a glow that bordered on the supernatural. On top was the embroiled image of none other than Raptor Jesus, his brow set to a crease and his arms crossed in obvious disappointment.\n\nWith a grim expression on her face, Rosa smacks the sandal on her hand, which emits a small flash of light and a thunderous, echoing sound. She turns her attention back to her yard from out of her room\u2019s window. There, she can see her friend\u2019s still acting like a bunch of idiots. Fang and Anon were now actively trying to remove each other\u2019s clothes. Naser and Naomi continued running around the yard while still locked in their argument. Trish continued to dance on top of the speaker, her pants now removed, leaving her only wearing her tank top and panties. Stella was trying to wrestle a tree in the distance, and reed was still lying on the grass, looking like he had a run-in with a pro boxer.\n\nKnowing what she needs to do, Rosa closes the briefcase and grips the sandal on her hand tighter. Without another word, she steps out of her room and towards the backyard, all the while brandishing her holy chancla with equal parts reverence and harmful intent...","Title":"The Garden Party","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed, Stella, Rosa, Naser, Naomi and Anon","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Rangto","Summary":"It's close to the end of the year, And Rosa decides she's going to toss her friends a Garden Party at her house.

It had come down to this: the finals of the Yu-Di-No tournament, a monumental battle of cards that shook Valcaldera to its very core. Friendships were tested and found wanting, anime cliches were uttered and discovered that they didn\u2019t really sound that great in English, and the blood of a thousand paper-cuts from dramatic top-decking had been spilled. But what was the prize that these two titans of the tournament fought for, a prize that threated the very foundation of their friendship? One. Million. Dino-nuggies.\n\n\u201cGo, Inverted High-Priestesses, attack!\u201d Stella roared, nearly assured her victory. Veins stood out on her body like thick cords, distorting her normal passive face into a rictus grimace mad with power. Anon could only shake his head, for the onetime friend he now faced wasn\u2019t even referencing the correct character. Her monster, a larger-than-life stylized image of herself, a shimmer hologram towering above the duelists, raised its arms in attack, the cycles of the moon beginning to rotate faster and faster around its blindfolded head. Energy crackled, bringing a smell of ozone to the arena, which didn\u2019t really make sense because it was a hologram, but that did little to dissuade Anon. Standing his ground, his expressionless face a vision of determination, Anon knew he had one more trick up his sleeve.\n\n\u2018You won\u2019t defeat me, Stella,\u2019 Anon thought, his eyes narrowing. \u2018I always fight for those who believe! For my friends! For myself! And for my QT-Ptero Gee Eff!\u2019 He was too determined to notice Fang, standing around the arena with the rest of the gang, facepalming hard at Anon\u2019s autistic mumbling. \u2018Stella, I will defeat you. As a rival who walked the road of weebdom with me, and as a friend!\u2019\n\n\u201cUltimateo Burstooooooooooo!\u201d Throwing her hands out, Stella ordered her final attack, choosing to deliver this line in broken Engrish for dramatic effect. The Inverted High-Priestess\u2019 attack rocketed forth, the eight phases of the moon cascading towards Anon in shimmer streaks of golden light.\n\n\u201cReverse card, open! Mathematician\u2019s Textbook!\u201d Revealing a card illustrated with the collector\u2019s edition art-book of Saturnia slipped between the pages of an enormously heavy textbook, Anon\u2019s hoped to save his own monster, from Stella\u2019s would-be fatal attack.\n\n\u201cFutile! I activate Shitpost Absorption!\u201d Stella\u2019s grin was that of total triumph as she dramatically revealed her spell card, accidently dropping it as she held it between the tips of her fingers. Undeterred, Stella quickly bent over to pick the card up, resuming her monologue. \u201cThe moment your monster\u2019s Post Count goes up, those posts are absorbed into my monster\u2019s Post count, bumping it!\u201d\n\n\u201cNani?!\u201d Anon cried, his eyes wide with shock. \u2018The High-Priestess\u2019 Post Count went up another 500 posts!\u2019 \n\n\u201cHahahaha! Shatter to pieces along with your Trigger Paladin and your lover\u2019s card, Amber-Eyes, Anon!\u201d So confident was Stella in her victory that she paid no heed to Trish\u2019s distraught cries over her racial slur. Indeed, the Inverted High-Priestess\u2019 attack seemed sure to seal the duel, moving inexorably but also incredible slowly towards Anon\u2019s side of the board. \n\n\u201cThe end\u2026\u201d Sage mumbled to themself, hidden from view and totally unknown to everyone else despite being in the teaser-trailer for this episode.\n\n\u201c\u00a1Ella lo hizo!\u201d Rosa cheered, bounding up and down on Stella\u2019s side of the arena in a way that made all men within a fifty-yard radius subconsciously wipe the sweat from their brow.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026?! Annnnoooooon!\u201d Fang cried, running into the arena despite just having been there, as the attack was about to land. \n\n\u201cI won\u2026\u201d Her words barely audible over the totally unnecessarily loud attack, Stella stood wide-eyed, almost surprised she was about to accomplish her goal. \u201cI was sure he would have one more\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure!\u201d \n\nWell, sorry Stella, you tried.\n\n\u201cStella\u2026 You can pile on the cliches, but it\u2019s weeb!!\u201d Thrusting his finger decisively at his opponent, Anon seem undeterred that he was about to be eliminated from the Yu-Di-No tournament. \n\n\u201cWhat was that?!\u201d Stella\u2019s eyes were even wider now, her unbelievably racist space-buns beginning to unravel.\n\n\u201cDid you really think you would win, bearing a burden of anime and cliches?!\u201d Anon retorted, adjusting the Golden Puzzle RAYmba hung around his neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Stella waved her arm dismissively, as if to cut Anon\u2019s words out of the air. \u201cThere\u2019s no way your Monster could defeat the Inverted High-Priestess!\u201d \n\n\u201cThen I\u2019m going to show you\u2026the last attack that will grant my victory! Reverse card, open!\u201d\n\nReed scratched his head, leaning in to whisper to the still-indignant Trish. \u201cI\u2019m confused, didn\u2019t he already play the Reverse card?\u201d\n\n\u201cFusion Cancel!\u201d Anon, seemingly ignorant of anything other than the duel, revealed his OTHER amazingly conveniently-played-for-this-exact-situation card that he hoped would save his monster. \n\n\u2018Fusion Cancel?\u2019 Stella\u2019s thoughts were filled with sputtering rage, her eyes bloodshot.\n\n\u201cIt splits up one Fusion Monster on the field and negates their attack for the turn!\u201d Continuing to narrate his card\u2019s own actions despite both participants seemingly understanding the rules of the very game they played, Anon narrowed his eyes dramatically.\n\n\u2018Did he know I was going to play the Inverted High-Priestess\u2026?!\u2019 Stella had not said anything for several minutes, and Rosa was beginning to worry. The Fusion Cancel card began to take effect, the hologram of Stella\u2019s Inverted High-Priestess beginning to spasm violently as it was consumed with white light. \u2018My Inverted High-Priestess\u2026is splitting apart!\u2019 Finally, the deed was done, as the Inverted High-Priestess split into its component parts with a very poorly done glass-shattering effect. Soon, only the High-Priestess, looking not quite-like the Inverted High-Priestess but close enough to not warrant describing again, and a fanciful picture of Naomi in a white robe representing the Inverted Temperance remained. \n\n\u201cThere are now two more Tarot-Types on the field! Increasing Trigger Paladin\u2019s Post Count!\u201d The stoic black warrior standing in front of Anon grew in power, gaining an extra horn on his crest. Reed had to hold back Trish at this point, the diminutive purple dino attempting to rush the arena in anger. \u201cAnd because the fusion of Inverted Empress was canceled, your turn comes to an end!\u201d\n\n\u201cNani\u2026?!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Turn!\u201d Anon didn\u2019t let Stella continue, knowing that if she started talking in Japanese she would never stop. \u201cDraw-o!\u201d Ripping the card off the top of his deck like a jackass and nearly causing all his cards to spill to the ground, Anon didn\u2019t even bother to look at it before he started running his mouth off. \u201cStella! This card will tear apart the weebiness that controls your heart! I active a Magic Card from my hand!\u201d Anon inserted the newly drawn card into his duel-deck, the hunk of plastic and cardboard he had made himself somehow. \u201cDiffusion Stair Fall!\u201d The hologram version of the card appeared next to him, depicting a human tumbling down a large flight of stairs. \n\n\u2018Diffusion Stair Fall!\u2019 Stella mumbled in her head, doing her best impression of a Snoot-al Gear Solid character.\n\n\u201cBy paying 1000 of my Post Number, I can direct my Paladin\u2019s attack order to cover every monster on your side of the field! That means Trigger Paladin can attack all three Tarot-Eyes at the same time!\u201d\n\n\u2018Each of the Tarot-Eyes has only a 3000 Post Count\u2026! And his Trigger Paladin has over nine-thousand!\u2019 \n\n\u201cTrigger Paladin, attack!\u201d It was taking Reed and Naser to hold back Trish at this point, but neither duelist seemed to care: Their eyes were fixed on Anon\u2019s monster as it raised its bass on high, the body of the might guitar beginning to generate a halo of energy. \n\n\u2018Stella\u2026 You won\u2019t achieve true victory with such a clich\u00e9 plot line!\u2019 Somehow, Anon\u2019s clothes were fluttering as if in a strong breeze, despite the authorly previously asserting that the monsters were just holograms.\n\n\u201cBeyond Math! Anger Trigger Warning!!\u201d The Paladin\u2019s bass began sending waves of searing energy cascading across the arena, slicing neatly through each of Stella\u2019s monsters. One by one they fell, dissipating into nothingness even as their owner\u2019s Poster Number began tumbling down to zero. Rosa fell to her knees, tears forming in her eyes as she was forced to watch her friend get Deus Ex Machina\u2019d into a loss. Standing next to Anon\u2019s friends, Sage laughed, still seemingly escaping notice despite being right fucking next to them. Stella\u2019s face fell, her tail coiling around her leg as at long last, her thread was auto-saged.\n\n\u2018Stella. You lost to me now\u2026 But you still have to defeat your own weebiness!\u2019\n\nThe only response was the sound of the collective facepalming at Anon\u2019s mumbling.","Title":"Anon And Stella - Yu-Di-No","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Trish, Reed, Stella, Rosa, Sage and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous"},"Bad Bitch Stella Alternate.txt":{"path":["Stella","Bad Bitch Stella Alternate.txt"],"text":"Title: Bad Bitch Stella Alternate\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Stella, Fang and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Examanon\n\n\nDa SIDEplot: Stella gets Anon to watch anime with her. Sexy shenanigans happen.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Remind me again why I'm here?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Haha, to watch the new pilot of SAO with me of course!\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Yeah, so, WHY am I here?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Oh come on, it can't be that bad. I know season two was kinda weak, but this is gonna be infinitely better cause...\"\n\nShe drones on after that, but I'm not really listening till she elbows me in the side.\n\n[Stella]\n\"...plus you have me for yourself. Isn't that cool?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Uh-huh\"\n\nWe're just outside her room in the Volcano High dorms. I didn't even know there were dorms.\n\nShe's sharing a room with Rosa, they've told me. I assume that's how they got to be friends to begin with, because I can hardly imagine any other scenario in which anyone would willingly befriend Stella.\n\nI mean, she's okay but her random weird stuff is just... Weird. Like with the cards.\n\nIf only she had normal interests she'd be like an 8\/10 qt3.14. Or if she kept quiet.\n\nShe opens the door and ushers me inside. For some reason I was expecting the walls to be covered with pink plush carpeting, a rug and bedsheets to go with it. With pink everything, really.\n\nThe room looks like just another dorm room though. Cupboards, a bunk bed, two desks, and a mini fridge. There are some school supplies and clothes thrown around.\n\nThe only out of ordinary thing are the posters. Or to be more specific, the absence of them. Almost the entire wall is covered with dots and lines, some of which I recognize as constellations.\n\nWhat I guess to be moon cycles is also up there right next to the bed.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Sorry, I didn't really have the time to clean up.\"\n\nShe's blushing as she says it. Kinda cute.\n\nWithout much ceremony, Stella picks up a laptop from one of the desks, and puts it on the top bunk.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Alright Anon, get up! I'll be back in a sec.\"\n\nShe disappears behind a door that I didn't even notice was there, the drawings on it blending in with the wall too much.\n\nSo um. She wants me to...\n\nUhhhhhh...\n\nI was under the impression that we were going to like, sit in chairs? Maybe a big sofa.\n\nBut not share a bed. A single bed, mind you.\n\nUgh, how am I going to explain this to Fang?\n\n...\n\nFine.\n\nI climb the ladder and sit upon the edge, my legs dangling down.\n\nThere are some plushies by her pillow. One of them could be a rabbit, but the others are various nondescript figures that I can't place.\n\nHer bed smells nice.\n\nTrue to her word, Stella returns just a few moments later.\n\nWait. Oh my fucking god.\n\nIs she fucking cosplaying?\n\nIn place of her usual shirt and short jeans attire she's donned a weirdly - or should I say tactically - cut green-white leotard kind of deal, a white scarf, and a blue wig.\n\nEven with my limited knowledge, I can tell that she's supposed to be the new heroine from the season three trailers. Whatshername.\n\nShe's even got the tiddy for it.\n\nThe only thing breaking the image is that spindly leg grab with her tail Stella often does.\n\n[Stella]\n\"W-well, how is it?\"\n\nThere's that blush again.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Umm, nice?\"\n\nI don't know what kind of answer she was expecting, but she seems content with \"nice\".\n\nShe climbs up halfway, and motions for me to lay properly on the bed, instead of sideways.\n\nOh no, she seriously wants to do it like that? Being pressed shoulder to shoulder on this narrow fucking bed?\n\nNot to mention other extremities...\n\nFine. She won that bet after all.\n\nUgh, I'll never live this down.\n\nI shuffle my body around, careful not to knock Stella off the ladder, and lay on my stomach as close to the wall as I can get.\n\nShe gets up next to me, and puts her laptop on the pillow.\n\nI want to point out that this way the poor machine will overheat and get full of dust and shit, but I don't really care that much. I just want to get this thing over with.\n\nOur bodies unavoidably press together as Stella gets comfortable. With her suit cut as it is, I'm very sure that her butt touches me multiple times.\n\nHow is this not bothering her? I'm sure that my face is plain red right about now.\n\nThank fuck I'm laying dick down and don't have to be concerned about Stella noticing my hard-on.\n\nAfter a few minutes of browsing we find the stream that she wants to watch. Her girlish excitement is kinda cute, I guess.\n\nShe's constantly babbling on something about this or that idol or whatever, who is apparently the hostess.\n\nEventually the intro starts up, and I get deafened by a shrieking Stella.\n\n[Stella]\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\nShe grabs one of her bigger plushies, and muffles her screams.\n\nNot for long.\n\nAs soon as the actual opening comes on, she sings along in a very, very broken Wapanese.\n\nAlmost as if she forgot that I was there.\n\nI try to be nice and gulp down the cringefest about to come on. Truth be told, her out of bounds enthusiasm moves some long forgotten part of me.\n\nWhen was the last time I browsed headlines without looking for the next tortanic?\n\nI push the existential dread aside and return my attention to the show.\n\nThe opening has ended, and now we are following some generic looking anime goons. It really isn't anything special, but Stella doesn't seem to care.\n\nHer legs are up in a crossed position to stop them from running an invisible treadmill, and her tail is non-stop thrashing around.\n\nEvery now and again it wraps around one of her legs, but often she mistakes my leg for hers.\n\nThe closeness and touchiness of this girl quickly push my alarms to maximum level, and I can't even concentrate on the episode.\n\nInstead I'm wiping sweat off my brow, and trying not to pay attention to her ass jiggle as she jumps every time something quote un-quote exciting happens.\n\nUnwelcome thoughts crowd my mind, like \"Does Stella even have a boyfriend?\" and \"Oh fuck I can't tell Fang about any of this.\".\n\nThe episode and stream eventually end, and she once again screams into the plushie.\n\nThere's a cliffhanger that I don't really care about, but Stella is on edge.\n\n[Stella]\n\"OmigoshAnonwasn'tthatthecoolestthingyoueversaw?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Okay.\"\n\nI have no idea what the fuck she just said.\n\nShe turns onto her back, staring wistfully up at the ceiling.\n\nOne more scream, and it looks like she's composed herself enough to actually speak coherently.\n\n[Stella]\n\"That was pretty cool, right?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Don't you think that Dinon was cool? She's so brave!\"\n\nI have to carefully think about what I say here. Even though it's Stella we're talking about, I don't want to take these giddy feels away from her.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Y-yeah, it wasn't that bad.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Can I go now?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Aww, you really didn't like it then? But it was so AAAAAAH! PEW PEW\"\n\nShe's even doing the finger guns, in my face of course.\n\n[Anon]\n\"It um... It's just not to my taste?\"\n\n...\n\nShe goes silent after that, tugging on her sticky leotard awkwardly.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Will you watch the next episode with me?\"\n\nI'm so flabbergasted that it takes me quite a few seconds to come up with a reply. Both because of the question itself, and her tender voice as she asks it.\n\nIt hits me that she probably has no one to watch anime with, despite it being a huge part of her life.\n\nMaybe she gets Rosa to do it every now and again, but it's not like Rosa would care about this stuff.\n\n[Anon]\n\"This is pretty important to you, right?\"\n\nShe blushes, hiding her face with the plushie till I can barely look into her eyes.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI will regret this. I will SO regret this.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Okay.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Really, you would?\"\n\nShe muffles another scream, obviously excited.\n\n[Anon]\n\"But umm, I really have to go now. I uh, promised Fang that uhhhhh...\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Yeah, yeah, okay. I gotta study anyway.\"\n\nI wait for a second or two for her to get off the bed, but it's apparent that she won't. She's just looking at me expectantly.\n\nFine.\n\nI try to climb over her, touching her as little as I can.\n\nDontlookathertits.\n\nOnce again, I feel her tail wrap around one of my legs and I stop dead in my tracks. Practically doing a handstand above her.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Uhh, Stel--\"\n\nShe cuts me off.\n\nWith.\n\nA.\n\nFucking.\n\nKiss.\n\nI'm frozen on the spot, the best I can manage is not letting my hands give away.\n\nIn that moment, I'm unnaturally aware of the heat and scent of her body, how her tail tightens around my muscles. Even the ever so faint strawberry flavor of her lipstick.\n\nIt takes all of my willpower not to return the kiss. I fact, I might even fail a bit in this regard.\n\nSadly-- I MEAN THANKFULLY, it doesn't last long, Stella withdraws with one last - actually painful - love bite into my lower lip.\n\nShe retreats behind the plushie till once again only her eyes are visible. At the same time, her tail lets go of me.\n\n[Stella]\n\"You should leave now, Anon.\"\n\nBicth what the fuck.\n\nYeah, I will be leaving.\n\nI quite literally spin-fall off the bed akin to my morning ritual, dashing out the fucking door as soon as my feet land on the ground.\n\n* * *\n\nMy head is spinning as I exit the building.\n\nWhat the fuck just happened.\n\nI light one of the smokes that Fang lent me, taking a long drag.\n\nI'm starting to believe that the ONLY reason Stella wanted me here today was to pull this stunt.\n\nFucking hell.\n\nNow I seriously can't tell Fang about any of this.\n\nI notice residue of Stella's lipstick on the filter.\n\nShitfuck.\n\nWiping my mouth reveals that not only am I throughoutly covered with it, but that her love bite actually drew blood.\n\nWell here's the conversation: \"Oh yeah hey Fang, nah don't worry about it I just headbutted the sidewalk haha!\"\n\nRaptor Jesus give me strength...\n\nI think about going back in there and force Stella to explain. Although, what is there for her to explain?\n\nAn affair is pretty fucking straightforward.\n\n...\n\nThe worst part is that I don't exactly hate Stella for this. In fact, the thought of an actual affair is, uh, exciting.\n\nI look down at my hand, smeared with lipstick and my own blood.\n\nSlowly I lift it up to my mouth and lick it.\n\nMaybe I'm imagining it, but there seems to be a slight strawberry flavor to it.\n\nOnce again I contemplate going back inside, except this time very much NOT to confront Stella about her scheme.\n\n...\n\nI shake my head, trying to get these damn thoughts out of it. I wipe my face again and finish the cigarette.\n\nFucking Stella.\n\nNo point in lingering here anymore, so I start making my way to the nearest bus stop.\n\nChecking my phone, there are two notifications.\n\nA message from Fang, and... Oh god. One from Stella.\n\nIt's from after I've left. Maybe she came to her senses and wants to apologize.\n\nOr maybe not. Oh. Oh my.\n\nA very provocative image of her butt, her skintight leotard almost entirely peeled off, showing off a cute pink thong.\n\nwhatthefuckwhatthefuckwhatthefuck\n\nHot tho.\n\nOh god, she's typing a message.\n\nWas she literally waiting for me to see it?\n\n[Stella]\n\"r u still smoking?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"cum back\"\n\nShe tops it off with a smiling devil emoji.\n\nMy legs turn to jelly, and if it weren't for a convenient nearby bench I surely would have fallen to the ground.\n\nTalk about headbutting the sidewalk.\n\nI don't even want to know how she knew that I stayed for a smoke.\n\nLet's be the bigger man here.\n\n[Anon]\n\"how about no\"\n\nTakes me forever to correct all the typos with my shaking hands, but I want the message to be clear.\n\nShe starts typing up a response, then stops.\n\nTwice.\n\nThrice.\n\nFuck this.\n\nI decide to check the message from Fang, maybe that'll calm me a little.\n\nIt's also from after I've left the room. That's not a good sign.\n\nCan't be that bad, she would have called me if it was.\n\nRight?\n\n[Fang]\n\"hv fun c u tomorrow :V\"\n\nWhat?\n\nSTELLA WHAT DID YOU DO\n\nThis stops now.

One of them could be a rabbit, but the others are various nondescript figures that I can't place.\n\nHer bed smells nice.\n\nTrue to her word, Stella returns just a few moments later.\n\nWait. Oh my fucking god.\n\nIs she fucking cosplaying?\n\nIn place of her usual shirt and short jeans attire she's donned a weirdly - or should I say tactically - cut green-white leotard kind of deal, a white scarf, and a blue wig.\n\nEven with my limited knowledge, I can tell that she's supposed to be the new heroine from the season three trailers. Whatshername.\n\nShe's even got the tiddy for it.\n\nThe only thing breaking the image is that spindly leg grab with her tail Stella often does.\n\n[Stella]\n\"W-well, how is it?\"\n\nThere's that blush again.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Umm, nice?\"\n\nI don't know what kind of answer she was expecting, but she seems content with \"nice\".\n\nShe climbs up halfway, and motions for me to lay properly on the bed instead of sideways.\n\nOh no, she seriously wants to do it like that? Being pressed shoulder to shoulder on this narrow fucking bed?\n\nNot to mention other extremities...\n\nFine. She won that bet after all.\n\nUgh, I'll never live this down.\n\nI shuffle my body around, careful not to knock Stella off the ladder, and lay on my stomach as close to the wall as I can get.\n\nShe gets up next to me, and puts her laptop on the pillow.\n\nI want to point out that this way the poor machine will overheat and get full of dust and shit, but I don't really care that much. I just want to get this thing over with.\n\nOur bodies unavoidably press together as Stella gets comfortable. With her suit cut as it is, I'm very sure that her butt touches me multiple times.\n\nHow is this not bothering her? I'm sure that my face is plain red right about now.\n\nThank fuck I'm laying dick down and don't have to be concerned about Stella noticing my hard-on.\n\nAfter a few minutes of browsing we find the stream that she wants to watch. Her girlish excitement is kinda cute, I guess.\n\nShe's constantly babbling on something about this or that idol or whatever, who is apparently the hostess.\n\nEventually the intro starts up, and I get deafened by a shrieking Stella.\n\n[Stella]\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\nShe grabs one of her bigger plushies, and muffles her screams.\n\nNot for long.\n\nAs soon as the actual opening comes on, she sings along in a very, very broken Wapanese.\n\nAlmost as if she forgot that I was there.\n\nI try to be nice and gulp down the cringefest about to come on. Truth be told, her out of bounds enthusiasm moves some long forgotten part of me.\n\nWhen was the last time I browsed headlines without looking for the next tortanic?\n\nI push the existential dread aside and return my attention to the show.\n\nThe opening has ended, and now we are following some generic looking anime goons. It really isn't anything special, but Stella doesn't seem to care.\n\nHer legs are up in a crossed position to stop them from running an invisible treadmill, and her tail is non-stop thrashing around.\n\nEvery now and again it wraps around one of her legs, but often she mistakes my leg for hers.\n\nThe closeness and touchiness of this girl quickly push my alarms to maximum level, and I can't even concentrate on the episode.\n\nInstead I'm wiping sweat off my brow, and trying not to pay attention to her ass jiggle as she jumps every time something quote un-quote exciting happens.\n\nUnwelcome thoughts crowd my mind, like \"Does Stella even have a boyfriend?\" and \"Oh fuck I can't tell Fang about any of this.\".\n\nThe episode and stream eventually end, and she once again screams into the plushie.\n\nThere's a cliffhanger that I don't really care about, but Stella is on edge.\n\n[Stella]\n\"OmigoshAnonwasn'tthatthecoolestthingyoueversaw?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Okay.\"\n\nI have no idea what the fuck she just said.\n\nShe turns onto her back, staring wistfully up at the ceiling.\n\nOne more scream, and it looks like she's composed herself enough to actually speak coherently.\n\n[Stella]\n\"That was pretty cool, right?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Don't you think that Dinon was cool? She's so brave!\"\n\nI have to carefully think about what I say here. Even though it's Stella we're talking about, I don't want to take these giddy feels away from her.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Y-yeah, it wasn't that bad.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Can I go now?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Aww, you really didn't like it then? But it was so AAAAAAH! PEW PEW\"\n\nShe's even doing the finger guns, in my face of course.\n\n[Anon]\n\"It um... It's just not to my taste?\"\n\n...\n\nShe goes silent after that, tugging on her sticky leotard awkwardly.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Will you watch the next episode with me?\"\n\nI'm so flabbergasted that it takes me quite a few seconds to come up with a reply. Both because of the question itself, and her tender voice as she asks it.\n\nNot like I in any shape, way, or form benefitted her experience. I mean, she just watched the episode like normal. I didn't even need to be here.\n\nIt hits me that she probably has no one to watch anime with, despite it being a huge part of her life.\n\nMaybe she gets Rosa to do it every now and again, but it's not like Rosa would care about this stuff.\n\n[Anon]\n\"This is pretty important to you, right?\"\n\nShe blushes, hiding her face with the plushie till I can barely look into her eyes.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI will regret this. I will SO regret this.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Okay.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Really, you would?\"\n\nShe muffles another scream, obviously excited.\n\n[Anon]\n\"But umm, I really have to go now. I uh, promised Fang that uhhhhh...\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Yeah, yeah, okay. I gotta study anyway.\"\n\nI wait for a second or two for her to get off the bed, but it's apparent that she won't. She's just looking at me expectantly.\n\nFine.\n\nI try to climb over her, touching her as little as I can.\n\nDontlookathertits.\n\nOnce again, I feel her tail wrap around one of my legs and I stop dead in my tracks. Practically doing a handstand above her.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Uhh, Stel--\"\n\nShe cuts me off.\n\nWith.\n\nA.\n\nFucking.\n\nKiss.\n\nI'm frozen on the spot, the best I can manage is not letting my hands give away as she grabs onto the collar of my jacket.\n\nIn that moment, I'm unnaturally aware of the heat and scent of her body, how her tail tightens around my muscles. Even the ever so faint strawberry flavor of her lipstick.\n\nIt takes all of my willpower not to return the kiss. I fact, I might even fail a bit in this regard.\n\nSadly-- I MEAN THANKFULLY, it doesn't last long, Stella withdraws with one last - actually painful - love bite into my lower lip.\n\nShe retreats behind the plushie till once again only her eyes are visible. At the same time, her tail lets go of me.\n\n[Stella]\n\"You should leave now, Anon.\"\n\nBitch what the fuck.\n\nYeah, I will be leaving.\n\nI quite literally spin-fall off the bed akin to my morning ritual, dashing out the fucking door as soon as my feet land on the ground.\n\n* * *\n\nMy head is spinning as I exit the building.\n\nWhat the fuck just happened.\n\nI light one of the smokes that Fang lent me, taking a long drag.\n\nI'm starting to believe that the ONLY reason Stella wanted me here today was to pull this stunt.\n\nFucking hell.\n\nNow I seriously can't tell Fang about any of this.\n\nI notice residue of Stella's lipstick on the filter.\n\nShitfuck.\n\nWiping my mouth reveals that not only am I throughoutly covered with it, but that her love bite actually drew blood.\n\nWell here's the conversation: \"Oh yeah hey Fang, nah don't worry about it I just headbutted the sidewalk haha!\"\n\nRaptor Jesus give me strength...\n\nI think about going back in there and force Stella to explain. Although, what is there for her to explain?\n\nAn affair is pretty fucking straightforward.\n\nThe worst part is that I don't exactly hate Stella for this.\n\nI look down at my hand, smeared with lipstick and my own blood.\n\nSlowly I lift it up to my mouth, and lick it.\n\nMaybe I'm imagining it, but there seems to be a slight strawberry flavor to it.\n\n...\n\nI shake my head, trying to get these damn thoughts out of it. I wipe my face again and finish the cigarette.\n\nFucking Stella.\n\n* * *\n\nThe rest of the evening goes by with me trying to figure out how to explain this to Fang, but to no avail. I seriously doubt that I'll be able to hold a poker face next time I see Stella.\n\nTo top it all off, there's a part of me that keeps going back to that kiss, and how I felt seeing Stella be genuinely excited for her shitty anime.\n\nThere's no denying that I've enjoyed both of these feelings and the excitement that comes with like, secret love in the woods.\n\nI heat up some leftover food, but can't be bothered to really take a bite.\n\nAfter a quick shower I go straight to bed, skipping the nightly round of shitposting.\n\nI toss and turn for a long time, unable to get the image of Stella in that tight suit out of my head.\n\nSo much so, that I end up messaging her about it. It's about midnight, but she might be up.\n\nMaybe if I don't bring up the kiss she won't either?\n\nWait, will she think that I'm encouraging this shit if I message her?\n\n...and ask for nudes?\n\nNnnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\n\nYou're right boner, what's the worst that could happen?\n\n[Anon]\n\"hey u sleeping\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"r u still wearing the thing\"\n\nPunctuation is for retards.\n\nA minute or so later she replies.\n\n[Stella]\n\"hi Anon!!! <3\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"yeh, y?\"\n\nUhhhh...\n\nA fucking heart right out the door. I should stop.\n\nI type in \"send a pic\", but then erase it without sending.\n\nThen I do the same with \"send nudes\", \"send feet\", and \"bobs and vagene\".\n\nI ALMOST do fucking send \"bitch lasagna\" by accident.\n\nAfter that I just start typing in and deleting random letters so that she thinks I'm actually writing a message.\n\nWhat am I even doing? This is so wrong. I have a girlfriend for fucks sake.\n\nBut then again, my dick knows exactly what it is I want. Plus it's kind of adorkable that she still has it on.\n\nFuck me here it goes.\n\n[Anon]\n\"send a pic?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"!!!\"\n\nOh no.\n\nI fucked up.\n\nDid I fuck up?\n\nYes.\n\nNo.\n\nMaybe.\n\nI don't know.\n\nCould you repeat the question?\n\nNa nana na naan naanaaa...\n\nI start zoning out, but then she really does send a picture.\n\nIt's dark - probably didn't want to alert Rosa -, but I can definitely make out two shapely legs and a tummy, for reals still in the leotard. She's in bed too.\n\nOne of her legs has her tail curled up on it. Wouldn't be Stella if it wasn't.\n\nI find myself smiling like an idiot, but horny and excited as well.\n\n[Anon]\n\"cute\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"more?\"\n\nThis won't end well, but I can't stop now.\n\n[Stella]\n\"okie gimme a sec :$\"\n\nIt actually takes her so long to send the next message that I almost fall asleep.\n\nIt's another pic, in a lit room this time. The flooring would suggest the bathroom.\n\nThe picture is of one of her hands.\n\nI don't get it, until I notice some opaque slimy goop on the end of her fingers.\n\n[Stella]\n\"sowwie daddy, had a little accident <3\"\n\nOh fuck. Oh god. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.\n\nWait that's hot as fuck.\n\nBUT OH NO\n\nDid she just fucking seriously...?\n\nI mean, I was jerking it a little to the other pic but...\n\nWell anon that's it, you're a chad now.\n\nBut this is so fucked up.\n\nMaybe... S-should I send an image back?\n\nNo, a dick pic might be over the line. It's been like, PG-13 so far.\n\n[Anon]\n\"hawt\"\n\nShe sends another pic not long after. It would be of her boobs, but it's all blurry. Like she fell while taking it.\n\nHer next message explains it all.\n\n[Stella]\n\"fuk i woke rosa\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"sry bye <3\"\n\nI'm mortified at the prospect of Rosa finding out about this. I hope Stella can explain it somehow. Or at the very least get the shoe-to-the-face treatment for being a slut and not for...\n\nFor um...\n\nSending nudes to a guy with a girlfriend?\n\nDamn why did I do this?\n\nI'm immediately filled with shame and guilt, eclipsing the horniness from before.\n\nThere is NO WAY I'll be able to explain this shit to Fang anymore. No. She can't know about ANY of this.\n\n...\n\nDick still in hand, I mutely jerk off to the pics Stella sent, and go the fuck to sleep.\n\n* * *\n\nBEEP BEEP BEEP\n\nMy Monday morning alarm pierces the veil of my feverish dreams, being chased by a shotgun wielding Fang.\n\n6 AM.\n\nI feel like shit, and I know that I deserve it.\n\nThe food from yesterday is still on the table. I poke at it a little, but can't get myself to force down a single piece.\n\nI've done something unforgivable.\n\nAnd the worst part? That it's not even over. Oh no.\n\nToday my newest dark secret might be revealed for all the world to know.\n\nBy Rosa? By Stella? Hell, even by me if I slip up.\n\nI can't rationalize why I even did it, besides getting a kick out of it. I love Fang.\n\nI flip through my messages, hoping that it'll turn out to be a dream.\n\nBut no, the entire conversation is there, clear as day.\n\nThis is a nightmare.\n\nI can't even ask anyone for advice...\n\nWell... Maybe I could ask Reed? He's a bro so maybe he'll keep it a secret. Then again, he's Fang's friend first. He might just cut ties with me and tell her.\n\nAnd really, I'd totally deserve it.\n\nStill, it's the best plan I can come up with. That and trying to find Stella alone somewhere, and clear up the situation with her.\n\nIt might be fixable. I'll just have to apologize to Fang, and HOPE that she will understand.\n\n* * *\n\nFortunately Trish is absent today, so I can have a talk with Reed alone during math, our first class of the week.\n\nAlso fortunately I haven't yet run into Fang. Or Stella. Or Rosa.\n\nMy luck can only hold on for so long though, and Reed immediately gets suspicious of my fidgeting around.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Something up, bro?\"\n\n...\n\n[Anon]\n\"Reed um, can you keep a secret?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Hells yeah man, what's up?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Even if it's something really fucked up?\"\n\nHe gets serious all of a sudden.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nI contemplate backing off or lying. But I know Reed enough that he won't have it, not after this intro.\n\n[Anon]\n\"I seriously fucked up man. Like, really-really seriously fucked up. And I don't know what to do.\"\n\nHe expects me to continue.\n\nI don't even know where to begin...\n\n[Anon]\n\"You know Stella won that bet the other day and got me to watch some shit with her?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Uh-huh\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"So we were alone in her room, and she got me onto her bed and--\"\n\nHis eyes widen.\n\n[Reed]\n\"You did not!\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"No. NO! It uh...\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"After the episode she like, kissed me out of fucking nowhere! I bolted the fuck away but...\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"But...\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"But?\"\n\nI can't do it. Jesus Reed, you would never talk to me if you knew...\n\nI take a look around, thankfully nobody is paying us any attention.\n\nI open my mouth to formulate the words, but they're stuck in my throat.\n\n[Anon]\n\"I-- then-- at night--\"\n\nTo my surprise, Reed's troubled face turns to a grin. Although he drops it quickly.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Dude, you did the jenkem to the kiss?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Yeah that's kinda fucked up but like... You just gotta let her down, you know like--\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"It was pictures. She sent pictures. I asked and she sent them.\"\n\nThat shuts Reed right the fuck up.\n\nYeah.\n\n[Reed]\n\"...you serious?\"\n\nMy silence is answer enough.\n\nReed slumps back into his chair. He looks like someone that refuses to believe what he just heard.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Man, that's fucked up. What are you going to do?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Fang doesn't know jack, right?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"She doesn't. Not yet.\"\n\nHe just nods.\n\n[Anon]\n\"I don't know what to do man. I figured that I'll talk to Stella today and get her to back off, but I don't know how to handle the Fang situation.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Help me out here man, please!\"\n\nAt that exact moment, my phone buzzes.\n\nIt's a message from Stella.\n\nI show the notification to Reed for dramatic effect, and he looks back at me with a very fucking intense look.\n\n[Reed]\n\"I can't, Anon. I'll keep this a secret, but Fang is my friend and I won't lie to her.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"I'll hold her off for today so you can handle Stella. But you better fucking explain it to her after.\"\n\nHe sighs, and continues in a softer tone.\n\n[Reed]\n\"You fucked up. Fang might be willing to look the other way, cause you seriously seem like you know that it's fucked. And that you were the one to fuck it into the ground.\"\n\n...\n\nThat's more than I could have hoped for. Thank you based god Reedman.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Thanks dude. I owe you a big one.\"\n\nHe holds his hand up at that.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Nah. You make it up to Fang and we're square, aight? But this is a one time thing, you better believe it.\"\n\nI'm about to respond when the bell goes off. Reed immediately gets up, and leaves me with a you-so-do-not-want-to-fuck-this-up stare.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nI remain in my seat almost throughout the entire period, minimizing the risk of running into Fang.\n\nRight, I should check the message from Stella. Maybe she feels guilty too. Maybe she's realized that this is wrong.\n\n[Stella]\n\"i got called a bad girl Anon\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"am i a bad girl? <3 <3\"\n\nMy mind goes blank, and essentially I do the blinkingguy.gif motion.\n\nNo fuck this. This is my chance. Reed should take care of Fang, so I just need to get to Stella before this all goes belly up.\n\n[Anon]\n\"lunch. roof.\"\n\nThe bell rings again as I type, so I shut the phone and sprint to the next class.\n\nWhich is music, oh no.\n\nI can feel my phone buzz, probably Stella sending her reply.\n\nBy the time I get there, the class has already started.\n\nI look around nervously, scanning the room for Fang.\n\n[Mr. Jingo]\n\"I'm afraid your partner won't be back for a while.\"\n\n[Mr. Jingo]\n\"They're helping Reed with something-something school mascot something-something.\"\n\nTHANK FUCK\n\n[Anon]\n\"O-okay.\"\n\nI'm handed an assignment sheet, and left to my own devices. Really, I don't care one bit.\n\nAs soon as the teacher is back to whatever the fuck he's doing I take my phone out to check the message from Stella.\n\nThere's a couple from Fang too.\n\n[Fang]\n\"soz ditching w\/ reed\"\n\n[Fang]\n\"ill help u after school :V\"\n\nWow. If I wasn't yet feeling shitty, that sure did it.\n\nOkay, let's check the other one.\n\n[Stella]\n\"okie <3\"\n\nPlus there's a closeup of her mouth, doing a blowjob gesture with her hand.\n\nThis fucking bitch.\n\n...\n\nStill hot tho.\n\n* * *\n\nI get onto the roof with conflicted feelings.\n\nWould it be that bad to keep Stella around? That is, if we can keep it a secret? Looks like that's her agenda here.\n\nIf she wanted me and Fang to break up, she's got more than enough leverage on me.\n\nLike okay this is a major fucking red flag, but it's not like I'm hurting Fang...\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure that I'd be able to face myself in the mirror ever again. Fang would surely know that something's up, and then it would be only a matter of time till she figures it out.\n\nPlus there's Reed, who would never let me get away with it.\n\nLet's stick with the original plan.\n\nScanning the surroundings I conclude that I'm alone on the roof. No messages from Stella, so I'm assuming she's on her way.\n\nI assume correctly. In only a minute or two she makes her appearance.\n\nShe's wearing her usual shirt and shorts combo.\n\nPart of me is thankful for that. Makes this all the more normal. Normal-er.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Hey, Anon!\"\n\nI don't respond, but instead grab her by her forearm and forcefully drag her behind the little shed Fang preened on top of that one time.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Geez! Okay!\"\n\nShe janks her arm back. Seems like she's not really sure what to expect.\n\nI take a deep breath. Let's do this.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Stella, this can't continue.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I have a girlfriend, who you know by the way.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I shouldn't have led you on last night either, so I am sorry, okay?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"But please, let's not go any further than this.\"\n\nI can't bring myself to keep eye contact.\n\nThere's total silence for a while.\n\nShe steps closer, causing me to back into the wall.\n\n[Stella]\n\"No further, so... We should keep things as they are?\"\n\nShe grabs onto my belt with both hands, pulling her body close to mine.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Cause I really am your bad bitch now, Anon...\"\n\nI'm speechless.\n\nI want to push her away too, yet I can't find the strength to lift a single finger.\n\n[Anon]\n\"That's not what--\"\n\nI'm cut off by the creaking of the door.\n\nOh no.\n\n[????]\n\"Are you sure this is okay?\"\n\n[????]\n\"Isn't the roof like, off-limits?\"\n\n...is that fucking Naser?\n\n[????]\n\"It'll be fine.\"\n\nYep, and that's Naomi. I could never forget her annoying ass voice.\n\n[Naser]\n\"Shit fine, let's do this...\"\n\nOh god, what are they doing?\n\nA quick check at Stella tells me that she's just as frozen as I am.\n\nI can hear clothes shuffling, and a belt being undone.\n\nNo.\n\nOh god please, please no.\n\nNooooooooooooooooo!\n\nThe unmistakable noise of a blowjob hits my ears.\n\nThis can't be real. I've fainted, and this is just a dream, right? Right?\n\nThe lewd sounds continue for a good minute, and it doesn't sound like they'll be done soon either.\n\nTo my horror, Stella starts whispering into my ear.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Aww Anon, maybe we should do something too?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"No shut the fuck up!\"\n\nMy voice is merely a panicked whisper.\n\nThere are now disturbing fucking throat sounds coming from the other side of the shed.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Mmmm, can you hear how hard Naser is giving it to her? So hot, right?\"\n\nShe's unzipping my pants as she says it, reaching for my dick.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Make me.\"\n\nStella is no longer whispering, getting down on her knees. She's successfully released my dick from my boxer, and is now waiting with an open mouth for me to...\n\nTo...\n\n[Naomi]\n\"Fuck, did you hear that?\"\n\n[Naser]\n\"NahIdidn'thearanything.\"\n\nI can see Stella getting impatient, taking a breath to say something again.\n\nFUCK\n\nI grab the back of her head and force her to take it all. Bitch wants silent, I give her silent. Yeah, talk with a throat full of cock.\n\nShe's surprised, but to her credit she doesn't gag one bit.\n\nI keep her like that, her short snout pressed up against my stomach.\n\nMy whole body is shaking in panic, yet I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel great. With her unable to move her head, instead I can feel her tongue exploring my length.\n\nFrom the other side of the shed the noises have already resumed. Naser really is giving it to Naomi.\n\nBy the sounds of it she's taking it like a champ too.\n\n[Naser]\n\"Ffffuucckkk!\"\n\nI guess that's him finishing. Truth be told, I'm not that far behind.\n\nEven in her current situation, Stella is doing all she can to tip me over. Fucking silently too, thank fuck.\n\nSomewhere inside the building a bell rings, and the other couple quickly leaves.\n\nI'm so relieved that I immediately let go of Stella's hair.\n\nBut she doesn't budge one bit and keeps going.\n\nOh no.\n\nAm I going to...? Will she seriously make me...?\n\nThere's no way I can get away with the wall behind me. D-do I even want to?\n\nI look down at Stella, who's staring right back up at me.\n\nThere are tears running down her blushed cheeks, my dick still embedded deep in her throat. Nothing but the bulge on the outside can be seen of it, mids the strands of saliva almost reaching down to the floor.\n\nFuck.\n\nI grab into her hair, and start to awkwardly move my hips back and forth. Once again, she takes the impromptu facefuck like a pro.\n\nJust who is this girl?\n\nSoon I reach the point of no return. With one last shove, I force the entire thing down into her throat again.\n\nAnd there I go.\n\nStella closes her eyes, taking the load with loud gulping sounds.\n\nAfterwards she backs off, letting my dick pop from her mouth with a lewd slurping sound.\n\nUsing her shirt she cleans up the drool the best she can, humming to herself contently.\n\nMeanwhile, my heart has practically stopped.\n\nWith the climax over, shame and helplessness wash over me double-fold.\n\nMy legs give away, and I slide down beside the wall. Thankfully Stella doesn't cuddle up to me, she keeps her distance kneeling there.\n\nMaybe realizing how far she went, or maybe for seeing how miserable she's made me.\n\nI almost fucking choke up on the spot.\n\nThat's it, my life is fucking over.\n\nU DUN IT NAO ANO MOU\n\nI stay there, legs splayed and softening dick still out.\n\n...\n\n[Stella]\n\"Are you alright, Anon?\"\n\nBitch what do you think?\n\n[Anon]\n\"Yes Stella, how could you tell? This is me being alright.\"\n\nShe doesn't reply, but I can tell that she, too, has noticed the change in the mood.\n\nAfter a few minutes, my non-existent dignity compels me to at least put my dick away.\n\n[Stella]\n\"It's okay.\"\n\nSomething within me snaps. I look her hard in the eye, and shout so loud that I'm sure the entire school will hear.\n\n[Anon]\n\"OH! It's OKAY?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Wow Stella, did you read that from the stars? Or a deck of cards?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Are you such an expert in bitching yourself out from all the hentai doujin that you've read?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Or maybe it's cause you routinely ruin others' lives? Maybe that's got something to do with you having SOOOO many friends, right?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Maybe you should just fucking neck yourself, weeb retard!\"\n\nBy the end I'm seething with anger.\n\nSomewhere deep down I know that I'm just looking for an outlet to vent my spent up feelings.\n\nThat I've gone way, way too far.\n\nMaybe she's done something wrong, but I played along.\n\nHell, I sound like all the run of the mill bullies from my old school.\n\nI want to keep shouting, but I don't even have the strength for that anymore...\n\nMy shoulders drop, and I can just barely keep myself from curling up in fetal position.\n\nI just now notice the hot tears rolling down my face.\n\nBy some miracle, Stella hasn't left yet.\n\nFrom the corner of my eyes I can see her fists shaking, grasping the end of her jeans so hard that her knuckles have turned white.\n\n[Stella]\n\"T-take that back!\"\n\n...\n\n[Stella]\n\"Anon, take it back!\"\n\n...\n\n[Stella]\n\"Please.\"\n\nHer voice is soft. Sounds like she's choking back her tears right now, but won't be able to for long.\n\n...\n\nI feel utterly and completely miserable right now.\n\nSomehow I've managed to piss off or alienate everyone that I know and hold dear in just a few hours.\n\nIf I don't do something, I'll end up alone, again.\n\nFang and Reed can be mad at me for good reason. Hell, I won't even have anything to say if Naser breaks my arms. Or neck.\n\nBut Stella... No, I really did just say some fucked up stuff.\n\nShe might be a huge bitch, but she doesn't deserve this.\n\nI'm reminded of her giddy, pure and genuine excitement for her show yesterday. I can't turn someone like that into a broken cynical dipshit like me.\n\nUnlike everything else, I still have a chance to make this right at least.\n\n[Anon]\n\"...I'm sorry.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I take it all back.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"You're not so bad, Stella.\"\n\nI wipe some of my tears off, not that it really accomplishes anything. She scoots closer, placing a hand on my shoulder.\n\nWe stay like that for a good while, till my sobbing subsides.\n\n[Stella]\n\"So, are you okay now?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"...I guess.\"\n\nShe retreats her hand, coughing a bit.\n\n[Stella]\n\"So um... I'm not stupid, Anon. I know why you called me here.\"\n\nHuh? Where's this coming from all of a sudden?\n\n[Stella]\n\"And I know you're soooo crazy about Fang.\"\n\nSo then... What?\n\n[Stella]\n\"But geez, take a reality check!\"\n\nI... What?\n\n[Stella]\n\"You've known her for what? A month?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"You've been dating for half of that tops. It's not like, you're engaged or whatever.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"So what if you fool around with another girl?\"\n\nI...\n\nWhat she says sort of makes sense but... Fool around?\n\nI'm in a relationship for fucks sake!\n\nMaybe it hasn't been going on for long, but that doesn't give me the right to cheat on my partner.\n\nAnd if she's right, then what's the deal with Reed?\n\nHe KNEW that this shit is fucked. And so did I.\n\n...\n\nWell, I mean...\n\nOkay.\n\nNot counting my socially uneducated ass, now I have two opposing extremes that both make sense in their own way.\n\nWhich one would Fang agree with?\n\nLet's assume that--\n\n[Stella]\n\"Umm, Anon?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Huh?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"You've been like, mumbling for two minutes straight, is everything alright?\"\n\nFucking mumbling.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Uh, yeah...\"\n\nShe fidgets around a bit, apparently unsure what to do with the situation.\n\nTraces of her tears are still visible on her face, though I'm not sure if they from me being a dick or my literal dick.\n\nI don't even know which would make me feel worse anymore.\n\n...\n\nI decide that changing the subject is the best course of action here.\n\n[Anon]\n\"So uhh, like, cards?\"\n\nAt first she doesn't get what I mean - no wonders there -, but somehow she ends up explaining the idea and nuances of tarot cards to me.\n\nThis time I hear out without any insults.\n\nWell, without many insults.\n\nTruth be told if I don't focus in on her weirdness too much, she's not bad.\n\nApparently she puts the same amount of care and innocent ambition into anything she likes.\n\nMakes me wonder if that includes her, um, friendship towards me.\n\n* * *\n\nWe end up ditching the remainder of the class, then say awkward goodbyes when the bell rings. Stella is the last to leave.\n\nThe rest of the classes go on without further incident, leaving me to contemplate my life decisions.\n\nFang messages me a few times, short status reports on what they're doing with Reed. Sounds like he's doing good on his promise and managed to trap Fang for the entire day.\n\nIn a twisted way, it makes me want to laugh.\n\nMy original plan is all but ruins now, and I haven't gotten a single step closer to solving the issue with Fang peacefully.\n\nQuite the opposite.\n\nBut after listening to Stella and spending time with her...\n\nA growing part of me doesn't even want to explain anything to Fang anymore. Like Stella said, we're like...\n\nWho even says that we're in a serious relationship with Fang? We've never announced it as such, and only gone on, like, two dates.\n\nThat's not a relationship, that's literally just dating. Barely. Feeling the waters. So what if I'm seeing another girl?\n\n...\n\nWho am I trying to convince here?\n\nThroughout the rest of the classes, these two contradicting flows of thought keep me in an endless loop.\n\nI've had sex with a girl, while in a relationship.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nIt's at best a week old relationship that I'm obsessing over, and therefore I'm overreacting.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nIf that was the case, why did it upset Reed so much? He's acting like I've committed adultery, so it has to be a serious relationship.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nNot once was it stated that this is a SERIOUS relationship, and therefore I'm overreacting.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nMy initial reaction has to be the correct one, afterall I'm literally half of the relationship at hand and should know my feelings best.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nMy feelings can be just my turboautism acting up after years of nogf, and if I was normal I wouldn't take it this hard. Therefore I'm overreacting.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that I've had sex with a girl, while in a relationship.\n\n...\n\nOn and on it goes. My head feels like an infinity symbol.\n\nAfter an eternity of suffering the final bell rings, symbolizing my freedom to go ahead and fuck my life up even more.\n\nFang said that she'd come over to help with my music assignment, but I don't feel like talking to anyone.\n\nIf it angers Reed then so be it.\n\nI shoot her a quick message, excusing myself. She replies something but I can't be bothered to read it.\n\n* * *\n\nBack in my shitty flat I end up sitting a long time over the now day old tray of leftover dino nuggies.\n\nI leave it untouched again. My stomach protests, but I can't bring myself to eat.\n\nThe best course of action now is to soothe my nerves, to distract myself with something.\n\nShitposting would usually do it, but I don't feel like I could be clever enough to come up with anything good.\n\nRock Ring it is.\n\nThe mindless nature of shootan eventually brings me sweet delirium, and I don't even notice the sun setting.\n\nThe flickering light of the screen is all I need.\n\nAfter what could have been eight or so hours of just zoning out, the events of the day painfully crawl back into my consciousness.\n\nChecking my phone there's a mixture of messages from Fang, Reed, and Stella.\n\nI hate myself for it, but I only want to hear from one of them.\n\nMight as well, I deserve to feel like shit.\n\nMy thumb hovers over Stella's name for a long time before I open the conversation.\n\nOnly one message, fairly recent.\n\n[Stella]\n\"going 2 bed, how u doin?\"\n\nMy first instinct is to respond with \"bad\".\n\nAnd for reals? Yeah. That's what I end up sending to her too.\n\n[Anon]\n\"bad\"\n\nI check the others' messages as I wait for her reply.\n\nReed sent quite a few.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Your classes are over, right?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Bro?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Hey man, I can't keep her here forever\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Bro\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Where are you?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"K she's gone home.\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Did you talk?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"How did it go?\"\n\n[Reed]\n\"Dude what's happening?\"\n\nHe gave up after that.\n\n[Fang]\n\"ye ok i cant come over anyway coz dads a dick\"\n\n[Fang]\n\"ugh im gonna kill reed >:V\"\n\n[Fang]\n\"and naser too\"\n\n[Fang]\n\"how was ur day btw\"\n\nI contemplate sending \"bad\" to her too, but then I'd have to explain.\n\nI'm about to type in some neutral sounding bullshit anyway, but then Stella's reply arrives.\n\nOnce again I'm disgusted by how fast I switch over to her from Fang.\n\nAnd yet there's that unmistakable feeling of excitement in my stomach.\n\n[Stella]\n\"aww!! want me to send something to make u feel better? <3\"\n\nDo I? I don't even know anymore.\n\n[Anon]\n\"how r u feeling\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"hot ;)\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"srsly\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"yeh ;)\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"no i mean seriously how are you\"\n\n...\n\nOh god how long is that reply gonna be?\n\n[Stella]\n\"im rewatching gurren lagann\"\n\nHuh.\n\n[Stella]\n\"do u like it?\"\n\nWow what a pleb.\n\nNo, my tastes is ultimately better cause-\n\nWait.\n\nThat's not what I've asked. Could she be having second thoughts?\n\nKinda late for that.\n\n[Anon]\n\"not what i asked\"\n\nIt takes her even more time to reply.\n\n[Stella]\n\"what did you mean I ruin others lives?\"\n\nOh. That.\n\nWould you look at that, I'm feeling like the waste of society again!\n\n[Anon]\n\"i didnt mean that\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"really?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"yes im sorry\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"but then why dont I have friends Anon?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"why dont I have a boyfriend?\"\n\nI have no answer. I mean, what can I say to her that she doesn't already know?\n\n\"It's because you're so weird.\"\n\nShe has to know that.\n\nPretty sure that I've heard Rosa say that to her.\n\nI'm also sure that I have too, on multiple occasions.\n\nUhhhhhhh...\n\nThis is getting awkward.\n\nSuddenly, she's calling me.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Uh, hey?\"\n\n...\n\nBitch speak up already.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Hey, I'm not bothering you am I?\"\n\nWhat, like for the last 24 hours? Nah.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Nah, don't worry about it.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Um...\"\n\nShe goes silent again, and I can only hear her breathing for a while. Maybe it's my mind playing tricks, but I swear that her breaths have that raspy undertone, like, could she have been crying?\n\nI didn't know it was possible for me to feel worse, but remembering my outburst on the rooftop makes me wish I was six feet under already. I have no idea how she could take that so calmly.\n\nAlthough maybe she didn't, apparently.\n\nBut still, Stella went out of her way to point out that I need a reality check, like she knows how relationships work.\n\nSure, she could have been just bullshitting me so I keep her as a sidepiece, but there seem to be more to this. It's too sudden for her to be all moody and shit after that.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Why can't I have friends, Anon? Why am I such a freak?\"\n\nYeah, my point exactly. Something happened.\n\nHOL UP\n\nRosa definitely would not have a crying Stella within five feet of her. She's not there. Or Stella isn't in the dorms?\n\nMaybe they've had a fight? I should find out somehow.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n[Anon]\n\"Did you have a fight with Rosa?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Uhm, how did you-- Wait, did-- She told you?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Is that why you've messaged me?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"What? No. You've messaged me first, remember?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Oh. Right.\"\n\n...\n\n[Anon]\n\"So what happened?\"\n\nWhy do I care?\n\n[Stella]\n\"I-it wasn't a fight, not really... Um...\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Some of Rosa's friends came over cause they were going out, and Rosa um... She wanted me to come along, but I didn't want to cause I didn't want to ruin their fun, and then Rosa wouldn't let it go, and she said something mean and I got mad and said something mean too, and then they left and I stayed and I feel soooo bad now!\"\n\nShe's talking increasingly faster, but I think I've got the gist of it.\n\nIt honestly doesn't sound that bad, and yet... Rosa said something mean to her? That would be a first.\n\nI mean, her usual go-to is the shoe, so it had to be something fucked up to get Stella this mad over it.\n\nLike more so than me literally telling her to kill herself.\n\nI'm scared to even ask, but I have to know.\n\n[Anon]\n\"W-what did she say?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"She said that if I don't go I'll just waste my life watching anime! Like that's a bad thing!\"\n\nI'm certain that my sigh albeit internal is powerful enough to be picked up on radar, and a few AM radio stations.\n\nThen I realize it.\n\nNo matter how laughable and trivial this sounds, Rosa did just offhand confess to not only not caring for Stella's main area of interest, but actively condemning it. Something that I'd wager she didn't let slip until now.\n\nThat she sees herself better than Stella, who is 'just a weeb'.\n\nConsidering that Rosa is kinda her only friend, I understand how this could leave a deep wound in Stella's heart.\n\nAfterall I am a firsthand witness to how much she cares for her anime.\n\nCringey or not, phase or not, outgrow it she might, for the here and now this is important to Stella, and therefore it's important to me.\n\n...\n\nWhatwasthat?\n\nUh...\n\nIt uh, it's important to Stella. Yes.\n\n...\n\nI should say something.\n\n[Anon]\n\"I see.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"So uh, what did you say to her?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nLong ass fucking silence.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Was it that bad?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Mhm.\"\n\nI can't even imagine. But I guess prying this particular bit isn't helpful.\n\nOkay so, what happens now? I can't make this right or magic up some friends for her. Not to mention that I should keep my distance cause of the whole Fang thing.\n\nThat last part really makes all of this a whole lot more confusing than it needs to be.\n\nI guess now it's my turn to make her feel better by being friendly, supportive, and DEFINITELY not flirty so that she won't take it the wrong way. Just make her know that she matters, nothing more.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Well, if it makes you feel any better I totally jerked off to the pics you sent yesterday.\"\n\n...\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me? Maybe there's a reason why I write drafts before ordering a pizza.\n\nEVASIVE MANEUVERS\n\nDAMAGE CONTROL\n\nDAMAGE CONTROL\n\n[Anon]\n\"Er, I mean, do a tarot card reading for me?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Y-you did?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Let's pretend you didn't hear that?\"\n\nWHAT WAS I THINKING\n\n[Stella]\n\"T-that's kinda hot, Anon...\"\n\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nMORE DAMAGE CONTROL\n\n[Anon]\n\"Haha, I'm just joking!\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"...oh\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"So you didn't like them?\"\n\nOh god I'm sweating fucking oceans here.\n\nMAXIMUM DAMAGE CONTROL MODE ENGAGE\n\n[Anon]\n\"Haha no! Not one bit! Like how could I, right? Haha! They were terrible! Haha!\"\n\nAaaaaaaaaaaand there goes the call.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhat did I say?\n\n...\n\nOh.\n\nOH.\n\nGreat. Now she must think that she's a freak AND that she's ugly.\n\nI try calling her back, but she's not answering. This is not good.\n\nWell, okay, but maybe Rosa will cheer her up, right?\n\nWait.\n\nOh fuck.\n\nOh, fuck me!\n\nI try calling again, still no answer.\n\nMy words from the rooftop echo in my mind.\n\n\"Maybe you should just fucking neck yourself!\"\n\nShe- She's not seriously about to-\n\nRight?\n\nFuck! What's the time?\n\nTwo in the fucking morning.\n\nNo way are there buses at this hour. Maybe I could call a taxi?\n\nNo. I don't want people to know that I'm going to the girls' dorms at night. How could I even explain that to the driver?\n\nBut... Even if I could by some miracle run all the way there, that'd take like at least half an hour. If she's about to- No, that's just too much time.\n\nI try the phone again.\n\n\"Maybe you should just fucking neck yourself!\"\n\nNot only is there no answer, but looks like she turned it off too. That or she blocked me.\n\nOKAY FUCK IT\n\n* * *\n\nAbout an hour later I round the last corner to the dorms. Halfway there my underfed body made it painfully obvious that it's definitely not going to be a half-hour trip.\n\nI'm dripping with sweat and wheezing like a chain smoker. My legs are just about to give out. I swear that I can see dots dancing on the edge of my vision too.\n\nI've tried calling Stella multiple times, to no avail. Even tried Rosa once, but one second after I dropped Stella's name she threw a wall of Spanish curses my way, then hung up. At least I think they were curses.\n\n[Rosa]\n\"An-on? What is up?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Rosa! I think Stella's about to--\"\n\n[Rosa]\n\"Stella? \u00a1Fucking PUTA! \u00a1LA MADRE QUE TE PARI\u00d3!\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"YOU'RE NOT LISTENING SHE'S GONNA FUCKING--\"\n\n[Rosa]\n\"\u00a1STELLA VETE AL CARAJO! \u00a1VETE A TOMAR POR CULO! \u00a1MIERDA!\"\n\nLike that.\n\n...\n\nThere's no commotion outside the building, so at least she's not jumped off the roof or anything dramatic like that.\n\nPeople would have noticed, right?\n\nOne last deep breath, and I'm jogging to the building.\n\nAlmost made it inside too, before someone tackles me.\n\n[????]\n\"Hold your horses boy, where do you think you're going?\"\n\n[????]\n\"We're closed for the night.\"\n\nFuck, I should have known they'd have security.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Dude you gotta let me in, she's-\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"Oh, I'm sure that you'll be able to work this out with your girlfriend. In the morning.\"\n\nWHY THE FUCK IS NO ONE LISTENING\n\n[Anon]\n\"SHE'S ABOUT TO FUCKING KILL HERSELF MAN!\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"YOU HAVE TO LET ME IN!\"\n\nHe's taken aback, but still won't let go of me.\n\n[Guard]\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Stella! Stella is going to fucking neck herself you meteor dodger faggot now let go of me, retard!\"\n\nThe guard looks like he doesn't know whether to break my jaw or throw me into the bushes. Maybe both, in that order.\n\nThis is taking too fucking long. Every second now, she could be...\n\nStill, this asshole drags me into his booth or whatever instead of letting me save her.\n\n[Guard]\n\"You stay the fuck here, I'm going to make an announcement.\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"This better not be a fucking joke, you hear me?\"\n\nHe gives me the dead eyes, as if I fucking cared.\n\n[Guard]\n\"This the weird stego chick you talking about?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Yes, it fucking is. Stella.\"\n\nThe PA system cracks to life, and the guard's voice booms over the empty corridors.\n\n[Guard]\n\"Stella! Come to the entrance immediately!\"\n\nHe repeats it, and I'm left there dumbfounded.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Are you fucking high? She's not gonna come here if she's dead!\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"Watch your fucking mouth, boy. What's your name?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"What? I- My name is Anon Mous.\"\n\nHe returns to the PA one more time.\n\n[Guard]\n\"Stella, come to the entrance. Anon is here for you.\"\n\nMy heart skips a beat.\n\nOh, that's just great. Now the whole school will know that I visited the girls' dorms late at night. Stella, specifically.\n\nI can just about imagine the rumor mill.\n\n...\n\nI'm getting increasingly nervous as we wait. Thankfully we have view of the shitty cameras, and eventually a Stella-shaped blob shows up on one of them.\n\nTremendous weights lift off my shoulder, and I almost tear up.\n\nShe's okay. She's alive.\n\nThank fuck! I don't even care if I'm getting arrested now.\n\nWe watch her make her way to the gate in silence. A dozen doors open all over the place, but nobody stops her.\n\nOnce she gets close enough the guard gets up to meet her. I'm practically on his heels.\n\nAs soon as Stella is through the doors I rush up to her, embracing her in a tight hug.\n\n[Stella]\n\"A-Anon? What's going on?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Oh god, oh fuck you're alright! You're alright!\"\n\nShe doesn't really know how to respond, and I don't fault her for that.\n\nI can feel her awkwardly returning the hug, but the guard soon breaks it up.\n\n[Guard]\n\"Okay boy, you mind telling me what's all this about?\"\n\nUh.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Um... I was wrong?\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"Yeah. No shit.\"\n\nHe looks at his watch, then sighs.\n\n[Guard]\n\"Here's what's going to happen.\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"I'm going to write a detailed report of how a certain Anon Mous caused a serious disturbance here, late at night. You can bet this is going to have consequences.\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"While I do that you two take whatever the fuck this is up to her room. But no funny business, or so help me I will make you a sex offender in that report.\"\n\n[Guard]\n\"Am I clear here?\"\n\n...\n\n[Guard]\n\"Go. Now.\"\n\n* * *\n\nWith that, we make our walk of shame up to her room. The stares of the lingering strands of students practically drill holes through us.\n\nI'm sure that half of the school already knows, and the rest will know come morning.\n\nIncluding Fang.\n\nI don't know if I'm making another mistake here or not, but I decide that turning my phone off is the smart thing to do.\n\nNeither of us speaks up until she's locked the door behind us. Actually, not even after.\n\nThe room is not how I remembered it.\n\nIt wasn't tidy the last time either, but now it has shit thrown around everywhere. More clothes, books, cards, linen from both beds. I can even see the side of a laptop jutting out from under a cupboard at an angle that surely isn't within the bounds of \"intended use\". The desks too, have almost all of their shelves pulled out and thrown about.\n\nA total battlefield. Makes me wonder if this is the result of her fight with Rosa, or if it happened after.\n\nWe sit down on the remains of Rosa's bed.\n\nStella looks awkward and unsure. Like a doe in the headlights. Her hair, her mascara, it's all messed up too. In other circumstances, it would be kinda hot.\n\nThis has got to be about her worst day ever.\n\nI can't help but notice her cute pajamas though. The best way I can describe them is \"girly\". Like seriously what a six-year-old would wear, complete with a mosaic pattern of teddy bears.\n\nI'm so lost in examination that I almost miss her soft voice.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Anon, what is going on? Why are you here?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"I, like, when the call- And then when I and the Rosa then, so- And I'm here.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"W-what?\"\n\nRight, let's try that again.\n\n[Anon]\n\"When you hung up I uh, I remembered how I shouted at you on the roof, and that you're fucked up now, and that Rosa won't be here, and I thought that you'd, like, want to and so then I here but the dude, like, the guard dude wouldn't, and then--\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Anon stop! You're not making sense again.\"\n\nAhhh come onnnn!\n\nI take a deep breath to give it another go, but she stops me.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I... Got it.\"\n\nShe looks away, embarrassed.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\nHuh? What's she talking about?\n\n[Anon]\n\"What? But I'm the one that fucked up everything.\"\n\n...\n\n[Stella]\n\"No Anon, you're not. If it wasn't for me, you would be at home happily sleeping. Hell, maybe you'd be with Fang right now.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"It's like you said, all I do is ruin others' lives.\"\n\nI want to protest, but she covers my mouth with a hand.\n\nGuess after my eloquent speech it's her turn now.\n\n[Stella]\n\"You were right that I shouldn't have... I shouldn't have kissed you and- And I shouldn't have done any of the things that I did.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"But I was so happy that I've finally found someone that doesn't think anime is just a waste of time.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"And... I knew that you're with Fang, but I was so caught up with the idea of finally having a boyfriend that I could talk to, and who would care for stuff I care about, that I just...\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"And then that night you messaged me, and I was so happy about it!\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"...but then all that stuff you said on the roof...\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"And I know you took it back, but I knew that you were right. Nobody wants to be my friend, not for real. Even with you, I was...\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"I'm just such a homewrecker...\"\n\nI desperately want to interject before she gets to the murder-suicide part.\n\n[Stella]\n\"But... You still wouldn't want me to go... And you're here now too... And I...\"\n\nShe starts shuffling around, slowly inching her way to me.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I...\"\n\nI can't help but sit there, frozen to the core as her slender fingers make way for her strawberry flavored lips.\n\nThe kiss, same as the last one, starts slow and awkward. But whereas she pulled away last time, this time she doubles down.\n\nI can feel a dexterous tongue slither into my mouth, and any resistance I might have had melts right away.\n\nEvery fiber, every atom of my body knows how wrong this is. But I couldn't care less.\n\nOur hands find eachother, fingers intertwining.\n\nI lay back on the bed and Stella gets on top of me. The kiss breaks merely so we can take a breather. Her hot breath is driving me crazy.\n\nI look into her eyes, and she looks back at me. We both know that we should stop. Hell, that we shouldn't have done any of this to begin with. But our lives are forfeit already.\n\nNot a second passes and we're connected again, silently confirming that there are no breaks on this train. Not anymore.\n\nOur hands drift apart and start to explore all the fun new places.\n\nHer scales are smooth but hot against my palm. It doesn't take me long to figure out that she's not wearing a bra right now.\n\nHeh. Titties.\n\nI've never had one in my hand before. It feels so nice and warm. Plump, but with the right amount of perkiness.\n\nMeanwhile, Stella has settled into kind of a missionary position. Or like, reverse missionary. What's it called with the guy on the bottom?\n\nAnyway, she's grinding up a storm against my jeans hiding one diamond of a dick.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Anon... I want it... I want you.\"\n\nOh fuck, that's fucking hot.\n\nWe're locked in another kiss, only awkwardly breaking it up so I can take her shirt off.\n\nIt would have been nice to have a look at her like that, but feeling her bare breasts press up against my chest is its own reward.\n\nBut uh, we should get on the undressing me situation, I guess. How complicated can sex be? Lots of people have it, I'm told.\n\n[Anon]\n\"C-could you um...?\"\n\nI motion for her to move so I can take off my shirt.\n\nShe tries, but we don't really manage it. I just can't do it while laying down like this.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Maybe we should...\"\n\nShe gets off of me, and FINALLY I get a good look at her boobs.\n\n...\n\nShe has two of them.\n\nThey're green.\n\nThe right one points to the side a little.\n\n[Anon]\n\"You're beautiful.\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"Get naked already! Geez!\"\n\nThe contrast between her nervous fidgeting against the top-slut-tier blowjob on the roof is day and night. I don't really get what's the difference, but I don't mind.\n\nMaybe that was bad bitch Stella, and this is the real Stella?\n\nIn any case, we both undress. Separately. It's awkward, to say the least.\n\nBut damn, being naked with a girl is way too exciting. Our faces are so red that you'd think we just ran a marathon.\n\nWell, I kinda did.\n\nStella returns to me, dropping her panties just before straddling me again. Her body feels incredibly warm, and the sensation of the tip of her scales ever so slightly biting into my skin is an exciting, alien one.\n\nIn return my naked dick pokes at her soft thighs. There's an unmistakable moisture covering them.\n\nWe lay back again, joined in a slow but passionate kiss.\n\nShe reaches for my dick, but her hand jolts back as soon as she touches it. Once, twice...\n\nIn the end, I grab her hand and forcibly wrap her fingers around it. Her breath shortens, and every muscle in her body tenses up.\n\nIt doesn't last more than a second though, and soon she's lining herself up for... Up for...\n\nNow it's my body that stiffens, the tip touching her puffy lips. For a fraction of a moment, the sane part of my mind wonders how we've got here. But it's quickly overruled.\n\n[Stella]\n\"A-Anon, I'm g-going to... Okay?\"\n\nI nod, moving my hands to her waist in encouragement.\n\nInstinctively I hold my breath, and I can see her doing the same. Slowly, ever so slowly she descends. I have no idea how to describe the feeling other than \"warm\".\n\nLines from various doujins and smuts flood my mind, like \"velvety insides\" and \"so hot I'm melting\". I feel kinda let down, cause it just feels wet and warm, but it's not like I've expected those to be documentaries.\n\nAlthough as she gets more and more down- It's getting- Yeah it- Oh. Oh, it- Wow.\n\nOhfuckmethisfeelsamazing.\n\nMy grip tightens around her, which prompts her to stop with a surprised yelp.\n\n[Stella]\n\"A-are you okay? I-is this okay?\"\n\nHer face is so red that I'm like legit afraid for her brain.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Y-yeah. Is it okay for you?\"\n\nShe just nods, but doesn't go any lower.\n\nI pull her into another kiss, and we settle into a lustful yet awkward rhythm. It's apparent that neither of us has any experience whatsoever.\n\nOur movement evens out as we get into it, and I risk going in all the way too.\n\nIt might have been a hasty decision.\n\nStella stops, wincing painfully.\n\n[Stella]\n\"A-ah... Fuck...\"\n\nI try backing away, panicked, but she keeps me pinned down. And then I feel it.\n\nAt first I just feel that something weird is going on down there, like it just got warmer and wetter. I have a pretty good guess, and looking there... Yep. Blood.\n\nOh shit. I didn't even consider that she was a virgin like me. Not after that blowjob.\n\nI want to apologize, but somehow I feel like that'd make it worse.\n\nThere are tears in her eyes now, and she's still trying to gulp the pain down. But... She's not looking, like, sad about it.\n\nIn fact, despite her obvious discomfort she gives me a bright, almost grateful smile. She slows to a halt, running her fingers along my face. In return, I hug her tight - but like, trying to not make her hurt more.\n\nHer disheveld hair sticks to her face on several spots, mascara running all over the place. Her eyes are still red from crying, though the rest of her face matches in color now.\n\nNothing short of an absolute mess.\n\nStill, in that moment, I feel closer to her than to anyone else in a very, very long time. I- I'm not even sure what to think about that. But I do know that I don't want to think about it. Not now.\n\nRight now, I'm...\n\nHappy?\n\nYeah... Yeah, definitely! I'm happy to have made her happy. Even in an idiotic manner like this.\n\nNo. It's not even idiotic.\n\nPushing in all the way like in the pornos? Okay, that was dumb. But taking her virginity? No. I'm not regretting that, and I never will. Relationship drama can go to hell!\n\nI can't even comprehend what it must mean for her. She's given her everything to me, and I'm happy for it. I'm accepting HER, the weird occult-shit-loving tarot-card-reading astrology-believer weeb stego that she is.\n\nCan't help but smile at that, like she is.\n\nBesides, I've practially already given my life up for her.\n\nWe're just a couple of idiots, admitting it to eachother. Nothing in our lives is more important than the other, not in the here and now.\n\nI know that blurting out \"I love you\" would probably ruin everything and even more, but I'm not far from it.\n\nSadly, the moment doesn't last forever.\n\nHer smile drops, rugged breahts testament of the prolonged pain she's enduring. Must be uh, a good pain, I guess.\n\nWe stay like that for a bit, in the end she collapses onto me. There's a pitiful attempt on her part to bounce up and down, but she can't keep that up for more than a few seconds.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Um... Could we um... Switch places?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"W-we can stop if--\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"No, I... I don't want to stop.\"\n\nShe gives me a peck on the lips, then gets up. Her stiff, jerky movements show that she's still obviously in pain.\n\nMakes me feel like an asshole. But I guess that's just how it works?\n\nThis time she lays down, and I get on top of her. We start going at it again, but her face contorts in pain right from the getgo.\n\nWe try kissing to distract her, but it's not working.\n\nAfter about a minute or so she gently pushes me away, and excuses herself to the bathroom. Wow. I hope I didn't seriously fuck something up.\n\nI try not to overthink the situation as I wait for her. Instead, I wipe myself off from the various body fluids and put my boxers back on.\n\nA few minutes later she returns. With panties on.\n\nShe sits down next to me, avoiding eye contact. She looks extremely sad.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I'm sorry that I fucked this up too.\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Hey, it's okay. I'm sorry too, I wasn't thinking.\"\n\nI pull her into a hug and we lay back, cuddling.\n\nWe stay like that for a while, enjoying the other's company.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Did you at least enjoy it?\"\n\n[Anon]\n\"Yeah, you?\"\n\nStupid question.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Um... Yes.\"\n\nHuh.\n\nMore silence.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Aren't you going to regret it?\"\n\n...\n\n[Anon]\n\"That's tomorrow talk, okay?\"\n\n[Stella]\n\"...okay...\"\n\nShe's not convinced, but I guess part of her appreciates the gesture.\n\nI pull her close, cradling her head under mine. No more words.\n\nI don't know how long after, we drift to sleep.\n\n* * *\n\nI wake in a strange bed, in a strange place, beside another person.\n\nIt takes me a few seconds to recollect the events that have transpired, and when I do, I'm filled with nothing but dread.\n\nWell, that's not quite right. There is a persistent rebellion lighting up inside my soul, unwilling to take the blame anymore.\n\nWith the feeling of Stella's warm body in my arms, and the harsh coldness of my crimes in my head, I am no longer able to tell right from wrong.\n\nWas it wrong of me to cheat on Fang? It was, and I cannot - I will not - hold anyone else responsible for that.\n\nWas it right of me to come to Stella in her time of need? It was, who else could have done it? Hell, who else WOULD have done it?\n\nEven if her life wasn't ultimately in danger, with all of her friends gone and all of her pride crumbled to dust, she was about to go down a very dangerous road. I will never-ever be ashamed of stepping out of the mass of apathy, stopping a disaster before it could take hold.\n\nNot after what I've had to live through in the past. Even if it will cost suffering of my own.\n\nIt might have been the only truly right thing that I've done in my life, the one that really mattered.\n\nI strengthen my hold on Stella. I don't want to let her go.\n\n...still, I know that I've done things that are unforgivable under any circumstance. I've had ample opportunities to come clear with Fang, yet I didn't. I couldn't trust her to know the truth, and I couldn't share the burden.\n\nFor a second I entertain the thought that I was sparing her the pain, but it's such an obvious lie that I push it away immediately.\n\nNo. I, and only I, am responsible for deciding to go through this alone. I might have asked Reed's help, but I've ultimately let him down too.\n\nMy hands curl into fists, and I'm unsure if it's from anger or disgust. Maybe both? Resentment.\n\nI resent the fact that after coming such a long way, I am still the same cynical untrusting retard that's afraid to let anyone close in things that actually matter. The act of helping someone with her homework, or playing the guitar with her... These pale in comparison to my unquestioned willingness to STILL consider each fight a fight of my own.\n\nThat I cannot turn the \"me\" to \"us\" in the phrase: \"Me against the word\".\n\nThis cannot continue.\n\nBefore I could further the thought, a set of heavy fists bang away at the door.\n\nKNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\n\n[????]\n\"What's going on in there?\"\n\nI jolt upright, causing Stella to wake as well.\n\nThe voice definitely belongs to one very pissed-off Rosa.\n\nFUCK\n\n[Rosa]\n\"Stella, open the door!\"\n\nFUCK FUCK FUCK\n\nWe look at one another in sheer terror, the same thought flashing through both of our minds.\n\nGET FUCKING DRESSED\n\nStumbling out of the bed - Rosa's bed by the way - we try gathering up our respective articles of clothing.\n\nShe puts on her bra, I put on my sock, she puts on her pants. With a mismatched sock in my hand, I get Stella's attention.\n\nShe motions that yes it's fucking hers, and to help her with it.\n\nI try, but with her leg moving all around, it's not an easy operation.\n\nTo make it all worse, I can hear a key slipping into the lock.\n\nOH THAT'S IT\n\nWE'RE DEAD\n\nI'M DEAD\n\nGoing by my luck, she might as well have Fang in tow. The police too, ready to register me as an offender. Then it truly would be the end of the line.\n\nWe freeze, my hand still grabbing her leg, awaiting the inevitable.\n\n...\n\nNothing happens.\n\nSounds of commotion come from the other side of the door, and another familiar voice joins the fray.\n\n[????]\n\"Rosa! Hey Rosa, wait!\"\n\nI- I refuse to believe it. Is- is that Reed? What's he doing here? After all that I've done, he- is he...?\n\n[Reed]\n\"Don't go in!\"\n\n[Rosa]\n\"Why wouldn't I do that, pendejo?\"\n\n...\n\n[Reed]\n\"Cause uh, it's a hotbox.\"\n\n[Rosa]\n\"Hot box? What is that?\"\n\nFirst I have no idea what Reed is talking about, but then it hits me square in the chest.\n\nIt's a distraction! He knows I'm here and it's a fucking distraction!\n\nI shake off the shock and return to dressing Stella. On comes her shirt, backwards but I don't care, then another sock.\n\nWait, is that different from the other?\n\nNO MATTER\n\nNO TIME\n\nFragments of the outside conversation hit my ears, along the lines of \"can't let the smoke out or Stella's gonna get banned from the dorms\", but Rosa isn't taking the bait anymore.\n\nIn midst of putting my shirt on, the door opens.\n\nRosa looks at me, then Stella, then around the room, then at Stella again, but in the end her eyes lock onto me.\n\nIt takes her a second to register all of the information. Her eyes fill with what I assume to be rage. But before she could do anything, Reed acts first.\n\nTo my disbelief he puts Rosa into a very familiar chokehold from behind, trying to avert her gaze.\n\nToo little too late though, and he's overpowered in a matter of seconds, sent flying back into the hallway.\n\n[Rosa]\n\"An-on, what is happening here? Why are you taking your clothes off?\"\n\nI, wait, off?\n\nOh god, she thinks that we were about to fuck.\n\nI want to speak up, but my tongue is just as frozen as the rest of my body. Thankfully, Stella does.\n\n[Stella]\n\"This isn't what it looks like!\"\n\nCould have been less of a clich\u00e9, but that's essentially true. I finish putting my shirt on, but can't otherwise add anything to the situation.\n\nReed crawls back in through the door too, clutching onto his ribcage.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Geez Rosa, I think you broke my ribs...\"\n\nHe, too, looks around and at us, his expression unreadable. Though he does give me one stare of pity and disbelief, which hits me pretty bad.\n\nRosa pays her little attention though, eyeing daggers at Stella and me. She's handling the current development shockingly well considering that, well, she is Rosa. Maybe she remembers my call from last night.\n\nShe closes the door, sealing the four of us in.\n\n[Reed]\n\"Dude, out the truth now. Fang's on her way here!\"\n\n[Rosa]\n\"I would also like an explanation.\"\n\nTheir words are simple, and their words are just.\n\nAnd yet all they do is evoke that ever-growing rebellion inside me. A dam can only hold so much water.\n\nI give one last weary sigh, then with determination in my eyes I speak, addressing both Rosa and Reed.\n\n[Anon]\n\"Sit down, the both of you.\"\n\nWhat follows is my recollection of the past 32 hours.\n\nI tell them about the bet and the wager. I tell them about watching SAO together, and that kiss. I tell them how confused and damned I've felt about it, and I tell them how I couldn't stop myself from messaging Stella that night.\n\nI tell them about what happened, and the guilt I've felt over it. I tell about my sharing the secret with Reed, turning him into my accomplice, and I tell the shame of the rooftop encounter.\n\nI tell about my doubts, and I tell about my turmoil.\n\nI tell it all, and I tell it true.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the events of last night, I hesitate. Stella, who's been mostly silent up to this point, in a rare feat of courage stands up. She takes my hand and continues the story from her point of view.\n\nShe turns to Rosa, apologizing for what she said and claiming that it was both because of her pent-up feelings and because of what I've said, but also because she was done with people looking down on her for her unconventional interests.\n\nStella then details that for years now she's been feeling like an outcast, that she's had no real relationships with anyone - friendship or more.\n\nShe knew that what she did was wrong, and yet she couldn't let it go. That yes, she was looking for a boyfriend, any boyfriend, but that it wasn't the case anymore.\n\nThe sex part ends up being omitted, although Stella ends her speech with a thought that very well could have been said by me too.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I have no excuses, but I won't say that all I did was wrong.\"\n\nThe other duo takes our words in a mute stupor. They look at eachother, and then back to us. Nobody breaks the silence.\n\nIt lingers between us for a good while, until another set of knocks can be heard from the door. They're a lot softer this time around, and I have a pretty good guess who they might belong to.\n\nAn icy hand claws into my guts. With my emotions spent, all that remains is the guilt.\n\nRosa walks to the door, opening it without a word.\n\nOn the other side stood none other than Fang, in a way that I've never seen her. Unsure. Tentative.\n\nShe was clutching onto one of her arms, looking in our direction meekly, but more so at the floor.\n\nThere's no need for questions, she's obviously heard our confession.\n\nShe walks in, Rosa closing the door behind her as if it was an omen. Nailing the coffin shut.\n\nFang stands before me, finally finding it in herself to look me in the eye. There are no tears, but her gaze screams pain.\n\nShe feels betrayed, and rightly so. I was the one she could put her faith, her trust in, and I've gone ahead to throw it away brazenly.\n\nThere are no words between us. She doesn't ask me if this is a joke, or if I've even loved her at all. She doesn't blame me, she doesn't shout at me.\n\nTo her, I'm now just a part of the painful past, yet another object trophy to remind her never to trust anyone again.\n\nWhatever justification I've had towards the fling with Stella, none of that seems to matter now. Even if I did save one life, I've ended another. I've picked her up, and let her down. In the worst way possible.\n\nI want to apologize, but it seems all so pointless now. \"Hey, I've shot your dog but you can keep it.\"\n\nI don't imagine there's any combination of words in the English language that would help the situation. Though I'd be more than willing to speak them, for Fang's sake.\n\nA few seconds later she turns to Stella, whose hand I'm still holding onto.\n\nThere's a wordless back and forth between them, one that I cannot fathom to comprehend. Who could Stella be looking at really? Fang or Lucy? And who does Fang see, a freak of a homewrecker, or another soul to save? Her expression is unchanging. Still. Stoic. Save for the pain in her eyes.\n\nStella on the other hand is fidgeting around nervously, on the verge of tears, but not willing to back down.\n\nIt must be hard for her. If I somehow manage to save myself and stay with Fang, Stella loses everything. She won't just be a weird loner anymore, she'll be condemned for possibly her whole life. But if she wins me over, we're a horrible couple of cheaters. Not that we aren't regardless.\n\nFang's silent inspection continues for a bit, ending with a ragged sigh.\n\nShe turns away from us, sitting down on a more or less empty chair, away from the rest of us. Looking at the floor once again, cradling her hands in her lap.\n\nHer voice is soft, barely audible. It breaks my heart to see her like this.\n\n[Fang]\n\"I knew something might be up...\"\n\nShe turns to Reed.\n\n[Fang]\n\"Yesterday, when you kept me from classes. I knew something had to happen cause you'd never put that much effort into one single thing otherwise.\"\n\nHe looks away embarrassed. Reed probably didn't consider that he'd be the one to raise suspicion in Fang. I don't blame him one bit though, he was more than helpful.\n\nAlthough that might even make it worse for him, that he choose to side with a confessed cheater and liar rather than his friend. And that it was all for nothing.\n\nI feel a pang of pride that my girlfriend is so sharp and clever, but it turns to a spike of pain rather quickly. I cannot claim to be her boyfriend anymore. Not even her friend, probably.\n\n[Fang]\n\"...but I never would have thought...\"\n\n...\n\nHer next words address Stella.\n\n[Fang]\n\"Is it true what you said, do you really need Anon? Do you love HIM?\"\n\nAll of our eyes widen at the questions. S-she's-\n\nStella, no longer able to compose herself falls back on the bed.\n\nShe buries her face in her hands, rocking back and forth. Her tail, usually wrapped around her leg, is flopping beside her as if all power left it.\n\nStill hidden behind her cover, she speaks up in barely more than a whisper.\n\n[Stella]\n\"I do.\"\n\nSilence falls upon the room again as Fang processes her words. I can't bring myself to look at her anymore. I close my eyes, shutting the world out.\n\nAll of my guilt, all of my fears, all of my sins culminate in this moment, laid bare for the judgment of one.\n\nI hear her chair creak, footsteps closing to us. I can only surmise that Fang's coming to deck me in the jaw or break my legs. If that's the case, I will not resist.\n\nInstead, I feel a familiar set of arms wrap around me, followed by a pair of feathery wings. I open my eyes, but all I can see are a few strands of silvery hair as she nuzzles her face against mine.\n\nShe hugs me tightly, whispering into my ear.\n\n[Fang]\n\"Then this is goodbye, Anon. Thank you for caring about me... Till you did...\"\n\nI can't muster a response, my insides twisting up painfully.\n\nShe lets me go and moves to Stella.\n\n[Fang]\n\"He can be a big retard, but please take care of him.\"\n\n[Fang]\n\"And if you don't, so help me...\"\n\nStella, frozen much of the same as me, can barely produce a nod.\n\nWith that, Fang takes not another moment, leaving without a further thought spared on our miserable company.\n\nNobody speaks another word either.\n\nEventually, Reed leaves too, followed by a confused Rosa. She looks back as if she wants to say something, but decides not to.\n\nThe door is now closed.\n\n* * *\n\nA few days have passed since that day. The shame and pain remain, but things have returned to more or less their usual rhythm.\n\nStella and I stayed together, while Fang and Reed rather keep their distance from us. I don't blame them one bit.\n\nNaser, when he learned what I did threaten to beat me up, and it took all of Fang's pleading to stop him. Seems like he's taking her unspoken promise seriously, and respecting our decision.\n\nIt makes me feel terrible.\n\nThe only joy I can find is during the time I spend with Stella, and even then, things are awkward to say the least.\n\nSlowly though we seem to be falling into the bounds of a normal-ish relationship.\n\nIt seemed wise for us to take our lunches away from anyone we know, so we ended up on the rooftop.\n\nOn one such occasion, Fang came to meet us.\n\nIt was merely a reminder that she's keeping her eye on Stella, expecting her to do good on her end, and that she'll once again be willing to help me with my music assignments, was I ready to ask.\n\nI thanked her for it, but I'm unsure if I'll ever be ready to ask.\n\nSo much for the goth ptero gf.","Title":"Bad Bitch Stella Classic","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Naser, Reed, Naomi, Rosa, Stella and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Examanon","Summary":"Stella gets Anon to watch anime with her.

What starts out as an innocent hangout between fellow weebs quickly turns into something more...  This is the Alternate sex scene between Anon and Stella, written first before it was revised in favor of more emotion.\n\n\nDO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE MADE IT TO CHAPTER 3!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe kiss, same as the last one, starts slow and awkward. But whereas Stella pulled away last time, this time she doubles down. I can feel a dexterous tongue slither into my mouth, and any resistance I might have had melted right away. Every fiber, every atom of my body, knows how wrong this is. But I don\u2019t care anymore. At that moment, Stella and I were one and the same.\n   Our hands find each other, and our fingers intertwine. I lay back on the bed, and Stella gets on top of me. The kiss breaks merely so we can get some oxygen. Her hot breath is driving me crazy in a way that I have never experienced in my life. I look into her eyes, and she looks back at me. We both know that we should stop. Hell, that we shouldn't have done any of this, to begin with. But our lives are forfeit already. Soon, the whole school will know of our forbidden relationship. Soon, we will both become social pariahs with no one but each other for company. Our future couldn\u2019t look bleaker, yet as we stared into each other\u2019s eyes, we came to the realization that as long as we had each other, the rest of the world could go fuck itself. \n   Not a second passes, and we've connected again, silently confirming that there are no breaks on this train. Not anymore. Our hands drift apart and start to explore all the fun new places. Stella\u2019s scales are smooth to the touch and radiate heat, and once and for all confirming to me that dinos are warm-blooded. It doesn't take me long to figure out that she's not wearing a bra as my hand slowly travels up Stella\u2019s chest, upon which I feel a lump of scaled flesh waiting and eager to be caressed. The sensation is difficult to describe. It feels so lovely and warm. Plump, but with the right amount of perkiness. \n   Meanwhile, Stella has settled into a kind of a missionary position. Or reverse missionary. As I continue kissing her and caressing her breast, she starts grinding up a storm against my jeans. My already hard dick only grows harder until my pants start feeling like they are prisons for my manhood. Yet, rather than causing her to slow, the feeling of my dick rubbing against her womanhood drives Stella further and further into lust. It isn't long until her entire nether regions become wet, which shows me that she also didn't have any panties.\n   With one final twist of her tongue, Stella breaks our kiss and fixes me with a look of barely restrained lust. \u201cAnon... I want it... I want you!\u201d\n   Oh, sweet merciful Raptor Jesus. That's fucking hot!\n   She again swoops down to kiss me, only this one feels deeper than the last. Her tongue once more overpowers mine as she assumes direct control over me in such a way that I cannot\u2014and will not\u2014dispute. The muscles that make up her tongue flick around inside of my mouth as I rub against its underside with my own, reflexively suckling on the invading limb. I\u2019m absolutely shocked at how much longer her tongue's compared to mine as it not only dances whole musical numbers around mine, but does so in such a way that I don\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m getting a raw deal out of it. By this point, she has taken control, and I\u2019m tagging along for the ride of my life.\n   Stella suddenly breaks the kiss and glances down at her shirt. Without a word and with an understanding that I can only describe as instinctual, I grab the bottom of her shirt and pull it over her head. Meanwhile, she also holds the bottom of my shirt and janks it right over my head in one single move. We both toss our discarded shirts aside in unison. Before I get a chance to admire her now revealed abdomen, Stella is once more sucking on my face in an attempt to eat me. It would have been nice to have a look at her now exposed breasts, but feeling the tips of her tits pressing and rubbing against my naked chest is its own reward. \n   Why should I be the only one enjoying myself?\n   Slowly, I drag my hand down Stella\u2019s back, careful to navigate around her backplates. I run my hand over Stella\u2019s shapely hips and ass as I slip my hand inside her pajama pants, little by little making my way towards her womanhood. The closer I get, the wetter and warmer it feels. It doesn\u2019t take more than a few seconds before my hand reaches Stella\u2019s second pair of lips, ones that feel far too eager to be pleased.\n   \u201cAnon\u2026 whaaa\u2014!\u201d Stella moans through our kiss, but she cuts herself off as I slip two fingers into her pussy. That causes her whole body to quake as she breaks off from our kiss to utter a plaint of pleasurable ecstasy. Taking advantage of the sudden momentum, I gently yet persistently stroke her pussy in a circle. Every turn I make sends more shivers through her body as she literally melts in my arms, her eyes glazing over in pleasure, her tongue hanging like a thirsty bitch in heat. Or, in this case, like a beautiful stego in estrus.\n   Stella takes a deep breath and fixes me with a savage lustful expression. Her very eyes seem to suddenly shine with something I can only describe as raw sexual energy as she pins me down on the bed. \u201cOmae wa mo shinde iru!\u201d she exclaims with what I swear are shining eyes.\n   \u201cNa-nani!\u201d I reflexively reply. Not a second passes after I finish my words that Stella grabs hold of my pants and janks them off, my boxes going along with them. In the instant that I blink, Stella has somehow managed to remove her own pants as well, leaving her fully exposed.\n   The contrast between her previous nervous fidgeting and insecurities against the lustful and dominating sex animal before me is day and night. Yet despite that, It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dealing with an impostor or some kind of split personality. Instead, it feels like I see Stella\u2014the REAL Stella\u2014for the first time in my life. No more hiding behind garments or fake emotions. No more pretending to be something she isn\u2019t. At that moment that I gaze upon her natural form, I can\u2019t help but form a single sentence: \u201cYou're beautiful...\u201d\n   For one second, Stella\u2019s animalistic lust gives way to those beautiful light-blue eyes of hers. There's unmistakable moisture covering them. They fog up as her cheeks turn a pretty shade of pink. It isn\u2019t long before her primal urges return again, but they don\u2019t fully take over as she falls upon me and once more begins kissing me deeply. Her body, all of a sudden, feels warmer than before, the sensation of the tip of her scales ever so slightly biting into my skin an exciting, alien one. In return, my naked dick pokes at her soft thighs.\n   Before my brain can register it, I feel something grasping for my dick. I glance down to my thigh and see Stella\u2019s hand wrapped around my soldier. Her breath shortens, and every muscle in her body tenses up. It doesn't last more than a second, though, and soon she's lining my dick up with her pussy.\n   Now it's my body that stiffens, the tip touching the puffy, eager lips of her womanhood. For a fraction of a moment, the sane part of my mind wonders how Stella and I got to where we now are. What choices led two barely functional weebs to a night of unrestrained passion before the shitstorm of their own making?\n   Whatever the reason, it wasn't important anymore. The only thing matters now is accepting the feelings we have for one another and finishing this dance once and for all...\n   Wordlessly, I move my hands to Stella\u2019s hip for encouragement. She gives me one last look of hesitation, almost as if her own brain is running through the very same thoughts I had finished putting aside. I only stretch up and plant a kiss on her lips as a sign of encouragement.\n   Instinctively I hold my breath. Stella does the same. Slowly, ever so slowly, she descends. Little by little, my dick enters her pussy. Stella raises her head up to the heavens as she lets out a slow and steady moan.\n   Meanwhile, I have no idea how to describe the sensation surrounding my little soldier other than \u2018warm.\u2019 Lines from various doujins and smuts flood my mind. Terms like \u2018velvety insides\u2019 and \u2018so hot I'm melting.\u2019 I feel kinda let down; it feels wet and warm, but it's not like I've expected those to be documentaries. Although as she pushes my dick deeper and deeper, it really starts\u2014\n   Yeah, it\u2014\n   Oh. \n   Oh, it\u2014\n   WOW!\n   \u201cOhfuckmethisfeelsamazing!\u201d I shout at the top of my lungs as my grip tightens around Stella\u2019s hips, which prompts her to stop with a surprised yelp.\n   \u201cA-are you okay? I-is this okay?!\u201d she asks, her face so flushed that I'm legit afraid for her brain.\n   \u201cY-yeah. Is it okay for you?\u201d I ask despite my brain telling me to start trusting with reckless abandon.\n   Stella bites the bottom of her lip and nods but doesn't go any lower than she already was. I pull her into another kiss, and we settle into a lustful yet awkward rhythm. Our movement even out as we get into it, and I risk going in a little deeper into her.\n   Stella suddenly stops and winces in pain \u201cA-ah... F-fuck\u2026\u201d she whimpers as her body once more quakes.\n   I try backing away, panicked, but she keeps me pinned down. Then I feel it.\n   At first, I feel that something weird is going on down there. Like it just got warmer and wetter. I glance down to see what is happening, and then I see it. \n   Blood.\n   My brain freezes. I didn't even consider that Stella could be a virgin like me. Not after that pro of a blowjob she gave me on the roof. \n   I want to apologize to Stella, but somehow I feel like that'd make things worse. When I again stare into her eyes, I see the tears as she desperately tries to gulp the pain down. Yet, her tears aren\u2019t like those from earlier, which were full of sadness and self-loathing. I know for a fact when she gives me the warmest, most love-filled simper I had seen from the stego in my life.\n   We stay connected for a bit before she collapses onto me. There's a pitiful attempt on her part to bounce up and down, but she can't keep that up for more than a few seconds. \n   \u201cUm... Could we... Switch places?\u201d Stella meekly asks, almost as if expecting me to shout at her in anger.\n   \u201cW-we can stop if\u2014\u201d\n   \u201cNo!\u201d she snaps almost in reflex. \u201cI\u2026 I don't want to stop...\u201d\n   Stella gives me a peck on the lips, then gets up. Her stiff, jerky movements show that she's still obviously in pain. She lays down facing upwards, and I get on top of her. We start going at it missionary style, but her face contorts painfully with every one of my thrusts. She tries kissing me again to distract me, but by that point, it\u2019s evident to me that something\u2019s wrong. After about a minute, she gently pushes me away and excuses herself to the bathroom. \nI sit on the bed quietly. Whatever lust-induced bravado I had leaves me as I suddenly start feeling like shit. I try not to overthink the situation as I wait for Stella to return to me. Instead, I quickly jack off and finish before wiping myself off from the various body fluids and search for my pants among the piles of other discarded clothes. When I find them, I fish out my boxers and quickly put those back on before returning to the bed.\n\n","Title":"Bad Bitch Stella - Alternate Sex Scene","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Stella and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Rangto","Summary":"After losing a bet to Stella, Anon is forced to join her for an anime night.

What starts out as an innocent hangout between fellow weebs quickly turns into something more...\n\n\nChapter 1: The Weeb's Trap\n\n\u201cRemind me again why I\u2019m here?\u201d I asked Stella, doing my best to hide both my disinterest and annoyance.\n\n\u201cTo watch the new pilot of SAO with me, of course!\u201d Stella answered in her usual bubbly tone.\n\nI rolled my eyes at her words. \u201cYeah, so, WHY am I here?\u201d I asked again, this time with extra emphasis. \n\n\u201cOh, come on, it can\u2019t be that bad!\u201d Stella replied, all the while smiling ear to ear, though I don\u2019t think that would quite describe it, what with dinos not having visible ears. \u201cI know season two was kinda weak, but this is gonna be infinitely better because\u2026\u201d the lime yellow-toned stego\u2019s words drone on. I sigh and start formulating some generic response in my head as I tune out her narration about the plot and better character development and other things I couldn\u2019t care less about. My inattentiveness doesn\u2019t last long as I\u2019m snapped back to my unfortunate reality when Stella elbows me on the ribs. \u201c...plus, you have me all to yourself! Isn\u2019t that cool?\u201d\n\nI run my hand over the spot where Stella\u2019s elbow struck me in the chest and nod. My mind tells me I should at least feign a smile, but I can\u2019t even bring myself to do that. \n\nWe\u2019re outside Stella\u2019s room in the Volcano High dorms. \u2018I didn\u2019t even know there were dorms,\u2019 I think as the memory of the fancy four-story structure\u2019s exterior comes back to me. Stella is sharing a room with Rosa. I assume that\u2019s how the two got to be friends in the first place. I can hardly imagine any other scenario in which anyone would willingly befriend the lime-yellow stego. I mean, her personality\u2019s okay for the most part, but her random weird stuff is... well, *weird.* Like with the tarot cards and other occult stuff. If her only interests were anime and something else on the normal side like forum surfing and shitposting, she\u2019d be an 8\/10 qt3.14. Hell, I\u2019d even say a 9 if she learned when to keep her mouth from running too much.\n\nStella opens the door to her room and ushers me inside. For some reason, I expected walls covered with pink plush carpeting, a tacky rug, and anime-themed bedsheets. With pink on everything. Instead, the room looked like another dorm room. Cupboards, a bunk bed, two desks, and a mini-fridge were about the only pieces of furniture in the area. There are school supplies and clothes thrown around, though. If I had to take a guess, it was probably Stella\u2019s doing, as I can\u2019t picture prim and proper Rosa leaving anything strewn about. The only things that are out of the ordinary are the posters. Or rather, the absence of them. Almost the entire wall\u2019s covered with dots and lines, some of which I recognize as constellations. What I guess to be a moon cycle chart hangs right next to the bed. Once again, it doesn\u2019t take me long to figure out the impromptu wallpaper and chart are the work of my lime-yellow stego friend.\n\n\u201cSorry, Anon. I didn\u2019t really have the time to clean up!\u201d Stella chirps. She\u2019s blushing as she says it. \n\nNot gonna lie. That\u2019s kinda cute.\n\nWithout much ceremony, Stella picks up a laptop from one of the desks and puts it on the top bunk. \u201cAlright, climb on up. I\u2019ll be back in a sec!\u201d she says with a chipper tone and what I just barely catch as a wink. She disappears behind a door that I didn\u2019t even notice was there, the drawings of stars on it blending in with the wall too much.\n\nI look up at the bunk bed and raise an eyebrow. \u2018So um... she wants me to\u2026 Uhhhhhh\u2026\u2019 I rub my chin with my fingers and make my way towards the vertically stacked beds. I was under the impression that we were going to sit on chairs. Maybe lay on a big fuzzy sofa. Sharing a bed, though\u2014A single bed, mind you\u2014was not what I imagined.\n\nI let out a soft groan. \u2018How am I going to explain this to Fang?\u2019 I ask myself.\n\nWithout another thought, I climb the ladder and sit upon the edge of the bed, my legs dangling down. I turn my head to see what kind of things Stella keeps on her mattress. Sure enough, there are some plushies by her pillow. One looks like a rabbit, but the others are various nondescript figures that I can\u2019t name. At least one is of a Gundam from that one super weird chibi incarnation. As I try to recall the name of that particular series, something catches my nose, a scent mixing strawberries and roses. I pat the mattress one more time, causing the aroma to intensify. \u2018Her bed smells nice,\u2019 I think, all the while letting myself get lost in the pleasant fruity aromas.\n\n\u201cOh, Anon!\u201d Stella calls to me, snapping me away from the desire to bury my head in Stella\u2019s bed. True to her word, she returns a few moments later. Except\u2026\n\n\u2018Wait,\u2019 I think as my eyes fall on Stella. \u201cOh my fucking god...\u201d I mumble as my eyes widen. \u201cIs she\u2026 cosplaying?\u201d\n\nThere, before me, stands Stella dressed in such a way that I have never seen her before. In place of her usual shirt and short jeans, she\u2019s donned a weirdly\u2014or should I say tactically\u2014cut green-white leotard kind of deal, a white scarf, and a blue wig. Even with my limited knowledge of Sword Art Online, I can tell that she\u2019s supposed to be the new heroine from the season three trailers: Asado Shino. She\u2019s even got the breasts for it. The only thing breaking the image is that spindly leg grab with her tail Stella does when excited or nervous.\n\n\u201cW-well, how do I look?\u201d Stella stammered out her question, her cheeks turning a light crimson in the process.\n\n\u201cUmm... nice?\u201d I answer, all the while rubbing the back of my head. I don\u2019t know what kind of answer she\u2019s expecting, but she seems content enough with my reply. \n\nWithout another word from either of us, she climbs up halfway and motions for me to lay correctly on the bed instead of sideways. \n\n\u2018Oh no, she seriously wants to do it like that?\u2019 I think as I look over the bed again. \u2018Pressed shoulder to shoulder on this narrow fucking bed? Not to mention other extremities\u2026\u2019 I let out a snort. \u2018Fine. She won that bet after all. I just hope my pride can let me live this down later.'\n\nI shuffle my body around, careful not to knock Stella off the ladder, and lay on my stomach as close to the wall as I can get. She then finishes her climb and lays next to me. Once she\u2019s reposing on her bed, she picks up her laptop and puts it atop her pillow. Apart of me wants to point out that doing that would choke the poor machine, guaranteeing overheating and a fan full of dust and shit. Ultimately, I decide against saying anything. In truth, I don\u2019t care that much. I just want to get the hangout over with.\n\nOur bodies unavoidably press together as Stella gets comfortable. With her suit cut as it is, I\u2019m very sure that her butt touches me many times. How is that fact not bothering her? I\u2019m sure that my face is plain red right about now. Thank fuck I\u2019m laying dick down and don\u2019t have to worry about Stella noticing my little soldier rising to attention.\n\nOver the next two minutes, Stella browses through various streaming sites she has subscriptions for. Once she narrows down a few high-quality sites with \u2018proper subtitles'\u2014which actually makes me chuckle a bit as I know that the best translations always come with the Blu-Ray releases and not with the broadcast airings\u2014she asks me to choose one. Scanning over the options, I\u2019m instantly drawn towards one of the streams that also includes a built-in option for user commentary. If I couldn\u2019t enjoy SAO, I at least could enjoy reading what others thought about it. Stella seems very happily surprised by my decision, as the small hop on her bed, the cheerful clap, and the broad simper in her lips display. I roll my eyes at first but then giggle. \u2018Her girlish excitement\u2019s kinda cute, I guess,\u2019 I ponder as I try to divert my thoughts away from Stella\u2019s physical appearance. That\u2019s made a bit harder as my mind busies itself tuning out most of the stego\u2019s babbling about something about this or that idol or whatever, who\u2019s apparently the hostess or something like that. Eventually, the SAO intro starts up, and I get deafened by a shrieking Stella.\n\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\" Stella cries out as she grabs one of her more oversized plushies and muffles her screams with it, but not for long. As soon as the lyrics kick in, she starts singing along in very broken wapanese. I try to be friendly and gulp down the desire to laugh at her cringefest. In truth, her out-of-bounds enthusiasm moves some long-forgotten part of me. I mean, when was the last time I browsed headlines without looking for the next tortanic?\n\nI push those thoughts aside and return my attention to the show. By the time I do, the opening has ended, and now we are following some generic-looking anime goons. It isn\u2019t anything special, but Stella doesn\u2019t seem to care. Her legs are up in a crossed position to stop them from running an invisible treadmill, and her tail is non-stop thrashing around. Every now and again, it wraps around one of her legs, but often she mistakes my limb for hers. Stella's closeness and touchiness push my alarms to maximum level. As a result, I can\u2019t even concentrate on the episode. Instead, I\u2019m wiping sweat off my brow and trying not to pay attention to her ass jiggle as she hops every time something \u2018exciting\u2019 happens. Unwelcome thoughts crowd my mind, like \u2018does Stella even have a boyfriend?\u2019 and \u2018Oh fuck, I can\u2019t tell Fang about any of this!\u2019 I do my best to put such considerations out of my head, but I think I would have an easier time forgetting how to breathe.\n\nThe episode eventually ends, and she once again screams into the plushie. There\u2019s a cliffhanger that I don\u2019t care about, but Stella is on edge. \u201cOmigoshAnonwasn\u2019tthatthecoolestthingyoueversaw?\u201d she asks me in such a rapid-fire way that I can\u2019t even begin to unwrap her word\u2019s meanings.\n\nLacking context, or even a clue to begin with, I reply with the first word that comes to mind. \u201c...Okay...\u201d I say in the most deadpan of deadpan tones.\n\nEither content or still too high on her excitement to really dig too deep into my answer, Stella turns onto her back, staring wistfully up at the ceiling. \n\nOne more scream, and it looks like she\u2019s composed herself enough to actually speak coherently. \u201cThat was pretty cool, right?\u201d She asks me as she sets her light blue eyes on mine. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that Sinon was cool? She\u2019s so brave!\u201d\n\nI have to carefully think about what I say here. Even though it\u2019s Stella we\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t want to take these giddy feels away from her.\n\n\u201cY-yeah, it wasn\u2019t that bad...\u201d I answer half-heartedly, all the while putting on my best pretended smile. \u201cCan I\u2026 go now?\u201d I point to the door with my thumb, all the while never breaking eye contact with Stella.\n\n\u201cAww! You really didn\u2019t like it then? But it was so AAAAAAH! PEW PEW!\u201d She replies to my words, even doing the finger guns, in my face, of course.\n\n\u201cIt um... It\u2019s just not to my taste?\u201d I say, all the while shrugging for added emphasis.\n\nStella breaks eye contact with me and goes silent, tugging on her sticky leotard awkwardly. Seconds later, she again snaps her eyes right into mine. \u201cWill you watch the next episode with me?\u201d \n\nI\u2019m honestly so flabbergasted by the sudden shift in Stella\u2019s tone that it takes me quite a few seconds to come up with a reply. Both because of the question itself and her firm voice as she asks it. I find it odd that she'd want me around. Not like I\u2019m in any shape, way, or form benefitting her viewing experience. I mean, she watched the episode practically by herself. I didn\u2019t even need to be here. It hits me that she probably has no one to watch anime with, despite anime being a considerable part of her life. Maybe she gets Rosa to do it every now and again. Still, it\u2019s not like Rosa would care about anime when she has other things she cares about more, like gardening and being a servant for our lord and savior, Raptor Jesus. \n\nDespite a voice somewhere in the back of my mind telling me to drop the subject and go home, I can\u2019t help but ask my next question. \u201cThis is pretty important to you, isn't it?\u201d\n\nStella blushes, hiding her face with the plushie till I can barely look into her eyes. \u201cYes,\u201d she meekly replies.\n\n\u2018I will regret this. I will SO regret this...\u2019\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I say in as neutral a tone as I can muster. \"I'll watch the next episode with you.\"\n\nStella blinks a few times in response. \u201cReally? Y-you will?\u201d\n\nI nod in response. Not like I can add anything more, considering I\u2019m still debating whether it\u2019s actually worth it.\n\nStella muffles another scream with her plush. She almost sounds like she\u2019s getting asked out to prom. \n\nI again point to the door with my thumb. \u201cBut umm\u2026 I really have to go now. I, uh\u2026 promised Fang that\u2019d I, uhhhhh\u2026\u201d \n\nStella\u2019s whole expression deflated pretty quickly at my words. \u201cYeah, yeah, okay. I gotta\u2026 study anyway\u2026\u201d she half-heartedly states.\n\nI wait for a second or two for her to get off the bed, but she won\u2019t move an inch. She only looks at me expectantly.\n\n\u2018Fine,\u2019 I think as I try to climb over the stego, touching her as little as I can. \u2018Dontlookathertits,\u2019 I think over and over like some madness mantra. It was awkward enough that I was trying to climb over a girl lying on a bed. To have that same girl facing upwards and into my eyes as I tried climbing over her was already pushing this scenario into the kind of turf that led to pornos and hentai. \n\nOnce again, I feel her tail wrap around one of my legs. I stop dead in my tracks. Practically doing a handstand above her. \n\nI first look towards the tail, then to Stella\u2019s face. \u201cUhh... Stell\u2014\u201d\n\nShe cuts me off by grabbing me by the back of my neck and bringing me down on top of her, at which point she plants her lips onto mine.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s kissing me,\u2019 I think to myself, my eyes widening as the total weight of what was currently happening strikes me like the Mach 5 going at 200 miles per hour.\n\n\u2018STELLA.\n\n\u2018IS.\n\n\u2018FUCKING.\n\n\u2018KISSING.\n\n\u2018ME!\u2019\n\nI\u2019m frozen on the spot. Despite my position, the best I can manage is not letting my hands grab Stella\u2019s breasts. At that moment, I\u2019m unnaturally aware of the heat and sweet scent of her body, as well as how her tail tightens around my leg muscles. Even the ever so faint strawberry flavor of her lipstick fills my head with a haze. It takes all my willpower not to return the kiss. In fact, I might even fail a bit in that regard.\n\nSadly\u2014\u2018I MEAN THANKFULLY\u2019 I think to myself\u2014the kiss doesn\u2019t last long. Stella withdraws with one last, actually painful, love bite on my lower lip. We stare at each other for a few seconds. I can\u2019t speak at all about what Stella\u2019s love-addled mind must be thinking, but as far as mine goes, I\u2019m grappling with the situation. Hundreds of thoughts run through my brain. From surprise at Stella\u2019s forwardness to pride at having now kissed two girls in my life to horror at the realization that I had kissed someone other than Fang. \n\nAlmost as if picking up on my growing terror\u2014or perhaps having come to a similar conclusion all her own\u2014Stella lets go of my leg and pushes me off her, sitting up on her bed and retreating behind the same oversized plushy she's been screaming into, gripping it so tight that only the upper half of her face is visible. \u201cYou should go, Anon\u2026\u201d she whispers as she looks intensely into my eyes.\n\n\u2018Bitch, what the fuck!\u2019 I think, very nearly forming the words on my tongue before stopping myself. \u2018No. Shit\u2019s weird enough as is,\u2019 I tell myself as I quite spin-fall off the bed akin to my morning ritual, dashing for the door as soon as my feet land on the ground. As I reach for the handle, I glance back at Stella, who is still hiding behind her giant plushie. What little of her face that I can see betrays no emotion, although I swear her eyes look sharp; like she\u2019s some kind of predator sizing up her next prey.\n\n\u2018No. Get out. Sort this out later,\u2019 my mind tells me in response to the idea of asking the stego what had gotten into her. \n\nHeeding my brain\u2019s advice without question, I exit the room.\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nMy head is spinning as I exit the dormitories. \"What the fuck just happened?\" I ask myself despite knowing I don\u2019t really have an answer. I light one of the smokes that Fang lent me, taking a long drag. With the clarity and sharpness of the nicotine rushing through my body, I deduce that the ONLY reason Stella wanted me here tonight was to pull that stunt. \u2018Fucking hell. Now I seriously can\u2019t tell Fang about any of this,\u2019 I bemoan as I take another drag of the cigarette. As I exhale the smoke, I notice some residue of Stella\u2019s lipstick on the filter. Wiping my mouth reveals that not only am I thoroughly covered with it but that her hickey actually drew blood from my lower lip. I can already picture the conversation: \u201cOh yeah, hey Fang! Nah, don\u2019t worry about it. I just headbutted the sidewalk, ha, ha!\u201d\n\nRaptor Jesus, give me strength...\n\nFor a second, I consider marching back into Stella\u2019s room and forcing her to explain what she was thinking. Although, thinking about it a bit more rationally, what was there for her to explain? An affair is pretty fucking straightforward. The worst part is that I don\u2019t exactly hate her for what she did\u2026  \n\nI look down at my hand, smeared with lipstick and my own blood. Slowly I lift it up to my mouth and lick it. Maybe I imagine it, but there seems to be a slight strawberry flavor to the residue I lick\u2026\n\nI shake my head, trying to get the damn thoughts out. I wipe my face again and finish the cigarette.\n\n\u201cFucking Stella,\u201d I hiss through clenched teeth.\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nThe rest of the evening goes by in a relative whirl as I try to figure out how to explain what happened to Fang. It doesn\u2019t matter how much I rack my brain for some kind of solution though, I\u2019m coming up with nothing. I seriously doubt that I\u2019ll be able to hold a poker face next time I see Stella. To top it all off, there\u2019s a part of me that keeps going back to that kiss and how I felt seeing Stella be genuinely excited for her shitty anime. I grimace inwardly as I accept a terrible reality. I can\u2019t deny enjoying both the feeling and the excitement that comes with the idea of secret love.\n\nMy stomach growls, and I get up from my bed. I\u2019ve been trying to fall asleep for the last hour to no avail. Giving in to my hunger, I walk up to my fridge, toss whatever crappy TV dinner I have available into the microwave, and stare at the machine as if it's somehow going to give me answers. When the microwave's chime plays, I take out the food and scoop a bite of still soggy mash potatoes, but I don't enjoy the taste. Eventually, instinctual hunger wins, and I scarf down the meal unceremoniously and unpleasantly. Somehow, the food intake only leaves me feeling emptier than before.\n\nWith a groan of disgust, I decide to take a quick shower and try to go straight to bed again, skipping the sudden urge to indulge in a round of shitposting. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the shower does little to help me sleep. I end up tossing and turning for a long time, unable to get the image of Stella in that tight leotard out of my head. Had she made it herself, or was it store bought? What kind of material was it made of? How had she gotten into it so fast? Had she gotten that cosplay to use at an upcoming con, or had she specifically used it to get a rise out of me?\n\nEventually, the questions become too much for me to bear. Reaching for my phone on the nightstand, I bring up my contacts list. I hover my finger over Stella\u2019s name, the picture on her profile grinning back at me like it somehow knows that I would fall for her tricks. I glance at the time on my phone\u2019s screen. It\u2019s close to midnight. She might still be up.\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d whisper, running my free hand over my face. I had so many questions, but I also don\u2019t want to talk to her about the evening. Was there even a way to bring up her outfit without remembering that kiss? Would she think I\u2019m encouraging whatever it is she\u2019s playing if I message her? \u2018Maybe, just maybe, this was her plan all along,\u2019 I assume as I bring down my finger on her profile and open up my text messaging. I\u2019m only going to ask her about her cosplay. Not like I want something like nudes from her\u2026\n\n...Right\u2026?\n\nI feel a fuzzy feeling down in my trousers as my cock starts to stiffen. I sigh and begin typing. \u201cYou\u2019re right boner, what\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d I mumble to no one in particular.\n\n[Anon]\n\n*hey u sleeping*\n\n[Anon]\n\n*r u still wearing the thing*\n\nToo late do I realize I sent the message without punctuating it. \u201cPunctuation is for retards anyway,\u201d I tell myself as if that\u2019s somehow an excuse for my lack of grammar.\n\nA minute or so later, my phone lights up with incoming messages.\n\n[Stella]\n\n*hi Anon!!! <3*\n\n[Stella]\n\n*yeh, y?*\n\n\u201cA fucking heart right out the door,\u201d I whisper as my brain tries to process Stella\u2019s response. Something instinctual forces my fingers to type \u201csend a pic,\u201d but I erase it without sending. \n\nA part of me is saying that I should stop. That I\u2019m still well within the salvageable zone. That I can still walk out of this relatively unharmed and with my relationships unscathed. My more primal caveman instincts clubs that other voice in the back of the head and instead gives me a thumbs up. \n\n\u2018All the fucking excuse I need!\u2019 I think to myself as I then type \u201csend nudes,\u201d \u201csend feet,\u201d and \u201cbobs and vagene.\u201d I ALMOST fucking send \u201cbitch lasagna\u201d by accident. After that, I start typing in and deleting random letters so that she thinks I\u2019m actually writing a message.\n\n\u2018What the fuck am I even doing? This is so wrong. I have a girlfriend, for fucks sake!\u2019 I think as guilt tries to overpower the horny. Expectedly, horny wins out. My dick knows exactly what it is I want. Plus, it\u2019s kind of adorkable that Stella still has the cosplay on.\n\nWith a deep inhale, I steel my resolve. Fuck me, here it goes.\n\n[Anon]\n\n*send a pic?*\n\nThere is a five-second pause between me hitting send and Stella\u2019s reply.\n\n[Stella]\n\n*!!!*\n\nOh no. I fucked up. \n\nDid I fuck up? \n\nYes. No. Maybe. I don\u2019t know! Could you repeat the question? \n\nMy lizard brain tries getting answers out of my more rational brains. Sadly by this point, the rest of my brain has shut down, almost as if it wanted nothing to do with the clusterfuck of a plan.\n\nThere is no response from Stella for almost five minutes. I start zoning out, disappointed that in my lust-induced texting, I had probably weirded out Stella. Though really thinking about it, maybe it was for the best...\n\nI\u2019m snapped from my slowly returning rationality when my phone buzzes. I instantly open my device and see that Stella, the madwoman, really did send me a picture. It\u2019s dark\u2014she probably didn\u2019t want to alert Rosa\u2014but I can definitely make out two shapely legs and a tummy. To my disbelief, she really is still in that leotard. She\u2019s in bed too. One of her legs has her tail curled up on it.\n\nI find myself smiling like an idiot. What part of my rational thinking that isn't unconscious yet tells me I shouldn\u2019t be getting this horny and excited.\n\n[Anon]\n\n*cute*\n\n[Anon]\n\n*more?*\n\nI really should learn to stop when I\u2019m ahead. This can\u2019t possibly end well for me, but I can\u2019t stop now. My inner caveman is raring to go.\n\n[Stella]\n\n*okie gimme a sec :$*\n\nThere\u2019s no reply from Stella for almost ten minutes. I almost start falling asleep when my phone buzzes again.\n\nWasting no time, I open the messaging up and gaze upon the new photo. This one\u2019s in a lit room this time. The bathroom by the look of the flooring. The picture is of one of Stella's hands. I don\u2019t get it until I notice some opaque slimy goop on the end of her fingers.\n\n[Stella]\n\n*sowwie daddy~ had a Lil accident <3*\n\nMy eyes go as wide as they can as I spring up from my bed. \u201cOh fuck. Oh god. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck,\u201d I start repeating to myself, all the while beads of sweat begin to form on my forehead.\n\nThat\u2019s hot as fuck.\n\nAs I ready my hand to begin fapping like the degenerate that I am, I pause in my tracks as I\u2019m struck by a moment of lucidity. \u2018Did Stella just fucking seriously...?\u2019 I ask myself as the lust slowly begins to consume the lucid rationality. By the time the rest of that thought forms, it's already supplanted by that caveman in the back of my mind, who was now giving me two massive thumb\u2019s ups. \n\n\u201cWell, Anon, that\u2019s it. You made a girl cum. You\u2019re a fucking chad now!\u201d I whisper with a wide goofy grin on my lips. The bliss doesn\u2019t last long. Another flash of lucidity strikes me as I realize how fucked up what I was doing was. Stella had cummed without me doing anything to earn it. The least I could do was send an image back. Maybe a dick pick? No, a dick pic might be over the line. Then again, Stella and I probably passed the line a long time ago and were now halfway across the country.\n\nWhile I still debated whether I should send a dick pic, I sent a quick reply to Stella.\n\n[Anon]\n\n*hawt*\n\nLess than a minute after I sent out my message, Stella sent another picture. It would\u2019ve been her boobs, but it\u2019s all blurry like she fell while taking it.\n\nHer following message explains it all.\n\n[Stella]\n\n*fuk i woke rosa*\n\n[Stella]\n\n*sry bye <3*\n\nI\u2019m mortified at the prospect of Rosa finding out about what Stella and I have been up to. I hope she can explain it away somehow. Or, at the very least, get the shoe-to-the-face treatment for being a slut and not for\u2026 sending semi-nudes to a guy with a girlfriend\u2026\n\nBy this point, my inner caveman has retreated back to his cave of degeneracy, allowing my other rational sides to wake up once again. The total weight of my stupidity then begins sinking in like a bag of cement bricks to water. \n\n\u201cWhy did I do it?\u201d I ask myself as I look over the pictures Stella managed to send before we were so rudely interrupted. Combined with the memory of the kiss, it did wonders to help the growing shame and guilt take over my mind. There is NO WAY I\u2019ll be able to explain this shit to Fang anymore. \n\nNo. Fang can\u2019t know about ANY of this. Ever!\n\n...\n\nRealizing that I was still very hard, and not wanting Stella\u2019s efforts to go to waste, I mutely jerk off to the pics. As I do, my mind begins wandering more and more. It\u2019s not long before I go from simply jerking it to the images on my phone to straight-up imagining what it would be like to fuck Stella, her surprisingly lithe body rubbing against mine as we forsake any and all social expectations and make sweet, passionate, nerdy love\u2026\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m at it. I only remember cumming harder than I had before in my life and passing the fuck out, my dreams filled with Stella.\n\nOnly Stella...","Title":"Bad Bitch Stella Remastered","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Naser, Reed, Naomi, Rosa, Stella and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"Rangto","Summary":"After losing a bet to Stella, Anon is forced to join her for an anime night.

Meanwhile, my morbid imagination forms images of an angry shotgun wielding Fang chasing me through the streets of Volcaldera for ever daring to cheat on her.\n\nI flop to the side and put a hand over my face. I feel like shit, and I know that I deserve to feel like shit. Hell, I deserve to feel worse. As I look at my clock still blaring its 6 AM alarm, I can\u2019t help but want to crawl back into bed and die.\n\nI've done something unforgivable. The worst part? It\u2019s not even over. Oh no. Today my newest dark secret might come to light for all the world to know. The question is, who will spill the beans? Rosa? Stella? Hell, even me if I slip up. With the blessed curse that is post-nut clarity, I can't even begin to rationalize why I even did what I did besides getting a quick and dirty kick out of it. I love Fang. I would never do anything to hurt her, yet here I was, having done everything short of straight-up sex with someone else.\n\nI flip through my messages, hoping to Raptor Jesus or whatever other deities I haven't yet pissed off with my stupidity that it would all turn out to be a dream. \u2018A pleasant, sexytime-filled dream,\u2019 I begin imagining before shaking my head. \u2018No. No horny,\u2019 I scold myself as I scroll through my message history. Of course, as soon as I hit last night\u2019s time, the entire conversation between Stella and me comes up. It\u2019s all there, clear as day for anyone to see and judge.\n\n\u201cThis is a nightmare,\u201d I mumble as I put my phone down and bury my face in my hands. I\u2019ve gone and committed the biggest sin in any relationship. Worse is that I can't even ask anyone for advice. What would they tell me other than how big of a fuck-up it was?\n\nJust as I\u2019m about to give in to despair, I remember that there was someone I could talk to. It was a long shot, but he\u2019s been nothing short of a bro up to this point. \u201cI mean, Reed probably doesn\u2019t know much about relationships, and I\u2019m 50% sure he\u2019s pitching for the other team, but who else can I turn to?\u201d \n\nIt was a long shot, but there was at least the chance that Reed would keep the whole fiasco on the down-low. If nothing else, at least keep Fang from getting too emotionally hurt. Then again, he might also cut ties with me once I tell him. I'd totally deserve it. Still, it's the best plan I can come up with. That, and trying to find Stella alone somewhere and try to clear up this clusterfuck.\n\nWith my plan now set in my mind, I get out of bed and start my morning routine. It takes me considerably longer to get ready that morning than any other morning in recent memory...\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nI move around the school, doing my best to avoid anyone that isn\u2019t Reed. Fortunately, Trish is absent today, so I can talk with the pink raptor alone right before math class, our first class of the week. I also haven't yet run into Fang. Or Stella. Or Rosa. My luck can only hold on for so long, and Reed immediately gets suspicious of my fidgeting around. He at least waits until near the end of class when everyone else is too engrossed in their own conversations to confront me about it.\n\n\u201cSomething up, bro?\u201d Reed asks me, curiosity burning in his eyes. \u201cYou haven\u2019t really been yourself all class period.\u201d\n\nI hesitate for a second before buckling down for what I\u2019m about to say. \n\n\u201cReed, um... can you keep a secret?\u201d\n\n\u201cHells yeah, man!\u201d Reed answers in his usual optimistic tone. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if it's something really fucked up?\u201d I ask, all the while leaning closer to the raptor to avoid unwanted ears tuning in.\n\nThe smile Reed was sporting seconds ago drops at my words. \u201cYeah. \u2018Course,\u201d he responds.\n\nI contemplate backing off or lying, but I know Reed enough that after that intro, he would see right through whatever deception I come up with. Besides, he\u2019s my bro and probably the only other person right now that I can trust with what I've done.\n\n\u201cReed\u2026 I seriously fucked up, man. Like, really, REALLY seriously fucked up! And I don't know what to do!\u201d\n\nReed looks at me expectantly, his eyes wide and ready to absorb even my subtlest of movements. \n\nOn my end, I don't even know where to begin. \u2018I guess from the very start\u2019s a good place as any,\u2019 I think to myself as I queue up the memories in my brain. \n\n\u201cSo, you remember that bet I had going with Stella?\u201d\n\nReed chuckles. \u201cAh yeah, that bet. Let me guess, Stella won?\u201d\n\nI nod in reply, which only causes Reed to snicker some more. \u201cSo what was the wager you two made?\u201d he asks me with growing curiosity.\n\n\u201cShe got me to watch some shit with her. You know, anime.\"\n\nReed crosses his arms and nods. So far, so good. But now came the part that I was most afraid of\u2026\n\n\u201cSo she invited me to her house. Except she doesn\u2019t have a house. She rents one of the dorm rooms I didn\u2019t even know we had.\u201d\n\nReed again chortles. \u201cWait, you\u2019re telling me you didn\u2019t know that the school has dorm rooms available for rent?\u201d\n\nThinking about it, I have to ask myself why my father didn\u2019t actually send me to one of the rooms here instead of a shitty apartment in Skin Row. My only answer is that it was probably cheaper. My transfer over to Volcano High had been an emergency, so money was probably super tight\u2026 \n\nI shake my head. Now\u2019s not the time to think of the reasons why I was living in squalor. \u201cThat\u2019s beside the point,\u201d I tell Reed and move on from any lingering thoughts on the matter. \u201cThe point is, Stella invited me to her room. I get there, and she\u2019s all alone. Next thing I know, she\u2019s convinced me to get on her bed and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not!\u201d Reed suddenly snaps, all the while moving forward and grabbing me by the arms, surprising me enough that I swore he was about to bite me. \n\n\u201cNo. NO!\u201d I retort before the situation can get any uglier. \u201cIt uh\u2026 went well, actually. The watching anime part.\u201d I rub the back of my neck, but my words barely do anything to stop Reed from looking at me with an intense glower. \u201cAfter the episode ended, though\u2026 Stella like\u2026 kissed me out of fucking nowhere!\u201d \n\nReed\u2019s already wide eyes open even wider\u2014if that was possible. \u201cStella... kissed you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d I snap at the velociraptor with some annoyance. \u201cIt was so sudden and unexpected that I just bolted the fuck out! But\u2026\u201d\n\nReed again leaned in closer to my face. \u201c...But\u2026?\u201d He demands, his expression a mixture of worry and expectation.\n\nI groan. \u2018Can't do it. Jesus Reed, you would never talk to me if you knew,\u2019 I think as I struggle to form words on my tongue. I take a look around the room. Thankfully, nobody is paying us any attention despite our intense conversation. Thank god for small miracles, at least.\n\nRealizing that I\u2019m way too far into this to leave it as is, I open my mouth to plan my next set of words. Instead of coming out smoothly, they get stuck in my throat as I struggle to have them come out and not sound like I\u2019m making the wrong impression of a Mongolian throat singer. \u201cI\u2014then\u2014night\u2014jacked\u2014\"\n\nTo my surprise, Reed's troubled face lightens as a gentle grin forms on his lips. \u201cDude, you did the jenkem to the kiss?\u201d he asks me matter-of-factly.\n\nI shut my mouth and nod in response.\n\nReed lets out a sigh of his own and fixes me with a stern yet compassionate stare. \u201cYeah, that's kinda fucked up, but like\u2026 you just gotta let Stella down, you know like\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was pictures. She sent pictures. I asked, and she sent me pictures,\u201d I snapped. My statement shuts Reed right the fuck up as he freezes in an attempt to process the literal nuke I had dropped on him.\n\n\u201cDude\u2026 are you\u2026 serious?\u201d Reed asks in a soft, almost shell-shocked tone.\n\nI say nothing. What the fuck could I say? \n\nMy silence is answer enough for Reed. He slumps back into his chair and puts both hands over his face. From what little of his visage I can see through his hands, he looks like someone who refuses to believe what he just heard.\n\n\u201cMan\u2026 this is absolutely fucked up...\u201d He whispers before sitting up straight and letting out a weary exhale. He rubs the back of his neck and then fixes me with a glance equal parts angry and disappointed. \u201cFang doesn't know jack, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn't. Not yet,\u201d I answer, unable to keep my voice from trembling in terror.\n\nReed looks down at the floor, almost as if he can\u2019t bear to look me in the eyes anymore.\n\n\u201cI don't know what to do, man. I figured that I'll talk to Stella today and get her to back off. Still, I don't know how to handle the Fang situation,\" I say before reaching out to grab Reed by the arms, much in the same way he did to me earlier in our conversation. \u201cHelp me out here, man, please!\u201d\n\nBefore Reed can speak whatever words he formed in his mouth, my phone buzzes. I reach for my device and bring up the home screen, showing the message notification is from none other than Stella. I flip the phone over to Reed and show him the screen for dramatic effect, and he looks back at me with maybe the most intense stare I had ever seen from him since first arriving in Volcano High.\n\n\u201cI can't\u2026 can\u2019t help you, bro. I'll keep this a secret, but Fang\u2019s my friend, and I won't lie to her, even if it's to help out another friend.\u201d\n\nMy heart starts racing. Despite a part of me knowing that it was for the best, Reed\u2019s words make me feel as if my ass is about to prolapse at any second...   \n\nReed closes his eyes and scowls, all the while scratching his head furiously. \u201cLook, bro\u2026 I'll hold Fang off for today so you can handle Stella. But you better fucking explain it to her after!\u201d Reed sighs and continues in a mellow tone. \u201cYou fucked up. Fang might be willing to look the other way 'cause you seriously seem like you know that it's fucked. And that you were the one to fuck it into the ground in the first place...\u201d\n\nAt Reed\u2019s words, I feel a wave of relief wash over me. It wasn\u2019t over yet, but this was more than I could have hoped for. Thank you, based god Reedman. \u201cThanks, dude! I\u2026 I owe you a big one!\u201d\n\nReed holds a hand up at my words. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet,\u201d he says ominously. \u201cYou make it up to Fang, and we're square. This is a one-time thing; you better believe it.\u201d\n\nI'm about to respond when the bell goes off. Reed immediately gets up from his chair and leaves, but not before fixing me with a \u2018you-so-do-not-want-to-fuck-this-up\u2019 glare that sends chills down my spine and turns my blood cold.\n\nWhen the shock of seeing a pissed-off Reed finally wears off, I instinctually make my way to my next class. The walk helps clear my head a bit and lets me think about my next move. \n\nWith Reed running interference for me today, that gave me precious time to try and get my trainwreck of a life back into some semblance of order before it was too late. \n\nWith that, I remember Stella\u2019s message from a few minutes ago. Dreading what I would see, I have to mentally prepare myself before opening up my messaging app. A part of me is hopeful that she\u2019s come to her senses and feels guilty over what we did last night. Or, at the very least, she\u2019s ready to listen to reason over horniness.\n\nI scroll up to see Stella\u2019s latest messages.\n\n[Stella]\n\n*i got called a bad girl Anon*\n\n[Stella]\n\n*am I a bad girl? <3 <3*\n\nMy mind goes blank, and essentially I do the blinkingguy.gif motion. Though I want to ignore the message and pretend I never saw it, my mind reminds me of what I need to do. This is my chance.\n\n[Anon]\n\n\"lunch. roof.\"\n\nThe bell rings again as I finish typing. I shut my phone off and make a mad sprint to my next class. Only when I turn the corner and see the room do I remember that my next class was music\u2026\n\n\u2018Oh fuck no\u2026\u2019 I think as the feeling of my ass prolapsing returns to me a second time. One more, and it will officially beat my current record\u2026\n\nBefore I can panic any more, I feel my phone buzz again. I don\u2019t even need to think about who sent the message. I only pick up my pace and reach the class before my absence is noted down by Mr. Jingo. Thankfully, I\u2019m able to slip in undetected. \n\nThe first thing I do is scan the room for signs of Fang. To my surprise, my goth ptero girlfriend seems to be missing. Before I can fully register the implications of Fang\u2019s absence, Mr. Jingo walks up to me. \u201cI'm afraid your partner won't be back for a while,\u201d he tells me matter-of-factly. \u201cThey're helping Reed with something school-mascot-related. Don\u2019t quite know what it was, but it sure sounded dire for Reed to barge in here and snatch Fang away from us.\u201d\n\nI take a huge sigh and almost collapse from the relief. \u2018THANK FUCK!\u2019 I think as I give Mr. Jingo my best feigned disappointed look. \u201cO-okay,\u201d I reply to my teacher, who hands me my day\u2019s assignment sheet and leaves me to my own devices. \n\nAs soon as Mr. Jingo walks back to his desk to do whatever the fuck it was that he usually did when not teaching, I rush to the furthest spot in the back of the room and take out my phone to check the new message from Stella. To my surprise, there was a couple from Fang too. I tap on my girlfriend\u2019s profile and bring up her messages first.\n\n[Fang]\n\n*soz ditching w\/ Reed*\n\n[Fang]\n\n*ill help u after school :V*\n\nWow. If I wasn't yet feeling shitty, that sure did it. Still, with Fang gone from music class, that meant I didn\u2019t have to worry about her until after school. Hell, probably even tomorrow if I really wanted to be extra careful. It sucked having to play a game of hide and seek with her, though. I\u2019d typically be doing everything in my power to actively hang out with her more.\n\nWith Fang\u2019s messages checked, I turn my attention to Stella\u2019s.\n\n[Stella]\n\n*okie <3*\n\nAfter the text, there was a picture attached. A closeup of Stella\u2019s mouth making a blowjob gesture with her hand.\n\nI almost drop the phone. \u201cThis fucking bitch,\u201d I whisper to myself as I stuff my phone in my pocket and try to focus on schoolwork for once.\n\nOf course, the more I try to focus on my music assignment, the more I remember the picture Stella sent me. Much as I hated to admit it, her blowjob gesture was getting a nice rise out of me. Had it not been for my conflicting emotions over the morality of what I was mixed up in, I would have asked Mr. Jingo for permission to use the bathroom...\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nA few hours and many, many rejected instances of self indulge later, lunchtime arrives. Rather than making my way to the lunchline as I usually would, I power walk towards the roof, all the while trying to work through my conflicted feelings.\n\nWould it be that bad to keep Stella around? That is if we can keep it a secret? Looks like that's her agenda in the first place. If she wanted me and Fang to break up, she's got more than enough leverage on me. This was all still a major fucking red flag, but it's not like I'm deliberately setting out to hurt Fang.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure that I'd ever be able to look at myself in the mirror again. Fang will surely know that something's up, and then it will be only a matter of time until she figures it out. Plus, there's Reed. Judging by the glare he gave me, he will never let me get away with it.\n\nNo. The only way out of this was for me to set this mess straight and set down some real boundaries. \n\nScanning the surroundings, I conclude that I'm alone on the roof. No messages from Stella, so I'm assuming she's on her way. I guess correctly, as only a minute or two after the thoughts cross my mind, she makes her appearance. She's wearing her usual shirt and shorts combo. Part of me is thankful for that. Makes this all the more normal. Or at least as normal as this situation\u2019s become.\n\n\u201cHey, Anon!\u201d Stella waves to me in her usual bubbly tone.\n\nI don't respond. Instead, I walk up to Stella and grab her by the forearm before forcefully dragging her behind the little shed Fang preened on top of that one time.\n\n\u201cGeez! Okay!\u201d Stella calls out as she pulls her arm back. Seems like she's not really sure what to expect.\n\nI take a deep sigh and steel my resolve for what I need to do next.\n\n\u201cStella, this can't continue,\u201d I start in as dead-serious a tone as I can possibly muster. \u201cI have a girlfriend, who you know, by the way. I shouldn't have led you on last night either, so I am sorry. But please, let's not go any further than this.\u201d After I finish my announcement, I cross my arms and look away from the lime-yellow stego, no longer able to bring myself to keep eye contact.\n\nThere's total silence for a while. To my surprise, Stella steps closer, causing me to back into the wall.\n\n\u201cNo further, so\u2026 We should keep things as they are?\u201d Stella asks in a sultry tone as she grabs my belt with both hands, pulling her body closer to mine. \u201cCause I really am your Bad Bitch now, Anon!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m fucking speechless. I want to push Stella away, yet I can't find the strength to lift a single finger. I don\u2019t know if it's because my brain still recognizes her as one of the only friends I have or if it's because that damn inner caveman is bouncing off the walls with excitement over our forbidden romance. Whatever the case, a part of me can\u2019t help but be absolutely enraptured by Stella\u2019s forwardness and boldness in the face of disaster.\n\nIt\u2019s almost admirable.\n\nI quickly shake off what other thoughts I have in my mind and focus on the here and now. \u201cThat's not what\u2014\u201d I start, but I\u2019m cut off by the creaking of the roof access door.\n\n\u201cAre you sure this is okay? Isn't the roof like, off-limits?\u201d the all-too-familiar voice of Fang\u2019s brother echoes feet away from where Stella and I were hiding.\n\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d the voice of Volcano High\u2019s outrageously dawn-tinted class president, and general pain in my ass, answers.\n\nMy eyes widen in absolute horror. What the fuck are Naser and Naomi doing up here during their lunchtime?\n\nI hear the door shut behind the two. \u201cShit, fine. Let\u2019s do this...\"\n\nI\u2019m absolutely frozen in place by fear of discovery. A quick check at Stella tells me that she's as frozen as I am. The thing is, I don\u2019t know if it's because of fear or because she\u2019s thinking of somehow turning this to her advantage...\n\nI can hear clothes shuffling and a belt getting undone.\n\nMy eyes widen in horror. \n\nNo. \n\nOh god, please, please no. No. \n\nNooooooooooooooooo!\n\nNot one second after my brain nearly shuts down, the unmistakable sounds of slurping, gagging, and moaning hit my ears. With each passing second, I can hear the wet slapping of a cock being taken into a mouth with increasing speed. The drip of what can't be anything other than spit and cum hit the ground as the moans of pleasure grow louder and louder.\n\nThis can't be real. I've fainted, and this is a dream, right? \n\nRight!? \n\nBefore I can even register it, a full minute\u2019s passed by as Naser hisses and moans, and Naomi grunts pleasurably as she very obviously works her tongue over Naser\u2019s pleased soldier. From the lewd sounds hitting my ears, It doesn't sound like they'll be done anytime soon\u2026 \n\nWhere the fuck was Spear kicking down the door to the roof when you needed him most?\n\nMuch to my dismay, Stella shifts closer to me, all the while looking into my eyes me with a sultry, aroused expression. I can\u2019t stop her as she presses her breast against my chest, nor can I even think of shoving her away as she wraps her tail around my leg and presses her face against mine. \u201cAww, Anon, maybe we should do something too?\u201d she whispers seductively into my ear.\n\n\u201cS-shut the fuck up,\u201d I whisper to Stella in a stuttery voice. Not one second after I whisper those words, the disturbing sound of throat fucking echo in the air, Naomi being perhaps a little too eager to please Naser.\n\nStella can't help but giggle, all the while gently caressing my face with her hand. \"Mmmm, can you hear how hard Naser is giving it to Naomi? So hot, right?\" As she again whispers that into my ear, she moves her other hand towards my crotch. Without wasting a single beat, she begins unzipping my pants, her hand effortlessly reaching through my underwear and right for my already rock-hard dick.\n\nAs much as I fucking hated it, I couldn\u2019t deny what my body was telling me. Yes, it was the hottest single thing I had ever heard in my life. It was making me so horny that the only thing stopping me from fucking Stella then and there was my loyalty towards Fang.\n\n\u201cShut up! Shut up! Shut up!\u201d I hiss through clenched teeth as I try to keep Naser and Naomi from finding us.\n\nBefore I can stop her, Stella gets on her knees releases my dick from its boxy prison. She pauses for a second to marvel at its size before opening her mouth in eager anticipation for me to take the initiative.\n\n\"Stop it!\" I hiss through clenched teeth.\n\n\u201cMake me!\u201d Stella snaps with a smirk on her face. \n\n\u201cFuck, did you hear that?\u201d Naomi suddenly asks, stopping her fellatio play as she no doubt looks around for any possible witnesses.\n\n\u201cNahIdidn'thearanything,\u201d Naser says in a stupefied tone, almost as if he\u2019s struggling to maintain his faculties in his bliss-addled state.\n\nI glance to the side in fear and then glance back down towards Stella, who, with my dick still in her hand, fixes me with an impatient look. When she takes a breath in preparation for saying something else that will no doubt cause us to get caught, I grab the back of her head and force her to take my dick all the way in. \n\nBitch wants to get shut the fuck up, then I\u2019ll shut her the fuck up. \u2018Yeah, try talking with a throat full of cock,\u2019 I think to myself as I push my dick as far into Stella\u2019s throat as I can make it go. The suddenness of my entry surprises her, but to the stego\u2019s credit, she doesn't gag one bit. It honestly impresses me. \n\nI keep Stella\u2019s mouth plugged with my dick, her short snoot pressed up against my stomach, until Naomi once again starts throat fucking Naser. Even with the two turning their attention back to themselves, I can\u2019t help but feel my whole body shaking in panic. At the same time, I'd be a dirty liar if I said it didn't feel great having my dick rammed up Stella\u2019s throat. With her unable to move her head, I can feel her tongue exploring my length. From the other side of the shed, the noises intensify. Naser\u2019s really giving it to Naomi now. By the sounds of it, Naomi\u2019s taking it like a champ too.\n\n\u201cFfffuucckkk!\u201d Naser shouts orgasmically. I guess that's him finishing. Truth is, I'm not that far behind. Even in her current circumstance, Stella is doing all she can to tip me over. Silently too, thank fuck.  \n\nSomewhere inside the building, a bell rings. The sound of shifting clothing and a zipper getting pulled fills the air before the sound of shuffling footsteps follows. I hear the door open as Naser and Naomi leave the roof, all the while flirting with one another, no doubt riding the high of having had sex on school grounds. \n\nWhen the door at last slams shut, I let out the breath of air I\u2019d been holding since before the bell rang. I'm so relieved that I immediately let go of Stella's hair and prepare to remove my dick from her mouth. But she doesn't budge one bit. If anything, she fixes me with a lust-filled stare as she doubles down and starts to suck me dry.\n\nI peer down at Stella with a combination of horror and bliss. \u2018Am I going to...? Will she seriously make me...?\u2019 I think, not quite sure what to make of the situation I practically walked into. There\u2019s nowhere to run with a wall behind me. \n\nDo I even want to run?\n\nI swallow hard and again gaze down at Stella. She\u2019s still looking right back up at me with those soft light blue eyes of hers, eyes that were now streaking tears, which ran down her blushed cheeks, all the while my dick remained embedded deep in her throat. Nothing but the bulge on the outside is visible mids the strands of saliva almost reaching down to the floor.\n\nAs the pleasure increases tenfold, I grab on to her hair buns with both of my hands and start to awkwardly move my hips back and forth. Once again, she takes the impromptu facefuck like a total pro.\n\nSoon, I reach the point of no return. With one last shove, I force my entire dick down into her throat again. Seconds later, I cum with a force that I had never experienced before in my life. \n\nStella closes her eyes and takes my load with loud gulping sounds. She swallows a total of five times, quite literally milking me dry of every last drop of baby batter before slowly backing off and letting my dick pop from her mouth with a lewd slurping sound.\n\nUsing her shirt, she cleans up the drool the best she can, humming to herself contently. Meanwhile, my heart has practically stopped beating. With the climax over and the post-nut clarity mercilessly washing over me, shame and helplessness hit me double-fold. My legs give away, and I slide down beside the wall. Thankfully Stella doesn't cuddle up to me. She keeps her distance and only kneels next to me. Maybe she finally realizes how far she's gone, or perhaps seeing me so miserable struck a chord with her. Whatever the case, at this point, it doesn't even fucking matter anymore. I almost choke up on the spot. \u2018That's it, my life is fucking over,\u2019 I lament as a hollowness taker over my chest. I stay there, legs splayed and softening dick still out, not really caring who sees me anymore...\n\n\u201cA-are you alright, Anon?\u201d Stella asks me.\n\nI look at the yellow-lime-toned stego next to me, my brow furrowing and the flames of anger I had previously snuffed once more igniting. \u2018Bitch, what do you think?\u2019 I think, so very tempted to scream it. Instead, I clutch my hands tight and frown. \u201cYes, Stella, how could you tell? This is me being alright!\u201d \n\nStella doesn\u2019t answer, but I can tell that she\u2019s also noticed the change in mood. After about a minute of silent suffering, my now non-existent dignity compels me to at least put my dick away. And so, I very slowly stand up and stuff my now flaccid and shrunken soldier back into his barracks. \n\nAs I finish zipping up my pants, Stella also stands up and puts a hand on my left hand, all the while smiling softly. \u201cIt's okay,\u201d she coos soothingly, almost as if that\u2019s somehow supposed to make me feel any better about myself.  \n\nAs Stella flutters her eyelids and grins like she is head-over-heels in love with me, something within me snaps. \u201cOH!? It's OKAY?!\u201d I shout so loud that I'm sure the entire school hard it. Frankly, I don\u2019t give a damn at this point. \u201cWow, Stella! Did you read that from the stars? Or a deck of cards? Are you such an expert in bitching yourself out from all the hentai doujin that you've read? Or maybe it's because you routinely ruin others' lives? Maybe that's got something to do with you having SOOOO many friends, right?!\" I glare deep into the stego\u2019s eyes with such fury that I\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t yet burst into flames. \u201cMaybe you should just fucking neck yourself, you retard!\u201d I say, leaving nothing to interpretation as I make a hanging motion with my hand. \n\nGod, it feels good to get that anger off my chest. At the same time, I know deep down that I'm looking for an outlet to vent my pent-up feelings. That I've gone way, way too far with my words. Yes, this whole mess started because Stella wanted to have a little fling on the side, but I played along as willingly. I can think of several dozen ways to avoid this whole situation, all involving talking to my girlfriend and working through this problem as a couple should. Instead, I let my fucking caveman instincts decide for me\u2026\n\nI want to keep shouting, but I don't even have the strength for that anymore. My shoulders drop, and I fall back down again, curling in a fetal position in the process. I just now notice the hot tears rolling down my face. What a pathetic excuse for a man I must look like. Thank Raptor Jesus, there aren\u2019t any mirrors up here...\n\nBy some miracle\u2014or would it be a curse in this case?\u2014Stella hasn't stormed off yet. From the corner of my eye, I can see her fists shaking as she grasps the end of her jeans so hard that her knuckles have turned white. As I pay closer attention, I can see that her cheeks have once again turned a shade of red, and her eyes shimmer in the sunlight.\n\n\u201cT-take that back!\u201d Stella shouts at me almost as loud as I had been yelling at her. \u201cAnon, take it back!\u201d She takes a step forward and looks me deep in the eyes. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Her voice is soft yet strained, almost as if she's doing everything in her power to hold back tears. Judging by how damp her eyes look, she won't be able to for long.\n\nDespite all my rage, seeing Stella in such a downed state gives me no pleasure. If anything, it only further helps in making me feel utterly and downright miserable. At once, I realize that somehow, I've managed to piss off or alienate almost everyone that I know and hold dear in just a few hours. If I don't do something, I'll end up alone again. Fang and Reed can be mad at me for a good reason. Hell, I won't even have anything to say if Naser breaks my arms. Or neck. \n\nBut Stella... \n\nNo, I really did say some fucked up stuff. Can\u2019t bullshit my way around that. She might be a huge bitch for getting me in this position, but she doesn't deserve this. I remember her giddy, pure, and genuine excitement for SAO\u2019s new season last night. I find it almost hard to believe that the girl I throat fucked a few minutes ago is the same girl. Still, that bundle of anime-loving joy was still somewhere in there, and I can't turn someone like that into a broken, cynical dipshit like me.\n\nUnlike everything else, I still have a chance to make this right, at least.\n\n\u201c...I'm sorry\u2026\u201d I whisper out my apology initially. 'Common man. You can do better,\u2019 I tell myself as I take a deep breath and sit up from my fetal position. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say with more self-assurance. \u201cI take it all back. You're not so bad, Stella.\u201d I wipe some of my tears off, not that it really accomplishes anything, but it at least helps me maintain some small amount of pride. \n\nStella seems reluctant to absorb my words at first. After a few seconds, though, she sits next to me and places a hand on my shoulder. As she does, she wipes some of the tears off her own face and once more looks deep into my eyes with those light-blue pools of radiance of hers.  \n\nWe stay like that for a good while. Or at least until our tears dry.\n\n\u201cSo... are you okay now?\u201d Stella asks, her voice the first sound to break the silence that had fallen between us.\n\n\u201c...I guess,\u201d I answer, not quite sure if my words are even applicable considering the current situation.\n\nStella removes her hand from my shoulder and coughs softly. \u201cSo um... I'm not stupid. I know why you called me here.\u201d\n\nStella\u2019s words stun me. Where's this coming from all of a sudden?\n\n\u201cAnd\u2026 and I know you\u2019re soooo crazy about Fang...\u201d She scoots closer to me and fixes me with what almost looks like a desirous expression. \u201cBut geez! Take a reality check!\u201d\n\nI... \n\nWhat?\n\n\u201cYou've known Fang for what? A month?\u201d Stella questions, all the while keeping her eyes locked straight on mine. \u201cYou've been dating for half of that tops! It's not like\u2026 you're engaged or whatever...\u201d At those words, Stella stands up and walks to the side, hands behind her back and tail swinging back and forth. \u201cSo what if you fool around with another girl? That\u2019s the nature of love!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m honestly at a loss for words. What Stella says sort of makes sense, but... fool around? I'm in a relationship, for fucks sake! She\u2019s also right that it hasn't been going on for long, but that doesn't give me the right to cheat on my partner. And if she's right, then what's the deal with Reed? He KNEW that this shit's fucked. And so did I.\n\nWell, I mean\u2026 \n\nI stand up and put a hand on my right temple, massaging the spot to keep a growing headache from intensifying. Not counting my socially inept ass, now I have two opposing extremes that both make sense in their own way. The question was, which one would Fang agree with? \u2018Let's assume that\u2014\u2019\n\n\u201cUmm, Anon?\u201d Stella suddenly spoke up, breaking me out of whatever train of thought I was about to board. \n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d I say, turning to face Stella with a puzzled look.\n\n\u201cYou've been like, mumbling for two minutes straight, is everything alright?\u201d Stella asks. Her face is a mixture of genuine concern and slight amusement.\n\nFucking mumbling. I swear it\u2019s going to get me killed one of these days\u2026\n\n\u201cUh, yeah\u2026\u201d I answer as I stop any and all loud thoughts. \n\nFor her part, Stella fidgets around a bit, apparently unsure what to do with the still-unfolding situation. Traces of her tears are still visible on her face, though I'm not sure if they\u2019re from me being a dick or my literal dick acting like an improvised gag. I don't even know which of the two would make me feel worse, in all honesty.\n\nI decide that changing the subject is the best course of action. \u201cSo uhh\u2026 you like... cards?\u201d \n\nAt first, Stella doesn't get what I mean by how vague the question is. It takes her an entire half a minute to realize what I\u2019m asking.\n\n\u201cOh! You mean tarot cards!\u201d Stella responds in the same peppy and bubbly way that I recall before the whole 'Bad Bitch Stella' persona came to light.\n\nI nod, bracing myself for what was no doubt about to be a very long lecture on a subject matter I couldn\u2019t possibly give less of a fuck about. But the goal right now was to have some levity after all the crap that had happened minutes earlier.\n\nOver the next half hour, Stella explains to me all the nuances of tarot cards. What each card\u2019s named, and how readings work. She explains the two aspects of tarot, those being the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. She carefully and expertly describes what each suit of the Major Arcana is named and what they represent, as well as what they can be interpreted as depending on their orientation upon a draw. She then tells me about the Fool\u2019s journey, which is the most prominent lesson that one can take away from the tarot. Finally, she explains the Minor Arcana and how it's often neglected because it tends to be more complicated and numerous. Still, it is just as crucial as the Major Arcana. \n\nAs I listen to Stella explain a subject that she loves so dearly, something funny happens. I start to pay attention. With each of her words, the information sinks in. Her genuine enthusiasm for what should be a silly fortune-telling method slowly wins me over. Truth was, if I don't focus on her weirdness too much, she's not bad at teaching. Apparently, she puts the same amount of care and innocent ambition into anything she likes.\n\nThat makes me wonder if that includes her friendship towards me\u2026\n\nWe end up ditching the rest of the class. During that hour, I learned far more about tarot than I would have ever actively tried to comprehend. With Stella\u2019s tutelage, I almost felt like I could start giving out amateurish readings of my own. Not that I ever would since I still thought the whole thing was silly mysticism. Still, it was something new that I would have otherwise never bothered with, and learning it felt\u2026 kinda nice\u2026\n\nWe're snapped out of our tarot discussion when the bell rings. I consider for a second ditching the rest of my classes to stay on the roof, but I ultimately decide against it. I bid Stella an awkward goodbye, one she replies to hesitantly, almost as if she wanted to say something else before deciding against it. \n\nStella is the last to leave the rooftop...\n\nThe rest of my classes go without further incident, leaving me to contemplate all my life decisions up to that point. Fang messages me a few times, short status reports on what they're doing with Reed. Sounds like Reed\u2019s keeping good on his promise and managed to trap Fang for the entire day.\n\nIn a twisted way, it makes me want to laugh. My original plan is all but ruins now, and I haven't gotten a single step closer to solving the issue with Stella. Quite the opposite, actually. But after listening to Stella and spending time with her\u2026 \n\nA growing part of me doesn't even want to explain anything to Fang anymore\u2026 \n\nMy brain comes to a halt at those thoughts as I try and process what my neurons are trying to tell me. Who even says that I\u2019m in a serious relationship with Fang? We've never announced it as such and only gone on, like, two dates. That's not a relationship; that's literally dating, and barely at that. Closer to feeling the waters, actually. So what if I'm seeing another girl? I Gotta keep my options open, no?\n\nI lean back on my chair and bury my hands in my face for what feels like the millionth time that day. \u2018Who am I trying to convince here?\u2019 I ask myself. It sounded more like I was trying to make up bullshit excuses to myself. \n\nThese two contradicting flows of thought keep me in an endless loop throughout the rest of the classes.\n\nI've had sex with a girl while in a relationship.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nIt's at best a two-week relationship that I'm obsessing over, and therefore I'm overreacting.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nIf that was the case, why did it upset Reed so much? He's acting like I've committed adultery, so it has to be a serious relationship.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nNot once was it stated that this is a SERIOUS relationship, and therefore I'm overreacting.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nMy initial reaction has to be the correct one. After all, I'm literally half of the relationship at hand and should know my feelings best.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nMy feelings can be my turbo autism acting up after years of not having a girlfriend, and if I was normal, I wouldn't take it this hard. Therefore I'm overreacting.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that I've had sex with a girl while in a relationship...\n\nOn and on it goes. My head feels like an infinity symbol. After an eternity of suffering, the final bell rings, symbolizing my freedom to go ahead and fuck my life up even more.\n\nFang said she'd come over to help with my music assignment, but I don't feel like talking to anyone. If it angers Reed, then so be it. I shoot her a quick message, excusing myself. She replies something, but I can't bother to read it. \n\nI just wanna go home, plop onto my bed, and die\u2026"},"Bad Bitch Stella Remastered Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Stella","Bad Bitch Stella Remastered Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"Chapter 3: Follow your heart, they told me...\n\nBack in my shitty flat, I end up lying on my bed and wasting the rest of the afternoon. \n\nIt\u2019s not long before the sun\u2019s set, ushering darkness that mirrors what I feel in my soul. Only once do I get out of bed, and that's to prepare a plate of dino nuggies for dinner. I don\u2019t eat many of them. I can\u2019t bring myself to enjoy the food no matter how much my stomach protests otherwise. \n\nAs the darkness grows outside, I try to think of ways to soothe my nerves other than staring at my ceiling. I consider for a second shitposting the rest of the night away. After the afternoon I had, I can\u2019t even imagine myself being anywhere near clever enough to come up with witty forum replies.\n\nI turn to glance sideways and spot my Xrox. I hadn\u2019t touched it in about three days now. Poor fellow must be feeling so dejected by now. \u2018Well, seeing I have no other idea on how to fucking pass my time tonight...\u2019 \n\nRock Ring it is.\n\nThe mindless nature of shooting eventually brings me some sweet delirium. Before I know it, it\u2019s way past my usual bedtime. If I lived with my parents, they would probably be shouting at me, demanding I get the hell to sleep. One of the benefits of living alone, I guess.\n\nAfter what could have been four hours of zoning the world out with Rock Ring, the events of the day painfully crawl back into my consciousness. Realizing that I have procrastinated long enough, I shut off my Xrox and reach for my phone. Opening up the messaging app, I notice a mixture of chats from Fang, Reed, and Stella.\n\nI hate myself for it, but I only want to hear from one of them. Might as well. I deserve to feel like shit after what I did today.\n\nMy thumb hovers over Stella's name for a long time before I open the conversation. Only one message, no older than from an hour ago.\n\n[Stella]\n\n*going 2 bed. how u doin?*\n\nMy first instinct is to respond with \u2018bad.\u2019 I think about something else to type, but no matter how I rack it, my brain can\u2019t come up with anything else. So with my shoulders sagging in defeat, I type out my reply.\n\n[Anon]\n\n*bad*\n\nI hit send and switch over to the other messages while I wait for Stella to reply. Assuming she\u2019s still even awake at this hour. I first check Reed\u2019s messages. He\u2019s sent me quite a few throughout the day.\n\n[Reed]\n\n*Your classes are over, right?*\n\n[Reed]\n\n*Bro?*\n\n[Reed]\n\n*Hey man, I can't keep Fang here forever*\n\n[Reed]\n\n*Bro!*\n\n[Reed]\n\n*Where are you?*\n\n[Reed]\n\n*K she's gone home*\n\n[Reed]\n\n*Did you talk with Stella?*\n\n[Reed]\n\n*How did it go?*\n\n[Reed]\n\n*Dude, what's happening?*\n\nThe last message was from five hours ago. Reed seems to have given up after that.\n\nNext, I scroll over to Fang\u2019s messages. I hesitate at opening her message. My heart feels like it wants to tear itself out of my chest and beat me up for even daring to think about her after the shit I did today.\n\nBracing myself for the shit emotions I was about to incur on myself, I opened Fang\u2019s messages.\n\n[Fang]\n\n*ye okay i cant come over anyway coz dads a dick*\n\n[Fang]\n\n*ugh im gonna kill reed >:V*\n\n[Fang]\n\n*and naser too*\n\n[Fang]\n\n*how was ur day btw?*\n\nI contemplate sending \u2018bad\u2019 to her too. Then I'd have to explain why my day was so shit, though, and that would lead me to say something that would result in both of us suffering. I consider typing in some neutral-sounding bullshit instead. As I start forming what exact words I should type, Stella's reply arrives.\n\nOnce again, I'm disgusted by how fast I switch over to her from Fang. And yet, there's that unmistakable feeling of excitement in my stomach again, like something\u2014anything\u2014regarding Stella made me feel alive...\n\n[Stella]\n\n*aww!! want me to send something to make u feel better? <3*\n\nDo I? \u201cI don't even know anymore,\u201d I whisper to myself as I bitterly chuckle.\n\nWasting not another second, I type out my next reply with the same desperation of a thirsty man crawling towards water. \n\n[Anon]\n\n*how r u feeling?*\n\n[Stella]\n\n*hot ;)*\n\n[Anon]\n\n*srsly*\n\n[Stella]\n\n*yeh ;)*\n\n[Anon]\n\n*no i mean seriously how are you?*\n\nHalf a second after I hit send, I feel some regret over my question. A part of me dreads what kind of long reply Stella will type out. Knowing her, it might even involve a miniature tarot reading.\n\nTo my surprise, her next reply is short.\n\n[Stella]\n\n*im rewatching gurren lagann, my fav mech shw*\n\n[Stella]\n\n*do u like it?*\n\n\u201cWow... what a pleb,\u201d I find myself whispering. Sure, TTGL had its moments of awesome\u2014like the fight with Lordgenome at the end of the first half, or them activating the moon-sized ship, or the war with the Anti-Spirals near the end, oh, and King Kittan\u2019s glorious dying moment of badassness! I can still hear his final words as he\u2019s disintegrated by the ensuing explosion of his Giga Drill Break...\n\nI pause for a second and laugh to myself. Okay, maybe I was a bigger fan than I thought. \u201cStill, my taste is mecha is ultimately better because I\u2014\u201d I cut myself off as I remember what my current situation was. That was not what I asked her. \n\nCould she be having second thoughts? If so, kinda late for that...\n\n[Anon]\n\n*not what i asked*\n\nI typed out. It takes Stella about a minute to send her reply.\n\n[Stella]\n\n*can I ask u a question?*\n\n[Stella]\n\n*on the roof what did u mean I ruin others lives?*\n\nOh... That. \n\nFuck. \n\nA part of me hoped she had forgotten all about that exchange. I couldn\u2019t blame her for remembering, though. It wasn\u2019t exactly the nicest thing to tell someone who had finished giving you a throat fucking. Hell, even if sex wasn\u2019t involved, it was still a pretty shitty thing to say.\n\nJust like that, I'm feeling like a waste of society again! I\u2019m sure good at eliciting that feeling from myself.\n\n[Anon]\n\n*i didnt mean that*\n\nI type out in the slight hope that my words actually do something other than hurt people.\n\n[Stella]\n\n*really?*\n\n[Anon]\n\n*yes im sorry*\n\n[Stella]\n\n*but then why don't I have friends?*\n\n[Stella]\n\n*why don't I have a boyfriend?*\n\nI have no answer to either of Stella\u2019s questions. I mean, what can I say to her that she doesn't already know? \u2018It's because you're so weird.\u2019 She has to know that. Pretty sure that I've heard Rosa say that to her as well. I'm also sure that I have as well. On many occasions, no less\u2026\n\nI let out a groan flop back on my bed. I have no high ground here. Getting me to cheat on Fang notwithstanding, Stella\u2019s been nothing but pleasant to me up to this point. She even gave me a fucking blowjob, for Raptor Jesus\u2019s sake. You cannot be nicer to someone than giving them a blowjob! \n\nI\u2019m suddenly startled when my phone rings. At first, I\u2019m mortified by the prospect of Fang calling me so late. Had she somehow found out? Was she calling to rightfully lay all kinds of insults on me for being such an asshole?\n\nSwallowing hard, I bring up my phone and ready myself for the hell that was to follow. To my surprise, it\u2019s Stella who\u2019s calling, not Fang.\n\nWith a sigh of relief, I pick up the call and put the phone to my ear. \u201cUh... hey?\u201d I start, careful not to let my previous fears show in my voice. \n\n\u201cHey, Anon. I'm not bothering you, am I?\u201d\n\n\u2018What, like for the last 24 hours? Nah!\u2019 I think, almost forming those words in my mouth before deciding that I shouldn\u2019t be an asshole to the first person I\u2019ve spoken to in hours. \u201cNah. Don't worry about it!\u201d\n\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Stella remarks on her end, almost as if she was about to say something else but then goes silent. My mind then starts filling the silence with images of her fidgeting from side to side or using her free hand to shred a napkin or something similar. It takes me a bit, but eventually, I\u2019m able to catch the sound of her breathing in the background. Maybe it's my mind playing tricks, but I swear that her breaths have a raspy undertone to them, almost like she had just finished crying.\n\nAt the idea of Stella weeping, I feel a block of ice hit my stomach. I didn't know it was possible for me to feel worse, but remembering my outburst on the rooftop makes me wish I was six feet under already. I have no idea how she could take that so calmly. Although maybe she didn't. But still, Stella went out of her way to point out that I need a reality check like she knows how relationships work. Sure, she could have been bullshitting me so I keep her as a side piece, but there seems to be more to it. It's too sudden for her to be all moody and shit after that.\n\n\u201cWhy can't I have friends, Anon? Why am I such a freak?!\u201d Stella shouts at me. Something happened to her, and it probably wasn\u2019t pleasant.\n\n\u2018HOL UP,\u2019 I think as my mind stops to really think about it. Rosa definitely would not have a crying Stella within five feet of her. The only way for Stella to be a crying, shouting mess was if Rosa\u2019s nowhere near to either support or scold the shit out of Stella. That, or Stella isn't in the dorms at all.\n\nDespite knowing that only pain lies that way, I decide that Stella needs a bit of support, even if it comes from someone as shitty and idiotic as me.\n\n\u201cDid you have a fight with Rosa?\u201d I bluntly question Stella. \n\n\u201cH-how did you\u2014Wait, d-did s\u2014she tell you? Is that why you messaged me?\u201d Stella stuttered, her voice barely able to maintain some semblance of comprehension.\n\nI find myself scowling at Stella\u2019s question. \u201cWhat? No. You messaged me first, remember?\u201d\n\nThere is a pause from Stella\u2019s end before I hear what sounds like a gasp. \u201cOh. Right\u2026\u201d she says before going quiet again.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 what happened?\u201d I ask, all the while asking myself why I even cared in the first place.\n\n\u201cI-it wasn't a fight. Not really... Um\u2026\u201d Stella again pauses, and I hear what sounds like a strained and wobbly inhale. \u201c...Some of Rosa's friends came over \u2018cause they were going out for a girl\u2019s night out, and Rosa\u2026 she wanted me to come along, but I didn't want to \u2018cause I didn't want to ruin their fun with my weirdness. Rosa being Rosa wouldn't let it go, and she said something mean and I got mad and said something mean back to her, and then they left and I stayed and I feel soooo bad now!\u201d \n\nIt honestly doesn't sound that bad, and yet... Rosa said something mean to her? That would be a first. Rosa\u2019s usual go-to is the shoe\u2014or \u2018chancla\u2019 as I\u2019ve heard her say a couple dozen times by now\u2014so it had to be something fucked up to get Stella this upset. More so than me telling her to kill herself.\n\nI'm scared to even ask, but I have to know. \u201cW-what did Rosa say to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said that if I don't go, I'll just waste my life watching anime! Like that's a bad thing!\"\n\nI'm certain that my sigh\u2014albeit internal\u2014is powerful enough to get picked up on radar and a few AM radio stations. Then it hits me like a baseball bat to the back of the head. No matter how laughable and trivial it sounded, Rosa had offhandedly confessed to not only not caring for Stella's main area of interest but actively condemning it. That she sees herself better than Stella, who is \u2018just a weeb,\u2019 something I\u2019m willing to bet my left testicle she would never ever let slip. Considering that Rosa seems to be Stella\u2019s only friend, I understand how this could leave a deep wound in the stego\u2019s heart. After all, I\u2019m a firsthand witness to how much she cares about anime. Cringey or not, phase or not\u2014outgrow it she might\u2014for the here and now, it was important to her, and thus it's important to me.\n\n\u2018Wait. What was that last part?\u2019 My mind asks as I run over my previous thoughts. \u2018It\u2019s, uh\u2026 important to Stella. Yes. Important to her.\u2019\n\n\u201cI... see\u2026\u201d I say, not sure how else I can properly word what I\u2019m feeling. \u201cSo uh, what did you say to her?\u201d I ask, only to realize seconds later that it was probably still an extremely sore subject that Stella did not want to relieve in any way, shape, or form.\n\nI wince internally but keep hoping that maybe it was something silly. Instead, I\u2019m met with silence. A long ass fucking silence that slowly starts filling me with dread. When almost a minute passes with only Stella\u2019s strained breathing as her only response, I know that whatever it was, it was terrible enough for Rosa to storm out in a fury. I can\u2019t imagine what would bring such rage from such an ordinarily pleasant and pious girl, but I keep my mouth shut about it.\n\nI\u2019m honestly at a total loss on what to say or do next. I can't make this right or magic up some friends for Stella, not to mention that I should keep my distance because of the whole cheating on Fang with her thing. That last part really makes all this a whole lot more confusing than it needs to be. Like, how can I help someone with whom I cheated on my girlfriend? \n\nI guess the only thing to do now is to make Stella feel better by being friendly, supportive, and DEFINITELY not flirty so that she won't take it the wrong way. Make her know that she matters, nothing more\u2026\n\n\u201cWell, if it makes you feel any better, I totally jerked off to the pics you sent me yesterday.\u201d\n\nWhat. The. Actual. FUCK is wrong with me? Maybe there's a reason why I write drafts before ordering a pizza.\n\nEVASIVE MANEUVERS\n\nDAMAGE CONTROL\n\nDAMAGE CONTROL\n\n\u201cEr, I mean, do a tarot card reading for me?\u201d I meekly ask, hoping to god that Stella didn\u2019t quite catch my last sentence.\n\n\u201cY-you did?\u201d Stella asks me, her voice suddenly filled with renewed vigor that I could practically feel even on the other side of the phone.\n\n\u201cLet's pretend you didn't hear that,\u201d I reply in a futile attempt to dig my way out of the hole I had unearthed for myself.\n\nWHAT WAS I THINKING!\n\n\u201cT-that's... kinda hot, Anon\u2026\u201d Stella says in a sultry tone.\n\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nMORE DAMAGE CONTROL\n\nI let out a feigned laugh. \u201cI'm joking!\u201d\n\n\u201c...Oh,\u201d Stella starts, her tone somehow sounding twice as miserable as before. \u201cS-so... you didn't like them?\u201d\n\nMAXIMUM DAMAGE CONTROL MODE ENGAGE\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I state, all the while laughing as heartily as I can fake it. \u201cNot one bit! Like how could I, right?! They were terrible!\u201d\n\nI hear what sounds like a gasp and the start of a wail as the call abruptly ends.\n\nI blink a couple of times, not quite sure about what had happened. Gradually, my mind starts unfucking itself, and the total weight of my words overwhelms me like a tidal wave of shame. \n\nI drop the phone on the bed and let out a frustrated scream, all the while grabbing the sides of my head. \u201cGreat job, Anon! Now she must think that she's a freak AND ugly!\u201d I shout to the walls. I\u2019m very tempted to punch myself in the face, but I\u2019d have to be drunk, high, or drunk AND high to actually bypass the mental inhibitors preventing me from doing that. Still, the desire doesn\u2019t go away one bit as I bask in my achievement in assholism. \n\nOnce I\u2019ve partially composed myself, I reach out for my phone and try calling Stella back. In my mind, I\u2019m desperately hoping that the call dropped because of a shitty signal. When she doesn\u2019t answer, that hope's shattered. \u2018Well, okay. Maybe Rosa will cheer her up, right?\u2019 I think only to remember that Rosa was off somewhere else and also pissed off at Stella. \u2018Oh, fuck me with a red-hot poker!\u2019 I try calling again, still no answer. My words from the rooftop start echoing in my mind.\n\n*Maybe you should just fucking neck yourself!*\n\n\u201cShe\u2014Stella\u2019s not seriously about to\u2014\u201d I cut off my own words. The mental image of a Stella hanging from one of her room\u2019s support beams pops into my mind, her neck bruised and bloody, her eyes glassed over yet somehow still managing to direct an accusatory gaze at me for what I made her do...\n\n\u201cFuck! What's the time?\u201d I shout as I practically tackle my nightstand to grab my alarm clock. Two in the fucking morning.\n\nI drop the clock and panic. No way buses are running at this hour. I can try running there, but even at a non-stop sprint, it would take me at least half an hour. By that time, it might already be too late to stop Stella from\u2026 \n\nNo, that's too much time! I try the phone again. Once more, my own terrible words echo back to me...\n\n*Maybe you should just fucking neck yourself!*\n\nNot only is there no answer from Stella\u2019s phone, but it seems like she turned it off. That or she blocked me.\n\nIn desperation, I dial the next phone in my mind and hope to Raptor Jesus that I\u2019m able to get her to pick up.\n\nAlmost as if the powers above want to cut me some slack, the call gets picked up almost immediately. \u201cAn-on? What is up?\u201d Rosa asks in a far more positive way than I would expect.\n\nWasting not one single precious second, I lunch into my following words with reckless abandon. \u201cRosa! Please, listen to me! I think Stella's about to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStella? \u00a1Fucking PUTA! \u00a1MALDITA SEA LA MADRE QUE LA PARIO!\" Rosa starts shouting in Spanish with such seething fury that I\u2019m absolutely lost for words. Whatever it was that Stella and Rosa fought about had to be utterly catastrophic...\n\nI grimace as I bring the phone\u2019s receiver closer to my mouth. \u201cYOU'RE NOT LISTENING, ROSA! SHE'S GONNA KI\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u00a1QUE ESA PUTA SE VAYA A LA CHINGADA! \u00a1QUE SE LA COJA EL DIABLO POR EL CULO, CABRONA! PENDEJA! GITANA!\"\n\nIn a rage, I take a deep breath and shout as loud as my lungs will allow, \u201cSHE\u2019S GOING TO KILL HERSELF!!\u201d \n\nMy words completely shut Rosa up, but I can still hear her heavy breathing from the other end of the line. \n\nI take the initiative brought about by the silence to add more to my point. \u201cI tried talking to Stella earlier, but I fucked up real bad. Now I think she\u2019s going to fucking kill herself!\u201d\n\nMore silence before Rosa lets out a shout that causes me to recoil. \u201c\u00a1SE LO MERECE!\u201d\n\nWhen I manage to bring the phone back to my ear, I don't hear anything. \u201cHello? Rosa!\u201d I shout into the receiver fruitlessly. I try redialing Rosa\u2019s number, only for the call to go straight to voicemail.\n\nI punch the nearest wall in frustration, not even caring that I wind up leaving a small dent on the cheap plaster. \n\nFUCK IT\n\nWith no options left, I quickly tap out another number on my phone and press the call button. As I do, I grab my jacket and fly out of my apartment, not even caring if I properly lock the door on the way out. As I head down the stairs and into the lobby, the phone picks up as I think the call wouldn\u2019t go through.\n\n\u201cVolcaldera Taxi service. How can I help ya?\u201d\n\n\u201cH-hello? Yes. I\u2026 I seriously fucked up! There\u2019s not much time left! I\u2019m curr\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGot it, kid. Be there in a sec.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t eve\u2014\u201d I stop talking when my phone announces that the call\u2019s ended. My heart starts racing again as I start typing the number again with shaky fingers. \n\nBefore I can hit the send button, I hear the sound of screeching tires. Seconds later, a familiar taxi pulls up in front of me. Not even caring that the cab had magically appeared in front of me when I needed it most, I race for the back door and basically jump inside.\n\n\u201cHey, if it ain\u2019t my favorite skinnie!\u201d The driver, a familiar yellow velociraptor sporting a wide toothy grin and a very pointy brown mustacheless goatee, greets me. \u201cSurprised when ya called me this late at night,\u201d He added, all the while raising one of his long, bushy, and curly eyebrows. He quickly sized me up, his expression turning dour. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, kid, but ya look real agitated. Everything alright?\u201d\n\nI shake my head in response. \u201cI need to get to Volcano High as fast as you can!\u201d I shout, not really able to keep my cool. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna\u2026 she\u2019s gonna\u2026 gonna...\u201d I put a hand on my eyes as I try to keep myself from crying in frustration.\n\nThe driver doesn\u2019t even wait for me to finish my words as he sets his car to drive and takes off like a bat out of hell. \u201cSay no more, kid. We\u2019re movin\u2019.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m almost too deep in terrible thoughts to notice how fast the taxi\u2019s going. Every few seconds, I try calling Stella, only to meet with an endless amount of ringing. Only when I put the phone down to try and keep my heart from exploding from the fear do I notice how the driver\u2019s driving like he\u2019s on a mission. He\u2019s not traveling down the standard roads. Instead, he opts for back roads and cutting through alleyways, all places where there are barely any traffic lights or stop signs from hindering his momentum. As a result, a trip that would have easily taken ten minutes wind up only being five as he makes one last turn and comes up not in front of the school as I would have expected, but instead only a few meters away from the dorm building itself.\n\n\u201c\u2018Aight skinnie, end of the line,\u201d he says in a serious tone. \u201cBe real careful now, ya hear?\u201d\n\nI again nod and reach into my pocket to fish out whatever cash I had on hand. Before I do, the driver puts up a hand and shakes his head. \u201cYa can pay me later. Just go get her!\u201d he says, all the while motioning with his head. \n\nWasting not another second, I again nod and exit the cab, sprinting the rest of the distance to the dorms. Only when I catch the cab backing up and driving off in my peripheral vision, do I wonder how the driver knew exactly where to go and what my goal was.\n\nI swear, one of these days, I\u2019m going to get some answers from that cabby...   \n\nAs I near the front gates of the building, I notice that there\u2019s no commotion outside. I feel a small wave of relief as I realize that no crowds of sobbing teens mean Stella hasn\u2019t jumped off the roof or anything dramatic like that. That didn\u2019t change the possibility that she killed herself in her room, though. \n\nThe thought pushes me to jog faster. I almost make it inside, too, before someone tackles me out of nowhere.\n\n\u201cNow hold your horses, boy! Where the hell do you think you're going?\u201d A gruff yet surprisingly young voice asks me. I turn to face the source and wind up staring eye to eye with what looks like some kind of purple crocodilian dinosaur. As expected, he wore a black and white guard\u2019s uniform. Yet, the sleeves look ripped to better accommodate some very intimidating muscles. \u201cWe\u2019re closed for the night.\u201d\n\nFuck, I should have known they'd have security... \n\nI try my best to wriggle out of the guard\u2019s grip. \u201cYou gotta let me in! She\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\nThe guard guffaws as he effortlessly picks me off the ground while still managing to keep me in a bear hug. \u201cOh, I'm sure that you\u2019ll be able to work this out with your girlfriend. In the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cSHE'S ABOUT TO FUCKING KILL HERSELF!\u201d I end up frantically shouting as loud as my lungs will allow me. \u201cYOU HAVE TO LET ME IN!\u201d\n\nThe guard stops in his tracks, obviously taken aback by my words. He loosened his grip on me and put me down, but he hovers a hand over his nightstick while keeping me square in his sights. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\nI point to the dorm building. \u201cS-Stella!\u201d I shout, though not as loud earlier. \u201cStella is going to fucking neck herself, you meteor dodging bastard!\u201d\n\nThe guard grimaced as he draws his nightstick out, which he points at my face. \u201cI\u2019m going to ignore that comment about being a meteor dodger, you little twerp,\u201d he says, all the while glaring daggers at me. He looks like he doesn't know whether to break my jaw or throw me right into the bushes. Maybe both, in that order.\n\nI don\u2019t have time to even think of something witty to reply with. Every second now, Stella could be closer to death.\n\nBefore I can say or do anything else, the guard grabs me by the shoulder, digs his claws enough to cause me pain, and shoves me into his security booth. \u201cYou stay put. I'm going to make an announcement. This better not be a fucking joke, you hear me?\u201d He gives me the dead eyes. As if I fucking cared. \n\nThe guard walks up to the console command on his booth and presses a button. Soon as he does, the PA system cracks to life and the guard's voice booms over the empty corridors. \u201cStella! Come to the front entrance immediately!\u201d\n\nI'm left absolutely dumbfounded by the guard\u2019s decision. I set him with a furious glare. \u201cAre you fucking high!? She's not gonna come here if she's dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cWatch your mouth, kid,\u201d he snaps, once again pointing his nightstick at me. \u201cWhat's your name?\u201d He asks in a commanding voice.\n\n\u201cWhat? I\u2014\u201d I cut myself off and grimace. \u201cAnon Mous. My name is Anon Mous.\"\n\nThe guard grunts and returns to the PA one more time. \u201cStella, come to the entrance. Anon is here for you.\u201d\n\nMy heart skips a beat. Oh, that's great. Now the whole damn school will know that I visited Stella\u2019s dorm! I can already imagine the rumors that will spring up from this. Fuck, if it gets bad enough, I might not be able to show my face in public without someone taking the piss out of it. It will be Rock Bottom all over again!\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 I think to myself as I put any and all repercussions that may arise from this. \u2018As long as it means that Stella\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll fucking walk through fiery coals while juggling chainsaws!\u2019\n\nThe guard let out a snort. \u201cFucking teenagers in love,\u201d he whispers with a very soft guffaw. He glances at me and shakes his head. \u201cAnybody ever tell you that you mumble?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t answer. I instead set my full attention to the cameras on the guard\u2019s booth. As nothing seems to happen for almost a full minute, I start getting more and more nervous. I occasionally shoot a glance towards the guard, who, despite his attempts at looking calm and collected, also shows subtle signs of anxiety. With each passing second, my desire to run into the building grows. To hell any kind of law I break. Stella\u2019s life was more important.\n\nThankfully, it doesn\u2019t come to that as Stella\u2019s figure appears in one of the cameras. As I gaze upon the grainy yet very much alive figure of the stegosaur, a tremendous weight lifts off my shoulder. I sniff as I clear some waterworks that have started building in my eyes. \u2018She's okay. She's alive. Thank fuck! I don't even care if I'm getting arrested now...\u2019\n\nThe guard lets out another snort as he stows his nightstick away. Despite his still visible grimace, I can see that his eyes have softened. Perhaps he too was glad that no one was in any immediate danger?\n\nThe guard and I watch as Stella makes her way to the gate in silence. A dozen doors open all over the place, but nobody stops her. Once she gets close enough, the guard motions for me to follow. I'm practically on the crock\u2019s heels. As soon as Stella is through the main gates, I rush up to her, embracing her in the tightest hug I have ever given anyone that isn\u2019t my mother. \n\n\u201cA-Anon? What's going on?\u201d She asks, confusion clear in her voice.\n\n\u201cOh god, oh fuck! You're alright!\u201d I shout, no longer caring that my eyes are overflowing with tears.\n\nStella doesn't know how to respond to my words or actions. I don't fault her for that. Still, she returns the hug, if a bit awkwardly at first. A second later, she tightens her embrace, and I can feel something wet forming on my shoulder. \n\nThe guard clears his throat, at once reminding us where we were and what kind of situation we were in.\n\n\u201cOkay, would either of you mind telling me what\u2019s all this about?\u201d He asks as he crosses his arms.\n\nI let out a sigh, preparing myself to face the music. \u201cI was wrong...?\u201d\n\nThe guard raises an eyebrow at me. \u201cYeah. No shit, Romeo.\u201d He looks at his watch and sighs. \u201cSo here's what\u2019s going to happen next. I'm going to write a detailed report of how a certain skinnie caused a disturbance late at night.\u201d He let out a bit of steam through his nose as he fixed me with a glare. \u201cI\u2019ll leave out some of your more\u2026 colorful language, or the fact that you believed your girlfriend was going to, how\u2019d you put it? \u2018Neck herself,\u2019\u201d he adds with a slightly smug grin that somehow reminds me of Trish\u2019s. I feel Stella uncomfortably shift next to me, but I barely pay it any mind. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely going to talk to Principal Spears in the morning, and he\u2019s not going to be happy about this at all.\u201d\n\nI swallowed hard at that. Tomorrow was going to be hell. In more ways than one...\n\nThe guard turns his attention to Stella next and gives her a stern glower. \u201cWhile I write that report and sort out some other bull, you two take whatever the hell this is up to your room.\u201d He leans down and points a finger to Stella\u2019s face, all the while narrowing his eyes. \u201cNo funny business from either of you or so help me I will make your boyfriend an actual offender in that report. Am I clear?\"\n\nStella and I once again swallow hard. Glancing at each other for a quick confirmation, we then looked to the guard and nod in understanding.\n\nThe guard\u2019s lips rise slightly as he points to the dormitories. \u201cGo. Fix whatever relationship bullshit you two have going on, and don't make a racket!\u201d\n\nWe don't need to hear the guard's command twice. Stella and I booked it back into the building. As we did, I swear I hear the guard once again guffaw to himself...\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nWith the guard\u2019s words still bouncing around in our heads, Stella and I take our walk of shame back up to her room. The stares of the lingering strands of students practically drill holes through us. I'm sure half the school already knows what I've done tonight. The rest will know In the morning, including Fang. That was assuming she didn\u2019t already know from someone like Trish. I bitterly chuckle and think about how much joy that pint-sized terror of a trigger will have rubbing this mess on my face. I can almost imagine her words now: *\u2018See? What\u2019d I tell you? This skinnie was bad news from the start!\u2019* \n\nI roll my eyes at my own imagined image of Trish, even though some part of me knows she\u2019s absolutely right.  \n\nWith a weary sigh, I turn off my phone. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making another mistake, but something tells me not having the device active is the smart thing to do right now. I\u2019m actually surprised the thing hasn\u2019t been going off non-stop. By some minor miracle, all the people that mattered had yet to become aware of my escalating levels of incompetence. Something told me my luck was officially spent.\n\nFrom this moment on, I\u2019m on my own, and it\u2019s time for me to pay the piper...\n\nNeither Stella nor myself speak for the rest of our trek. Not even after we duck into Stella\u2019s room and away from all the other student\u2019s puzzled or annoyed gazes do we exchange a word. As Stella locks her door with a loud click of its mechanism, I\u2019m instantly hit with a level of silence I didn\u2019t think was possible based on the last few hours of my life.\n\nDespite wanting to keep my attention on Stella, I can\u2019t help but look around her room again. A part of me expected to find it almost in the same configuration from two nights prior. Instead, it\u2019s practically unrecognizable.\n\nSure, the dorm wasn't tidy the last time I was there, but now it has shit thrown around everywhere. More clothes, books, cards, linen from both beds. I can even see the side of a laptop jutting out from under a cupboard at an angle that surely isn't within the bounds of \u2018intended use.\u2019 The desks, too, have almost all their shelves pulled out and thrown about. The room looks like it had gotten ransacked by government spooks looking for incriminating evidence. Makes me wonder if this is the result of Stella\u2019s fight with Rosa or if it happened after.\n\nWith no other place aside from the cluttered floor, we sit down on the remains of Rosa's bed. Stella looks awkward and unsure, like a doe suddenly startled by a pair of high-beam headlights. Her hair, her mascara, it\u2019s also a reflection of the room before us. In other circumstances, I would have found her raw, almost primal look appealing, but I keep my mouth shut about such things for the time being. This has got to be about her worst day ever, and the last thing she needs is some horny asshole making her feel any worse. I can't help but notice her cute pajamas, though. The best way I can describe them is \u2018girly.\u2019 Like what a six-year-old would wear, complete with a mosaic pattern of teddy bears.\n\nI'm so lost in the examination that I almost miss her soft voice. \u201cAnon, what is going on? Why are you here?\u201d\n\nWith a deep sigh, I rack my brain for answers. \u201cI, like, when the call\u2014and then when I and Rosa then, so\u2014and I'm here!\u201d I fumble through my words so hard that I can\u2019t help but cringe at my own butchery of the English language.\n\nStella raises an eyebrow and tilts her head to the side. \u201cW-what?\u201d\n\nRight. Let's try that again. This time with less retardation.\n\n\u201cWhen you hung up, I, uh\u2026 I remembered how I shouted at you on the roof\u2026 and that you\u2019re fucked up now, and that Rosa won't be here\u2026 and I thought that you'd, like, want to\u2026 and so then I here but the dude, like, the guard dude wouldn't, and then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnon, stop!\u201d Stella shouts, all the while grabbing my arm and staring into my eyes with her beautiful light blue orbs. \u201cYou're not making sense again!\u201d\n\nI take yet another deeper breath to give it another go. Before I can even speak a single word, Stella stops me, putting a finger over my lips.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 think I get the gist of it,\u201d she whispers, all the while looking away, cheeks turning a shade of pink and her eyes growing slightly shimmery. \u201cI'm... sorry...\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s my turn to look baffled. \u201cWhat?\u201d I say, unable to maintain a calm disposition. \u201cB-but I'm the one that fucked up everything!\u201d\n\nStella lets out a bitter mournful chuckle. \u201cNo, Anon, you didn\u2019t fuck anything...\u201d She shifts her eyes to the side, almost as if she can\u2019t bring herself to look me straight in the eye anymore. \u201cIf\u2026 if it wasn't for me, you would be at home happily sleeping. Hell, you'd probably be with Fang right now!\u201d She sighs, her eyes welling up with fresh tears. \u201cIt's like you said on the rooftop... all I do is ruin others\u2019 lives...\u201d\n\nI open my mouth to utter a protest, but Stella shifts her finger already on my lips and ends up covering my mouth with her hand. \n\nGuess after my eloquent speech, it's her turn to talk.\n\n\u201cYou were right that I shouldn't have... I shouldn't have kissed you a-and\u2026 I shouldn't have done any of the things that I did...\u201d She shuts her eyes tight and lets her built-up tears flow down her face before once again looking me directly in the eyes. \u201cBut I was so happy that I finally found someone that doesn't think anime is a waste of time!\u201d\n\nSomething told me that this wasn\u2019t about anime. At least not anymore... \n\nStella gingerly removes her hand from my mouth and uses it to grab hold of her arm. \u201cI\u2026 knew that you\u2019re with Fang\u2026 but I was so caught up with the idea of finally having a boyfriend that I could talk to and who would care for stuff I care about that I just...\u201d She lets out a strained sob, but as she does, her expression turns warm and caring. \u201cThen that night\u2026 you messaged me, and I\u2026 was so happy!\" She again shuts her eyes and turns away from me. \u201c...But then all that stuff you said on the roof\u2026 I know you took it back, but I knew that you were right. Nobody wants to be my friend, not for real! Even with you, I was...\u201d The dam finally breaks, and Stella lets out a mournful wail as she buries her face in her hands. \u201cI'm such a homewrecker!\u201d she shrieks before burying her face on my chest, her tears and runny mascara leaving a messy stain on my shirt.\n\nI desperately want to interject before Stella gets to the murder-suicide part. Still, something tells me that I shouldn\u2019t interrupt. Like I once did with Fang, this is Stella\u2019s chance at some introspection. The only thing I can do is support her.\n\nWithout thinking, without caring that her words rang true or that a part of me still felt anger at her machinations, I wrapped her in a tight embrace.  \n\nStella\u2019s crying calms a bit as she falls deeper into my hug. \u201cYou still wouldn't want me to\u2026 to go... and you're here now too... and I...\u201d She again locks her exuberant eyes with mine, slowly inching her face closer with every passing second. \u201cI\u2026\u201d she whispers again as our faces come within a single inch of each other. I can't help but sit there, frozen to the core, as she closes the gap between us and presses her strawberry-flavored lips against mine.\n\nThe kiss, same as the last one, starts slow and awkward. But whereas Stella pulled away last time, she now doubles down on it. I can feel a dexterous tongue slither into my mouth, and any resistance I might have had melts right away. Every fiber, every atom of my body, knows how wrong this is. But I don\u2019t care anymore. At that moment, Stella and I were one and the same.\n\nOur hands find each other, and our fingers intertwine. I lay back on the bed, and Stella gets on top of me. The kiss breaks merely so we can get some oxygen. Her hot breath is driving me crazy in a way that I have never experienced in my life. I look into her eyes, and she looks back at me. We both know that we should stop. Hell, that we shouldn't have done any of this, to begin with. But our lives are forfeit already. Soon, the whole school will know of our forbidden relationship. Soon, we will both become social pariahs with no one but each other for company. Our future couldn\u2019t look bleaker, yet as we stared into each other\u2019s eyes, we came to the realization that as long as we had each other, the rest of the world could go fuck itself. \n\nNot a second passes, and we've connected again, silently confirming that there are no breaks on this train. Not anymore.\n\nOur hands drift apart and start to explore all the fun new places. Stella\u2019s scales are smooth to the touch and radiate heat, and once and for all confirming to me that dinos are warm-blooded. It doesn't take me long to figure out that she's not wearing a bra as my hand slowly travels up Stella\u2019s chest, upon which I feel a lump of scaled flesh waiting and eager to be caressed. The sensation is difficult to describe. It feels so lovely and warm. Plump, but with the right amount of perkiness.  \n\nMeanwhile, Stella has settled into a kind of a missionary position. Or reverse missionary. As I continue kissing her and caressing her breast, she starts grinding up a storm against my jeans. My already hard dick only grows harder until my pants start feeling like they are prisons for my manhood. Yet, rather than causing her to slow, the feeling of my dick rubbing against her womanhood drives Stella further and further into lust. It isn't long until her entire nether regions become wet, which shows me that she also didn't have any panties.\n\nWith one final twist of her tongue, Stella breaks our kiss and fixes me with a look of barely restrained lust. \u201cAnon... I want it... I want you...\u201d\n\nOh, sweet merciful Raptor Jesus. That's fucking hot.\n\nShe again swoops down to kiss me, only this one feels deeper than the last. Her tongue once more overpowers mine as she assumes direct control over me in such a way that I cannot\u2014and will not\u2014dispute. The muscles that make up her tongue flick around inside of my mouth as I rub against its underside with my own, reflexively suckling on the invading limb. I\u2019m absolutely shocked at how much longer her tongue\u2019s compared to mine as it not only dances whole musical numbers around mine, but does so in such a way that I don\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m getting a raw deal out of it. By this point, she has taken control, and I\u2019m tagging along for the ride of my life.\n\nStella and I awkwardly break our kiss up so I can take her shirt off. It would have been nice to have a look at her like that, but feeling her bare breasts press up against my chest is its own reward. As she moves to again kiss me deeply, I think about the fact that I\u2019m still fully clothed. \u2018We should get on the undressing me situation,'' I think as I kick my shoes off my feet. \u201cC-could you, um...?\u201d I motion for Stella to move so I can take off my shirt. She tries, but we don't manage it. I can't do it while laying down on the bed like I am.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should\u2026\u201d Stella starts getting off me so I can at least sit up. It\u2019s at that point that I finally get a good look at her boobs. She has two of them. They're green. The right one points to the side a little. \n\nAs I stare at the lime green goddess before me, I can\u2019t help but think of a single phrase to utter: \u201cYou're beautiful\u2026\u201d\n\nStella gazes upon me with her beautiful light-blue eyes. There's unmistakable moisture covering them. They fog up as her cheeks turn a pretty shade of pink. \u201cGet naked already! Geez...\u201d she giggles bashfully. The contrast between her nervous fidgeting against the top-slut-tier blowjob on the roof is day and night. I don't get what's the difference, but I don't mind. Maybe that was \u2018Bad Bitch Stella,\u2019 and this is the real Stella? \n\nWe both end up undressing. Separately. It\u2019s awkward, to say the least. But damn, being naked with a girl is way too exciting. Our faces are so red that you'd think we ran a marathon.\n\nStella returns to me, dropping her panties before straddling me again. Her body, all of a sudden, feels warmer than before, the sensation of the tip of her scales ever so slightly biting into my skin an exciting, alien one. There's unmistakable moisture covering them.\n\nWe lay back again, joined in a slow but passionate kiss. She reaches for my dick, but her hand jolts back as soon as she touches it. Once, twice, three times. In the end, I grab her hand and compulsorily yet gently wrap her fingers around my soldier. Her breath shortens, and every muscle in her body tenses up. It doesn't last more than a second, though, and soon she's lining my dick up with her pussy.\n\nNow it's my body that stiffens, the tip touching the puffy, eager lips of her womanhood. For a fraction of a moment, the sane part of my mind wonders how Stella and I got to where we are now. What choices led two barely functional weebs to a night of unrestrained passion before the shitstorm of their own making?\n\nWhatever the reason, it wasn't important anymore. The only thing that matters now is accepting the feelings we have for one another and finishing this dance...\n\nWordlessly, I move my hands to Stella\u2019s hip for encouragement. She gives me one last look of hesitation, almost as if her own brain is running through the very same thoughts I had finished putting aside. I only stretch up and plant a kiss on her lips as a sign of encouragement.\n\nInstinctively I hold my breath. Stella does the same. Slowly, ever so slowly, she descends. Little by little, my dick enters her pussy. Stella raises her head up to the heavens as she lets out a slow and steady moan.\n\nMeanwhile, I have no idea how to describe the sensation surrounding my little soldier other than \u2018warm.\u2019 Lines from various doujins and smuts flood my mind. Terms like \u2018velvety insides\u2019 and \u2018so hot I'm melting.\u2019 I feel kinda let down; it feels wet and warm, but it's not like I've expected those to be documentaries. Although as she pushes my dick deeper and deeper, it really starts\u2014\n\nYeah, it\u2014\n\nOh. \n\nOh, it\u2014\n\nWOW!\n\n\u201cOhfuckmethisfeelsamazing!\u201d I shout at the top of my lungs as my grip tightens around Stella\u2019s hips, which prompts her to stop with a surprised yelp.\n\n\u201cA-are you okay? I-is this okay?!\u201d she asks, her face so flushed that I'm legit afraid for her brain.\n\n\u201cY-yeah. Is it okay for you?\u201d I ask despite my brain telling me to start trusting with reckless abandon.\n\nStella bites the bottom of her lip and nods but doesn't go any lower than she already was. I pull her into another kiss, and we settle into a lustful yet awkward rhythm. Our movement even out as we get into it, and I risk going in a little deeper into her.\n\nStella suddenly stops and winces in pain \u201cA-ah... F-fuck\u2026\u201d she whimpers as her body once more quakes.\n\nI try backing away, panicked, but she keeps me pinned down. Then I feel it.\n\nAt first, I feel that something weird\u2019s going on down there. Like it got warmer and wetter. I glance down to see what is happening, and then I see it. \n\nBlood.\n\nMy brain freezes. I didn't even consider that Stella could be a virgin like me. Not after that pro of a blowjob she gave me on the roof.\n\nI want to apologize, but somehow I feel like that'd make it worse. There are tears in her eyes now, and she's still trying to gulp the pain down. She's not looking sad about it, however. In fact, despite her obvious discomfort, she gives me a bright, almost grateful smile. She slows to a halt, running her hand through my scalp lovingly. In return, I hug her tightly, careful not to make her hurt more. Her disheveled hair sticks to her face on several spots, mascara running all over the place. Her eyes are still red from crying, though the rest of her face matches in color now. Nothing short of an absolute mess. Still, at that moment, I feel closer to her than to anyone else in the world. I'm not even sure what to think about that, but I do know that I don't want to think about its deeper implications. Not now. \n\nRight now, I'm\u2026 Happy?\n\n\u2018Yeah\u2026 Yeah, definitely!\u2019 I reassure myself. I'm happy to have made Stella happy. Even in an idiotic manner like this. No. It's not even idiotic. Pushing in all the way like in the pornos? Okay, THAT was idiotic. But taking her virginity? No. I'm not regretting that, and I never will. Relationship drama can go to hell!\n\nI can't even comprehend what it must mean for Stella. She's given everything to me, and I'm happy about it. I'm accepting HER, the weird occult-shit-loving tarot-card-reading astrology-believer weeb stego that she is. Can't help but smile at that, like she is. Besides, I've practically already given my life up for her. We're just a couple of idiots, admitting it to each other. Nothing in our lives is more important than the other, not in the here and now. I know that blurting out \u2018I love you\u2019 would probably ruin everything, but I'm not far from saying it. \n\nSadly, the moment doesn't last forever. Her smile drops, rugged breaths testament to the prolonged pain she's enduring. \u2018Must be uh, a good pain, I guess,\u2019 I think in a futile attempt at levity. We stay connected for a bit before she collapses onto me. There's a pitiful attempt on her part to bounce up and down, but she can't keep that up for more than a few seconds. \n\n\u201cUm... Could we... Switch places?\u201d Stella meekly asks, almost as if expecting me to shout at her in anger.\n\n\u201cW-we can stop if\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d she snaps almost in reflex. \u201cI\u2026 I don't want to stop...\u201d\n\nStella gives me a peck on the lips, then gets up. Her stiff, jerky movements show that she's still obviously in pain. She lays down facing upwards, and I get on top of her. We start going at it missionary style, but her face contorts painfully with every one of my thrusts. She tries kissing me again to distract me, but by that point, it\u2019s evident to me that something\u2019s wrong. After about a minute, she gently pushes me away and excuses herself to the bathroom. \n\nI sit on the bed quietly. Whatever lust-induced bravado I had leaves me as I suddenly start feeling like shit. I try not to overthink the situation as I wait for Stella to return to me. Instead, I quickly jack off and finish before wiping myself off from the various body fluids and search for my boxers among the piles of other discarded clothes. When I find them, I quickly put them back on before returning to sit on the bed.\n\nA few minutes later, Stella returns to the bed wearing a pair of fresh panties. She sits down next to me, avoiding eye contact. \u201cI'm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry that I fucked this up too\u2026\u201d she whispers in the most devastated voice imaginable.\n\nI put a hand on her shoulder in a show of support. \u201cHey, it's okay. I'm sorry too. I\u2026 wasn't thinking.\u201d\n\nStella looks me in the eye and gives me a warm, albeit weak, smile. I pull her into a hug, and we lay back on the bed, cuddling. We stay like that for a while, enjoying each other's company.\n\n\u201cEven though we didn't finish... did you at least enjoy it?\u201d Stella asks me guiltily.\n\n\u201cYeah, I did. Did you?\u201d Stupid question, but then again, I wasn\u2019t exactly known for making intelligent inquiries in the first place.\n\nStella giggles very lightly. \u201cYes, actually\u2026\u201d\n\nMore silence between us. At this point, we are only procrastinating on the inevitable...\n\n\u201cAnon\u2026 aren't you going to regret having sex with me?\u201d Stella asks in a meek voice that sounds a few moments away from breaking.\n\nI embrace Stella tighter. \u201cThat's tomorrow talk. Right now, let's enjoy this moment, okay?\u201d\n\nStella buries her head into my chest. \u201c... okay\u2026\u201d she whispers somberly. I pull her even closer to me, cradling her head under mine. \n\nNo more words\u2026 \n\nJust the sound of silence\u2026\n\n \n\n***\n\nThere is a thunderous set of bangs on Stella\u2019s door.\n\n\u201cWHAT\u2019S GOING ON IN THERE! STELLA! STELLA!?\u201d Rosa\u2019s voice shouts as loud as she can from the other side of the door.\n\nStella and I spring alive. We look at each other and then back to the door. Collectively, we swallow hard.\n\n\u2018Oh, will this night stop FUCKING ME IN THE ASS ALREADY!?\u2019 I find myself thinking in a fury.\n\n\u201cAnon, I didn\u2019t peg you for someone who enjoyed a good pegging,\u201d Stella adds in a vain attempt at levity. I fix her with a raised eyebrow stare, which causes her to shrink a bit. \n\n\u201cYeah, not helping. Sorry.\u201d\n\nThe door once more erupts into knocking, the fiery dino on the other side spewing a stream of curses in her native Spanish.\n\nThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m fucked...\n\nStella\u2019s fucked... \n\nWe\u2019re fucked\u2026"},"Bad Bitch Stella Remastered Chapter 4.txt":{"path":["Stella","Bad Bitch Stella Remastered Chapter 4.txt"],"text":"Chapter 4: Reforging The Link\n\nI wake in a bed that isn't my own, in a strange place I barely recognized, beside another person that's equal parts a stranger and familiar to me.\n\nIt takes me a few seconds to recollect the events that have transpired. Memory is hazy at first, but gradually, the memories flood back in. The calls, the panic, the rush of emotion, the sudden acceptance of lust and love. That last part puts me on alert, forcing my still zoned-out brain to work double to decipher what it could mean. When I, at last, put it together and the memories form a coherent film of recollections, I'm filled with nothing but dread.\n\nWell, 'dread' is not quite the word I'd use. There is a persistent rebellion lighting up inside my soul. It's a war over what's my fault, what isn't my fault, and what I'm willing and unwilling to take the blame for\u2026 and the biggest part of me isn't willing to take it anymore .\n\nWith the feeling of Stella's warm body in my arms and the harsh coldness of my crimes in my head, I am no longer able to tell right from wrong. Was it really wrong of me to cheat on Fang? Yes, it was. I can not\u2014I WILL not\u2014hold anyone else responsible for that fuck-up.\n\nWas it right of me to come to Stella in her time of need? Yes. Yes, it was. Who else could have done it? Hell, who else WOULD have done it? Even if her life ultimately wasn't in danger and it was all my stupid imagination overreacting, with all her friends gone and all her pride crumbled to dust, she was about to go down a dangerous road. People could say all they want about me and how I'm the biggest asshole of them all. People can screech and moan and fling their shit all they want about how big of a mistake this whole thing was. I will never be ashamed of stepping out of the mass of apathy I've been living in and stopping a disaster before it could happen, especially after what I've had to live through in the past. Even if it will cost suffering of my own, it might be the only genuinely right thing I've done in my entire life; the only thing that mattered.\n\nI strengthen my hold on Stella's being. I don't want to let her go...\n\nI know that I've done things that are unforgivable under any circumstance. I've had ample opportunities to come clean with Fang. I had plenty of chances to call it off and walk away before things went off the rails. Yet, I didn't. I couldn't trust Fang to know the truth, and I couldn't share the burden with her even though, as lovers, we're supposed to support each other through thick and thin. 'Till death do us part, and whatnot,' I bitterly reflect. For a second, I entertain the notion that I was sparing Fang the pain. That's such a blatant lie, though. I push it away immediately.\n\nNo. I\u2014and only I\u2014am responsible for deciding to go through this alone. I might have asked Reed's help but ultimately let him down too, even when he risked his neck for me as a real bro would.\n\nMy hands curl into fists. I'm unsure if it's from anger or disgust. Maybe both? Could be resentment. Resent at the fact that after coming such a long way, I am still the same cynical, untrusting retard that's afraid to let anyone close in on things that actually matter. The act of helping someone with her homework or playing the guitar with her\u2026 those pale in comparison to my unquestioned willingness to STILL consider each fight a fight of my own. That I cannot turn the 'me' to 'us' in the phrase: 'Me against the world.'\n\nThis cannot continue...\n\nBefore I could further the thought, there is a thunderous set of bangs on Stella's door.\n\n\"WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE!?\" Rosa's voice shouts as loud as she can from the other side of the door.\n\nI jolt upright, causing Stella to wake up as well. She lets out a cute little yawn and rubs her eyes. \"W-what time is it?\" she innocently asks, almost as if not recognizing where she is or with whom she is currently laying.\n\nAnother set of hard knocks threatens to knock the door off its hinges. \"STELLA! STELLA!? \u00a1Abri esta puerta ahora mismo, o juro en el nombre de Raptor Jesus que la voy a Derribar!\"\n\nOn hearing Rosa's words, Stella fully springs awake. Almost as if going through my previous thoughts, just in super-fast motion, she looks around, looks at me, has her face go from joy to sorrow, to worry, and ultimately to shit-panting fear before grabbing me by the shoulder.\n\n\"It's R-Rosa!\" She half-yells as she gives the door another look, almost as if to verify that she wasn't seeing or hearing things.\n\nWhen there's a third set of hard knocks, we look to one another in sheer terror, the same thought flashing through both of our minds:\n\n' GET FUCKING DRESSED! '\n\nStumbling out of bed\u2014Rosa's bed, by the way\u2014Stella and I try gathering up our respective articles of clothing. Unfortunately, due to all the other pieces of clothes tossed around the room, what should have been an easy task becomes nothing short of a nightmare. Stella dives for the nearest bra in her sight and rapidly puts that on. I practically do a tactical drop and slide for what I believe are my socks. As I do, I chance a glance towards Stella, only then noticing that the bra she's wearing seems to be a bit bigger than her breasts. The things also have what look like a floral pattern to them...\n\nI don't think much about that as I slip one of my socks on. Meanwhile, Stella has found and is actively putting on what I can only really call her booty shorts. I look down to put on my other sock, except that it's white with blue stripes, unlike my plain black socks. With a mismatched sock in my hand, I turn to Stella. \"Hey,\" I say in a hushed yell. \" I think this one's yours!\"\n\nStella looks at me first, then at the sock. She motions to me that, yes, it's hers. \"Help me put it on!\" she tells me while also looking around for the other one. I try\u2014I honest to god try\u2014but with her leg moving all around, it's not an easy operation by any means.\n\nOne final set of knocks, and I hear the unmistakable sound of jingling keys.\n\nOH, THAT'S IT\n\nI'M DEAD\n\nWE'RE DEAD\n\nGoing by my luck, Rosa might as well have Fang in tow. The police too, ready to register me as an offender. Hell, Naser and Mr. Ripley can join that party too. Then it would be the end of the line.\n\nWe freeze, my hand still grabbing Stella's leg. Despite every desire to duck and hide away, we both know what's coming is inevitable. So we just stay there, awaiting the inevitable...\n\nExcept nothing happens.\n\nNo. Something does happen. It's not what we expected. What sounds like a bit of commotion resonates from the other side of the door, and another familiar voice joins the fray.\n\n\"Rosa! Hey Rosa, wait!\" a voice that's all too familiar to me rings out, barely muffled by the door. \"Don't go in!\"\n\nMy brain freezes. I refuse to believe it. 'I-is that Reed? What's he doing here?' I think as I try to get my body and brain to resume their functions. 'After all that I've done, why is he...?'\n\nI don't have much of a chance to finish those thoughts as Rosa shouts her following words at Reed. \"Why wouldn't I do that, pendejo?!\"\n\n\"Cause it's, uh... it's a hotbox!\" Reed lies through his teeth.\n\n\"A 'hot box?' What the hell is that?\"\n\nFirst, I have no idea what Reed is talking about, but then it hits me square in the chest. 'A distraction!' I almost shout my thoughts, though by the look Stella gives me, I'm pretty sure I mumbled it. Reed knows I'm here, and he's rerunning interference. Though I don't honestly know how much luck he'll have with Rosa, every second he buys me is another second I come closer to giving the guy a kiss. On the lips. Full tongue and everything.\n\nI shake off the shock and return to helping dress Stella. While I find my own pants quickly enough, it takes us a second to find anything else. I then spot one of her shirts\u2014what looks to be her 'Oppai' shirt from the concert\u2014and grab it, swiftly bringing it up to her. She takes one look at the shirt and gives me a worried look. I motion with my head at it, and she hurriedly nods. Wasting not one second, I slip the shirt over her head, at which point she finishes putting it on. Only when the shirt is over her body, do we both realize that it\u2019s on backwards.\n\nStella furrows her brow at me. I ignore it and pick up another sock to put on her foot. 'Wait, is that different from the other?' I ask myself, as I realize that the new sock in my hand is yellow with pink stripes. 'NO MATTER! NO TIME!' I practically shout to myself as I secure my own pants in place.\n\nThinking quickly, I look around for my shirt. Stella shoots me a quick whistle, and I turn around in time to catch a shirt tossed to my face. Now it's my turn to furrow my eyebrow at Stella. Her response is only to giggle. Meanwhile, fragments of the conversation between Reed and Rosa hit my ears.\n\n\"But bro, we can't let the smoke out, or Stella's gonna get banned from the dorms!\"\n\n\"\u00a1No me importa!\" she shouts, the sound of keys once again resonating like the toll of a death bell.\n\nWhile putting my shirt on, the door's mechanism clicks, and it swings open.\n\nRosa first looks at me, then to Stella, then around the room, then to Stella again, and finally back to me, at which point her crimson eyes lock onto me. It takes her a second to register all the information. Her eyes fill with what I assume to be rage, but before she can do or say anything, Reed acts first.\n\n\"Sorry about this!\" he yells as, to my absolute disbelief, he puts Rosa into a chokehold from behind.\n\nReed's face contorts as he tries his best to hold back Rosa, who is fuming, her nose erupting steam as she tries to free herself from Reed's grip. Reed, for his part, contorts his face into a scowl of concentration as he tries his best to drag Rosa back into the hallway, likely in an attempt to shove her out and then shut the door. His struggle, however, seems to be costing him a lot more stamina than he anticipated, his muscles simply being no match for the muscled and very angry orange ankylosaur in his grip.\n\nFor the faintest of seconds, it looks like Reed might win the struggle, as Rosa's flushed face begins to turn a shade lighter. But that quickly changes when in what I can only consider being brilliant, she stomps her foot on Reed's left foot, causing him to loosen his grip. Taking the opportunity of the opening she created, she jabs the velociraptor in the chest with her elbow, forcing Reed to release the orange dino with a loud grunt from his part. She then slams a foot down and takes what almost looks like a horse stance. With a mighty punch to his sternum, Reed's sent flying back into the hallway, where he hits the opposite wall first, followed by the cold hard ground. He lets out a strained gasp as he grabs his abdomen before coughing and wheezing in an attempt to get air back into his lungs, all the while sticking his tongue out and gagging, no doubt trying desperately to hold back whatever he had for dinner last night from staining the floor.\n\nWith a snort from her snoot, Rosa turns away from Reed, almost like how a martial artist would turn away from their defeated enemy. I almost expected the pink velociraptor to explode in a shower of sparks and colored dust like this was a super sentai. Of course, this was fucking real, and the situation was far too dire for me to dwell on such thoughts. If anything, the only thing that came to mind was how much I would end up owing to Reed\u2026 assuming he still wanted to talk to me after this was all over.\n\nRosa stepped back into her room and once again fixed me with a glare, her eyes filled with absolute disbelief at what they were witnessing. \"An-on, what is happening here!? Why are you taking your clothes off!?\"\n\n'Wait, off?' I ask myself as I glance down towards my compromising position, shirt raised, exposing my abs and part of my back. My eyes naturally snap wide as the implication hits me full force. 'Oh god, she thinks that we were about to fuck!'\n\nI want to speak up, but my tongue is as frozen as the rest of my body. Thankfully, Stella, bless her anime-loving soul, speaks up for me.\n\nBut before she can say her words, a terrible thought hits me. 'Please Stella, don't say what I think you're gonna say,' I think as the stego's words leave her mouth.\n\n\"This isn't what it looks like!\"\n\nIf I wasn't frozen in fear, I would have facepalmed. 'Oh goddammit, Stella. Why did you have to default to such a tired and overused clich\u00e9?' I ask myself. Then again, it was true. Just not in the way Rosa expected. Did that make it an anti-clich\u00e9 then? Fuck, that's a question for when I'm not about to get gored by a very angry ankylosaur.\n\nForcing my body to move, I finish putting my shirt on but can't otherwise add anything to the situation. I'm half tempted to try and bullshit something out, but there honestly was nothing I could add that wouldn't make the situation seem any less compromising. Though I'm at least thankful that the ankylosaur didn't catch us naked. Otherwise, I'd probably be a stain on the wall or something...\n\nI hear a loud hack ring from the hall, and much to my surprise, I see Reed crawling back in through the door, all the while clutching onto his ribcage with a pained, strained look in his eyes.\n\n\"Geez Rosa, I think you broke my ribs\u2026\" he whimpers through ragged breaths. He, too, looks around and at us, his expression still one of barely contained pain. Though when his eyes fix themselves on mine, he gives me one stare of pity and disbelief. That honestly hits me harder than any insult or reprimand he could say to me.\n\nRosa pays Reed little mind. Her full attention instead is on Stella and me. With a glare that is one level below, 'I'm going to use your head as a horn ornament,' she crosses her arms and starts tapping her foot. All things considered, she's handling the current development shockingly well. She isn't shouting any of the insults she tossed my way back when I called her in a panic, and she hasn't yet moved to beat the living crap out of Stella. \u2018 Maybe she's calmed down significantly since last night? ' I ask myself, hopeful that maybe no one else aside from Reed was going to get hurt...\n\nDespite what must have been a great deal of pain, Reed manages to stand up. As he does, I spot some tears in his eyes. If his ribs are as damaged as he claims, then the fact that he's even standing is proof of how tough the velociraptor is. That, or how high he is on carfe. Whatever the case was, the moment he's caught his breath and obtained an even footing, he closes the door sealing the four of us into the room.\n\n\"D-dude, out with the truth now,\" he whimpers as he nurses his chest. \"Fang's on her way here!\" he croaks, a tear rolling down his cheek.\n\n\"I would also like an explanation. Now!\" Rosa interjects, her glare never leaving either Stella or myself.\n\nReed's and Rosa's words are simple, and their words are right. And yet, all they do is evoke that ever-growing rebellion inside me. A dam can only hold so much water.\n\nI give one last weary sigh, then with determination in my eyes, I speak, addressing both Rosa and Reed. \"Sit down, the both of you,\" I say, motioning to the people who may soon no longer be my friends for entirely justified reasons.\n\nRosa walks up to the nearest overturned chair and sets it upright. She then takes a seat, arms still crossed and frown still very present. Reed, meanwhile, drops down on his rear, taking a relaxed pose on the floor. Judging by his twisted look of pain, breathing is enough to cause him agony. It makes me worried that his original assumption about his ribs is correct. The last thing I want is for the new day to start with one of us having to go to a hospital.\n\nWith Rosa and Reed seated, I feel confident enough to begin my tale of deception, infidelity, and stupidity...\n\nWhat follows is my recollection of the past thirty-two hours. I tell them about the bet and the wager. I tell them about watching SAO with Stella and her sudden kiss. I tell them about how confused and damned I've felt about it, and I tell them how I couldn't stop myself from messaging her that night.\n\nWith a slight pause to catch my breath, I continue telling them about what happened next and the guilt I've felt over it. I tell about my sharing the secret with Reed, turning him into my accomplice, and I tell the shame of the rooftop encounter, sparing no detail, from the moment Naser and Naomi both came into the scene, to how their impromptu rooftop 'fun' forced me to very unorthodoxically shut Stella up.\n\nThat last part got a wide-eyed reaction from both Rosa and Reed. I don't think I've ever seen either dino's eyes go that wide in shock. The responses that followed were as telling of how they were feeling. Rosa looked like she wanted to faint. Reed's expression, meanwhile, was a combination of terror, disappointment, and sadness, all emotions overriding his look of pain. I couldn't blame the guy. If I were in his shoes, I probably would have the same expressions on my face...\n\nMoving past the roof, I tell about my doubts, and I speak about my turmoil. I tell it all, and I tell it true. When it comes to the events that took place last night, I hesitate. How can I say to my friends that I broke the one sacred rule about relationships? That I spat in the face of Fang's trust for me?\n\nStella, who's been mostly silent up to this point, suddenly stands up. \"Anon\u2026 L-let me\u2026\" She seems hesitant at first, but after taking a deep breath, her expression changes to one of determination. \"Let me tell it from here onward,\" she demands in a feat of courage that I didn't even know she had in her.\n\nI give her a look, pleading with my eyes for her to reconsider. She only gives me a warm smile and a soft look with those beautiful light-azure eyes of her as she takes my hand in hers. \"It's okay, Anon,\" she coos softly. \"It's my turn to bear some of the burden\u2026\"\n\nFor the next five minutes, Stella tells things from her point of view, retreading some spoken ground but generally adding a new viewpoint that completes what I\u2019ve said already.\n\nThen Stella gets to my arrival the night prior, and she too hesitates. I feel her hand grip mine tightly as her expression hardens. \u201cAnon and I\u2026 we decided we were done hiding what we felt for each other. We\u2026\u201d She bites the bottom of her lip and lets out a sigh. \u201cWe kissed again, only this time as true lovers\u2026 and we fell asleep in each other\u2019s embrace\u2026 At least until we woke up, and I decided to take it beyond just kissing and hugging...\u201d\n\nI slowly drop my head. A mixture of relief and guilt surges through me. On the one hand, I was relieved that Stella didn\u2019t mention our sex session to Rosa or Reed. I can\u2019t imagine the type of shitstorm that would cause between us.\n\nOn the other hand, did Stella\u2019s denial of losing our virginities to each other imply that she found it such a despicable act as not even to be worth bringing up? Had I been such a bad partner in bed that she\u2019d rather forget it ever happened? Or worse yet, did she regret it ever happening?\n\nBefore I can dwell more on those last dark thoughts, I hear Stella let out a sigh. I turn my head up in time to see the lime-yellow dino fix her roommate with a pained stare.\n\n\"R-Rosa,\" Stella starts, stuttering a bit when calling her friend's name. \"I\u2026 I need to apologize\u2026 for the things I told you last night\u2026 I shouldn't have ever said any of them to you\u2026\u201d\n\nRosa's upper lip stiffens, but she doesn't say anything to Stella.\n\n\"The things I told you\u2026 I-I\u2026\" Stella grabbed hold of her arm, her tail flopping down and staying absolutely still. \"I was in a horrible place last night. I\u2026 I just had so many pent-up feelings! So much gnawing at me! It was too much. Too much!\" She half-closes her eyes and lets out a single sniff, glancing down in my direction.\n\nInstantly, I felt ice in my gut. I knew where Stella was going next\u2026\n\n\"Someone told me some truly awful things. Things that while I wanted to deny desperately, I knew deep down were in fact true\u2026\" She gripped her hands shut and turned back to Rosa. \"It made me realize how many people think of me as a freak, as a weirdo, as someone whose interests are wrong and heretical and downright misguided !\" She grabs my hand again and tightens her grip. I can feel her trembling as emotions she hadn't let out for maybe years bubbled deep in her heart. Knowing that this is Stella's chance to pour her heart out, I return the grasp on her hand in a show of silent support. While her eyes remain as fixed on Rosa as they've ever been, my action makes the corners of Stella's mouth rise ever so slightly.\n\n\"F-for years now, I've felt like an outcast! For years, I've lived my life without any people I can call my friends! In every relationship I've ever had, I've had to try and adapt to fit in the eyes of others, always keeping what I love distant, always having to settle for being what I'm not! Even with you, Rosa\u2014the one person I could almost call a true friend\u2014I've had to pussyfoot around what I love because everything I do is something you disapprove of !\" She let go of my hand and took several steps forward, coming almost face to face with the orange ankylosaur. \"And then last night\u2026 you said all those terrible things about the stuff I love, about the stuff that makes me who I am\u2026\" Her expression darkens as she glares daggers at Rosa. \"Y-you broke my heart!\" she shouted, all the while pointing a finger in Rosa's face. \"You ripped it to pieces like those Duel Monster cards I showed you two years ago!\"\n\nRosa, at first, remains as stoic as she has been for the last few minutes. At first, I'm almost convinced that she's so convinced of her righteous position in this situation that she can't bring herself to feel anything for someone who cheated with another woman's boyfriend.\n\nYet, little by little, I see cracks begin to form in the orange dino's expression. It starts with her shifting her gaze to the side, followed by her lower lip quivering ever so slightly, which is then compounded upon by her previously held cross arm pose losing some of its strength. Whereas before Rosa held her shoulders back and showed a sense of authority, her shoulders began to slack little by little until her previous pose was less imposing and more defensive.\n\nStella turns away from Rosa before she has a chance to notice the more subtle signs of her victory, once more looking me in the eyes. As soon as she does, she yet again smiles, her cheeks flushing a light pink as her eyes begin to shimmer. Only, her smile this time isn\u2019t warm. Rather, it\u2019s filled with bitterness that breaks my heart. \"I\u2026 I know that what I did with Anon was wrong. I know that he's already loved by someone else, and he, in turn, loves them with all his heart\u2026 but I\u2026 I couldn't let it go\u2026\" She closes her eyes and turns away from me, instead opting to face the empty part of the room. \"I was so desperate to find someone like me, someone who understood and cared and shared all that I love\u2026 that I became blinded to the truth\u2026\" she again grabs her arm before turning back to face Rosa, Reed, and myself. \"I was so desperate to find someone who loved me that I crossed a line I should never have crossed\u2026\"\n\nStella closes her eyes and lets out another sigh, the tears from before now freely flowing down her cheeks. \"I have no excuses... but I won't say that all I did was wrong,\" she says, her words, though directed primarily at Reed and Rosa, easily applicable to me as well\u2026\n\nRosa and Reed take all of the words spoken by Stella and myself in a mute stupor. They look at each other as if trying to find some wordless answer in each other's eyes and then back to us. Nobody breaks the silence. It lingers between us for a good while, to the point that I start to worry that we've all gone mute.\n\nIn all honesty, I can't blame either Rosa or Reed for their lack of words. Aside from justifiable anger, what more was there for them to tell us? How much had we fucked up? That was clear for anyone to see. How much in the wrong were we for letting things go so far? Again, pretty damn clearly out in the air\u2026\n\nSuddenly, another set of knocks comes from the door. Unlike Rosa's, they are softer and almost seem hesitant. I look at Reed, who gives me a soft, sad look. His reaction gives me a pretty good idea as to who is now knocking at the door...\n\nAn icy hand claws into my gut. With my emotions spent, all that remains is the guilt.\n\nStella walks back up to me and grabs me by the hand. A small gesture, but the feeling of her hand on mine brings me a strange comfort. I give Stella a quick glance and notice that she too shares my same expression of fear. I tighten my grip, which causes her to shoot me a quick simper, almost as if wordlessly telling me that everything would be alright despite the two of us knowing full well that things were as far away from 'alright' as they could be...\n\nRosa, at last letting her cross-armed pose altogether drop, lets out a broken sigh that sounds closer to a sob. With one look of sadness at Stella and myself, she gets up from her chair and walks up to the door. She puts her hand on the handle but hesitates for a moment. Maybe it's my eyes playing tricks on me, but I swear I see her mouth moving, silently mouthing the word 'perdoname' towards Stella before turning the handle and opening the door.\n\nOn the other side of the door stood none other than Fang, in a way that I've never seen her. Unsure. Tentative. She was clutching onto one of her arms, looking in our direction meekly, but more so at the floor. There's no need to ask questions. She heard our confession. She walks at a slow pace, her expression one of misery. The moment she's inside, Rosa closes the door behind her as if it was an omen. Nailing the coffin shut for myself and Stella.\n\nFang continues her slow and steady walk until she's standing right before me. The whole time, her eyes were set to the ground, almost as if looking up would somehow cause her physical pain. Then again, if she had heard everything, then she likely was doing everything in her power to not scream at me or strangle me, both things that I knew well I deserved. It takes her almost a full minute before she finally finds it in herself to look me in the eye. There are no tears, but her gaze screams the kind of pain that would bring a man to his knees. She's been betrayed by none other than me, the one person she could put her faith, her trust in. A trust that I've gone ahead to throw away brazenly.\n\nThere are no words between us. Fang doesn't ask me if this is a joke or if I even loved her in the first place. She doesn't blame me. She doesn't shout at me. She doesn't raise her first to strike at my face or prepare her boot to kick me in the balls. To her, I'm now a part of a painful past; another object trophy to remind her never to trust anyone again. Whatever justification I've had towards the fling with Stella, none of that seems to matter now. Even if I did save one life, I've ended another. I picked her up, and then I let her down in the worst way imaginable.\n\nA part of me, some sick and depraved part that can't fathom the gravitas of the situation, wants to apologize. I know it's all so pointless now, like walking up to your neighbor with a bloodied bag and telling them, 'hey, I shot your dog, but you can keep the body !' I don't imagine there's any combination of words in the English language that would help me in this situation. Though I'd be more than willing to speak them for Fang's sake\u2026\n\nA few seconds after staring deep into my eyes, Fang turns to face Stella, whose hand I'm still holding onto like a child would hold their mother's. The two women lock eyes with each other, and there's a wordless back and forth between them, one that I cannot fathom nor comprehend. Who could Stella be looking at, I wonder\u2026 Fang or Lucy? And who does Fang see, a freak of a homewrecker or another soul to save? Her expression is unchanging. Stoic, save for the pain in her eyes. On the other hand, Stella is fidgeting around nervously, on the verge of tears, but not willing to back down in the slightest.\n\nWhat an absolutely terrible situation to be in. If I somehow manage to save myself and stay with Fang, Stella loses everything. She won't just be that weird anime-obsessed and occult-loving loner anymore; she'll be condemned for possibly her whole life, truly alone as everyone she's ever known abandons her, her life spiraling further and further into bleakness. But if Stella wins me over, Fang also loses something precious as she too falls into despair. Regardless of who wins, it doesn't change the fact that Stella and I are a horrible couple of cheaters. A perfect pair almost made in hell.\n\nAlmost\u2026\n\nFang's silent inspection of Stella continues for a bit. She turns away from us, sitting down on an overturned table, away from everyone in the room. As soon as she's seated, she sets her eyes to the floor and cradles her hands in her lap. After a few more seconds, she lets out a ragged and weary sigh.\n\nAlmost another minute passes in unbearable silence before she finally speaks, her voice soft, barely audible.\n\n\"I knew something might be up\u2026\" she whispers as she turns to face Reed. \"Yesterday, when you kept me from classes\u2026 I knew something had happened 'cause you'd never put any effort into one single thing otherwise\u2026\"\n\nReed looks like he's about to open his mouth to speak some kind of rebuke, but he ultimately shuts his snout up and looks away from Fang, scowling, his eyes turning hazy, and his cheeks growing rosy. He probably didn't consider that he'd be the one to raise a suspicion in Fang. He can't be blamed, though. He has been more than helpful. Although that might even make it worse for him, that he chose to side with a confessed cheater and liar rather than his friend\u2026 and that all his work and sacrifice was for nothing\u2026\n\nI feel a pang of pride that my girlfriend is so sharp and clever. That pride quickly turns to a spike of pain, however. I cannot claim to be Fang's boyfriend anymore. Not even her friend, probably.\n\nJust the thought makes me wish I was dead\u2026\n\nFang lets out another sigh. \"I had a lot of suspicions, but I would never have imagined that\u2026\" She shakes her head and turns to face Stella again. \"Is it true what you said? Do you really need Anon?\" Fang asks, all the while rising from her improvised seat and taking a step forward, her expression, at last, changing away from her previous pain to a look of determined urgency. \"Do you love HIM?\" she snapped in a tone that didn't quite sound like anger but still carried the same level of gravitas.\n\nAll eyes in the room widened in response to Fang's question. How could anyone not, considering it was not at all what anyone had expected to hear from the ptero.\n\nFang's brow furrows when she hears no answer from Stella. In response, she practically lunges at the stego, only instead of tackling her into the ground and beating the ever-living shit out of her like any other rage-filled girl who had gotten cheated on would, she grabbed her by the shoulders. She fixed her with a dire, pleading look, all the while Stella shifted her eyes away, as if physically unable to look at the ptero in the eye.\n\n\"DO YOU LOVE HIM!?\" Fang shouts right into Stella's face, her eyes finally welling with tears.\n\nStella's stunned at first. Much like earlier, she's frozen in place, seemingly unable to formulate coherent thoughts or emotions. It takes her a full ten seconds before she blinks in confusion and an extra five for a shiver to visibly run up her spine and into her head.\n\nStella shuts her eyes and lets out a weary, broken sigh. Her grip on my hand tightens at first, but gradually, she loosens it until she lets go. The moment she does, she opens her eyes and locks eyes with Fang. She tries to maintain a straight and dignified expression. Still, little by little, the intensity with which my girlfriend\u2014or rather ex-girlfriend, I should say\u2014gazes into her soul gradually wears away at whatever defenses she might have erected for herself.\n\nFinally, Stella takes a step back, breaking away from Fang's grip on her arms. Either not noticing it or taking the tumble willingly, Stella falls back on Rosa's bed. She accepts the fall, almost as if expecting to find some sort of resolution at the end of it. She doesn't even arch her back as if fighting back her very body's survival instincts. Had there been no bed there, she would have hit the ground head first, almost as if\u2026\n\nI shut my eyes and try not to think about the implications. Other thoughts enter my mind instead. A part of me wants to be anywhere in the world but here. Yet, that part is so insignificant to me now that it\u2019s barely worth even acknowledging. It doesn\u2019t want to go out quietly, though. It thrashes about, desperately clinging to whatever relevance it still has. It reminds me of how uncertain my life is. It flashes memories of my broken and shambled life. It taunts me with the fact that in almost every conceivable way, I\u2019m a failure not even worth acknowledging...\n\nI almost give in to the dark thoughts when something else comes in and smacks away all those thoughts. A new thought in the shape of a giant mecha made of light and awesome, its helm is none other than Stella, a radiant smile on her lips, and a hand outstretched towards me, beckoning me to join her in the light so that we may burst through all boundaries and pierce the heavens as one.\n\nAt that moment, I realize that the one person whose thoughts I care to know the most at that moment in time is Stella.\n\nOnly Stella...\n\nMy eyes snap open when I hear the sound of crying. I follow the noise and find myself looking at Stella, hands over her face, legs tucked up almost in a fetal position, and her body rocking back and forth, her tail, which usually wrapped around her leg wherever she demonstrated some kind of overwhelming emotion, flopping beside her as if it had gone numb.\n\nI glance towards Reed and Rosa in an attempt at gauging their moods. Rosa remains as stunned looking as before, her eyes wide and trembling, and her whole body limp, almost as if she fainted while still being wide awake. Reed, meanwhile, is a little easier to read. He's just plain flabbergasted, his jaw still hanging limply, and his body slumped down in a mixture of physical pain and mental exhaustion. I honestly couldn't tell which of the two was causing him more distress.\n\nI then look towards Fang. Her hands are clenched tight, and she's gritting her teeth, the scowl on her face leaving little in the way of deciphering other than rage. Yet, she wasn't glaring at Stella or me. Instead, she was looking down at the floor, almost as if she couldn't bear to look at Stella's wailing\u2026\n\nIt takes Stella a full minute before she exhausts all her tears. When she, at last, sits up on the bed, she kneels before fixing Fang with a pleading, almost puppy-like gaze. She opens and closes her mouth several times as if words are trying to be said, but just as quickly getting killed before they have a fair chance at life.\n\nFang then somehow surprises me more by stepping onto the bed and kneeling next to Stella. At first, she glares at her with a fierce glower that makes me think she's about to punch the stego. Then her look softens, and then finally, she weakly smiles. She reaches out for Stella's hands, grabbing them in her own.\n\n\"I\u2026 I need to know,\" Fang starts in a soft, broken voice. \"Do you really love Anon? Does he mean everything to you?\" her eyes harden a bit as she pauses to catch an uneven breath. \"A-are\u2026 are you willing to do anything if it means\u2026 seeing him happy?\"\n\nStella looks Fang deep in her eyes. She then turns to look me in the eyes. Her cheeks grow rosy as she gives me the second most heartfelt smile, probably in her life.\n\nStella turns back to Fang, a smile still on her face. \"I do,\" she says in what was barely more than a whisper. She shuts her eyes again and snaps them open, her brow creasing and her gaze growing sharper. \"I do!\" She speaks with unwavering determination, all the while gripping Fang's hands tighter, almost as if they were a lifeline in a raging river.\n\nSilence falls upon the room again as Fang processes Stella's words. I can't bring myself to look at her anymore. I look down at my feet and even close my eyes, shutting the world out. All my guilt, all my fears culminate at this moment, laid bare for Fang to judge.\n\nI feel a hand on my shoulder. I wince before bringing my head up and opening my eyes. The hand on me is the monochromatic extension of Fang, who now looks at me with an expression that I can't pin as any one emotion. As I stare deep into her eyes, I feel a particular rage\u2014a righteous rage\u2014deep within her soul. Her grip on my shoulder tightens, and I can only surmise that she's preparing to deck me in the jaw or break my ribs. If that's the case, I won't resist\u2026\n\nShe raises her right hand, and before I can process it, she slaps me across the face. It's a well-deserved slap. It's still a sobering reminder that nothing in our lives happened without some kind of consequence.\n\nI shut my eyes and ready my body and soul for whatever other beating Fang would rightfully bring down upon me, only to be surprised when I hear her let out a sob. Before my mind can fully process the sound my ears pick up, I feel a familiar set of arms wrap around me, followed by a pair of feathery wings. I open my eyes, but all I can see are a few strands of silvery hair as she nuzzles her face against mine.\n\nFang hugs me tightly. It feels like no hug I have ever received from her. It feels like less of a hug and more of a last desperate embrace\u2026 like the type you'd give a loved one before they departed to live in some far-away country or the kind a child would give their soldier parent as they left off to fight in some war.\n\nI raised my hand to return the embrace, but I hesitated, my arms trembling with fear and shame...\n\n\"Anon\u2026\" Fang started, gingerly whispering into my ear. \"I\u2026 I forgive you\u2026 and I don't hate you\u2026\" She tightened her embrace and nuzzled my face more. \"I\u2026 I don't want to let you go. Every ounce of my being is telling me to hold on to you, to keep you with me forever... but that's\u2026 that's s-selfish\u2026 especially when there's someone who needs you more than I do\u2026\" She let out another sob, this one strained and mournful. \"Thank you for caring about me\u2026 till you did\u2026\"\n\nAt those words, I finally snap myself from my stupor and embrace Fang as tightly as I can. I know I don't deserve it. I know I have no right to, but if this is really to be our last interaction as lovers, I don't want to live my life with the regret that in the end, I was too much of a coward to embrace the person that I love. I can't muster a word to say to Fang. My insides only twist up in pain...\n\nFang breaks our embrace and looks me deep in the eyes again. Unlike before, where various negative emotions swirled within her, this time, there was only a peaceful yet melancholic serenity. Her gaze burrows through me, into my soul, for ten seconds before lunging forward and locking lips with me. Not counting our accidental kiss on the rooftop or us sharing an indirect kiss via a cigarette, this is our first\u2014and now last\u2014kiss.\n\nEven though I do not deserve it, I close my eyes and lose myself in the kiss. I can't help but wonder if, in some alternate universe, Fang\u2014Lucy, rather\u2014and I shared our lives.\n\nFang breaks the kiss and slowly lets me go. Her fingers are the last to part from my body, her whole body trembling as if the separation is excruciatingly painful.\n\nWhen Fang, at last, releases me, she turns back to face Stella. \"Anon\u2026 can be a big retard... but please take care of him.\" She then sets a narrowed on Stella. \"If you don't, so help me God I'll\u2026\" Fang raises a shaking first to the stego, her already sharp glare turning absolutely fiery.\n\nStella, frozen the same as me, can barely produce a nod.\n\nWith her point made abundantly clear and her farewells seemingly made, Fang takes not another moment to stand off the bed and leave without a further thought spared on our miserable company. She pauses for a second, almost as if sparing a thought, before opening the door as she takes one last glance back at me with teary eyes. She smiles weakly before opening the door and walking in the hallway, carefully closing the door behind her.\n\nNobody speaks a word for what feels like hours. Eventually, Rosa is the first to snap out of her shocked stupor. She looks between Stella and me and lets out a sigh.\n\n\"You two are the biggest pair of idiots I know\u2026\" She takes a deep breath, closes her eyes, and puts on the best smile she can, considering what she had been a witness to. \"Still, at least you're only idiots because of love\u2026\" she gives herself the sign of the cross and stands up. \u201cSi Fang encontro en su corazon perdonarlos a ustedes dos\u2026 then I\u2019ll do it too.\u201d She looks at Stella, her expression softening considerably. \"Stella\u2026 I'm sorry,\" she said as she walked up to her roommate and hugged her tight. \"I couldn't have known what you were really going through\u2026 \u00a1Y solo lo empeore!\"\n\nStella's eyes filled with tears for what felt like the millionth time that day as she returned her friend's embrace.\n\nI suddenly felt a presence approach me. I turned in time to see Reed standing before me. His expression was morose, almost like he was fighting the urge to say or do something that he knew he would later regret.\n\nDespite knowing that it was a stupid idea, I stood up from the bed and faced my raptor friend\u2014or would it be ex-friend now?\u2014and met his gaze with my own. We both stared at each other for a few seconds before Reed let out a tired sigh, closed his eyes, and began to laugh bitterly. His laughter turned more and more manic by the passing second until he put his hands on my shoulders and again snapped his eyes open, at which point I saw them shimmering with tears. He grits and glares like he wanted to do terrible things to me. As he does, I can feel his claws slowly digging into my shoulders before he stops completely and lets me go, dropping his arms and gazing at me with a face full of heartbreak. He doesn't say a word, but he doesn't need to. I know exactly what kind of pain he's feeling and what kind of emotional baggage he'll carry for months, if not years, to come.\n\nThe only thing I feel I can do is hug the poor raptor. Reed winces at first on feeling my body press against his, but soon enough, he hugs me back, almost as if accepting the small comfort I can give. He trembles for a second before finally speaking in a broken voice.\n\n\"B-bro\u2026 I\u2026 I fucked it up, didn't I?\"\n\nI pat him on the back carefully to not injure him any further. \"I fucked it up first. You just got caught in the middle of it.\"\n\n\"I\u2026 I thought that\u2026 that if I\u2026\" Reed doesn't finish his words. Instead, he takes a deep pained breath.\n\nI honestly don't know what else to tell him. It didn't matter what I said. He would still wind up feeling like garbage. He at least had noble intentions for all his lies and deceptions, unlike me.\n\nI finally break my embrace and smile at him, for whatever that's worth. He takes my expression in stride but remains somber and even slightly broken.\n\nAgain, I can't fault him for it.\n\nAt last, Reed returns to his original seat and cradles his chest again. By that point, Rosa's already finished hugging Stella and races up to Reed. She tells him to lift his arms, which he does with a pained expression. She lifts his shirt and inspects his abdomen, at which point I see huge bruises have started appearing all over his chest and stomach.\n\nShe turns to face us. \"I'm taking Reed to the hospital!\" she shouts, grabbing Reed by the shoulder and lifting him effortlessly. As she moves for the door, she looks back at Stella and me, almost as if she wants to say something. Ultimately, she shakes her head and smiles before opening the door and walking out in the hall, Reed in tow.\n\nStella and I stare at each other, unsure about what comes next. The only thing I could think of was sitting next to Stella and taking hold of her hands. She, in turn, tightens her grip and gives me a warm smile.\n\nI can't help but smile back at her.\n\nI hear the sound of a familiar voice clearing his voice. I turn to look at the door and see the crocodilian security officer from last night standing there. He stares at me with an annoyed expression, all the while holding his arms crossed. He glances around the trashed room and right towards Stella and me.\n\nWith a sigh, he points to me. \"It's seven in the morning, and Principal Spear's in his office. He wants to see you ASAP.\"\n\nI swallow a lump in my throat and look Stella in the eye. With a nod, I let go of her hands, and I stand up. With a deep breath to steel myself for the shitshow that was come, I walk towards the guard. I barely have taken two steps when Stella again grabs hold of my right hand. I turn to look at her, and she's standing next to me, with a determined look on her face.\n\n\"I'm coming too,\" she says to the guard before giving me a sideways glance. \"Where my boyfriend goes, I go.\"\n\nStella's words make my heart flutter a bit.\n\nThe guard sighs, rolls his eyes, and nods. \"Fine.\"\n\nThe guard steps back into the hall. Stella and I give each other another look, and we walk out into the hallway as well, hand in hand and ready to face what was to come.\n\nWhatever came next, we would face it together.\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nA whole week had passed since that fateful weekend when I sat down to watch anime with Stella. The shame and pain that followed remain deeply entrenched in my soul, but things have returned to more or less their usual rhythm.\n\nStella and I are still together. Dare I say, we are even absolutely ecstatic to be with each other. For Stella's part, being free to be herself around someone that fully appreciates her love for anime, astrology, and the occult has done wonders for her personality. Whereas before, she was a bit on the shy side when it came to school activities that weren't the gardening club, she now makes an effort to be active in just about anything, and all with an infectious smile. Her chipper attitude has also affected me, further helping me not be as much of a reclusive asshole. It made me start wanting to be social and help out in ways that surprise even me.\n\nMore importantly, it made me realize that the past I had been running from was pathetically petty. I even shared those pictures with Stella and Rosa, and they found them hilarious. To think that if I had just embraced this side of me back in Rock Bottom, I wouldn't have ever even needed to transfer out. But of course, I would have never learned that lesson back there. Of course, it took me a school change, new friends, and a complicated relationship to truly understand.\n\nStill, much as my life had improved, it was not all sunshine and rainbows.\n\nFor one thing, Reed hadn't yet been given the go-ahead to come back to school. It turns out that Rosa's self-defense routine broke twenty of the raptor's twenty-four ribs. He was in the hospital for five days, and he's not scheduled to return to school for at least another five. Feeling guilt over her overboard use of violence even if he did try to grapple her, Rosa has been visiting Reed every day of the last week, leaving Stella as standing president of the gardening club in the meantime. From what Rosa's told us, though, she's started developing quite the friendship with the pink raptor, finding his mannerism funny, as well as admitting to finding the idea of helping him beat his drug use a welcome challenge for her to tackle. Best of luck to her on that end. Reed and carfe go together like coffee and creamer.\n\nWhen he learned what I did and how I had broken Fang's heart, Naser gave me quite the beating. He only stopped when Fang got in between us and pleaded for him to stop. After she explained the situation and made him promise to leave me alone, Naser backed off, if very unhappily. It seems like whatever friendship I had between Fang's brother and myself was all but over. I can\u2019t blame him for hating me, though.\n\nTrish, as expected, went to town with the news of my cheating once she found out some of the details of what happened between Stella and me. She started spreading the rumor around that I had slept with Stella, which, to be fair, isn't false, but far as Fang, Reed, and Rosa were concerned, it was a wildly false accusation. Fang pretty quickly shut Trish up, and in her anger at her friend's betrayal, temporarily left VVURM DRAMA. The stupid trigger has been very quiet since, moping around in her way but generally keeping her trap shut lest she incurs further wrath from Fang.\n\nFinally, I received the dressing down of a lifetime from Principal Spears. I don't think I've ever heard anyone scream as loud as he had over my blatant violation of dorm visiting hours or how reckless what I did was. Thankfully, the security guard vouched for me, clarifying that my actions were taken out of a misguided attempt at preventing the loss of a life\u2026 even if my fears ultimately turned out completely false. Thanks to that guard, what would have been at least a day's suspension turned into more campus beautification via the gardening club. Of course, since Stella is standing president, this upcoming weekend wouldn't be as bad. At least, that was the hope.\n\nAs Stella and I sit on the campus rooftop enjoying our lunch and some anime on her phone, I can't help but feel slightly fortunate that things turned out as they had. Sure, people got hurt, and life wouldn't be the same anymore, but it all could have gone so much worse than it had\u2026\n\n\"Hey, Anon!\" Stella called to me, snapping me out of my thoughts.\n\n\"Yes?\" I answered with a smile.\n\n\"Are you done narrating everything that's happened to you since last week?\"\n\nI blink a couple of times and groan. 'Stupid mumbling,' I think to myself.\n\nStella giggles and gives me a peck on the cheek. \"It's okay. I like your mumbling. It reminds me of a lot of a show where the MC thinks to himself out loud in an echo-y voice.\"\n\nI let out a laugh at that. \"I know they do that for the benefit of the audience, but have you ever wondered the logistics of it? Does it happen in real-time, or is it like slowed-time? What about if another character can read minds? Is it acknowledged, or do they just roll with it like it's normal?\"\n\nStella gives me a shrug and cuddles up to me a bit more. \"Whatever the case is, I like it. Never stop doing it, Anon.\"\n\nI hug Stella tighter, thankful to have someone in my life that doesn't view my mumbling habit as something in need of correction but rather to be celebrated.\n\n\"So,\" I ask, looking my weeb stego girlfriend in the eye, \"What are we watching today?\"\n\n\"Glad you asked!\" Stella chirps as she does various taps on her phone. \"Today, we're watching Runaway Space Ideon!\"\n\nI only know of the show, thanks to it being one of the earlier works of Yoshiyuki Tomino, aka \"Kill 'em All\" Tomino.\n\nStella lets out another giggle. \"That's right, Anon, and he would later go on to make the Gundam Series!\" she gave me another kiss on the cheeks and beamed. \"See, you're not the only one who can address a non-existent crowd of people!\"\n\nI roll my eyes and tap her phone. \"Let's stop poking fun at my disability and start watching!\"\n\n\"Hey!\" Stella suddenly exclaims, giving me a furrowed look. \"I, for one, find your 'disability' extremely charming and worth protecting!\"\n\nI again roll my eyes, but I can't help but have a huge grin on my lips as I do.\n\nThe door to the rooftop suddenly opens, surprising Stella and me. For a second, I dread to think that it's Naser and Naomi once again coming up to have their brand of fun. I let out a sigh of relief when I realize that it's only Fang who's visiting us.\n\nWait. Fang's visiting us?\n\nWe pause the video as Stella and I look at each other, confirming that no, we were not having separate hallucinations about Fang standing in front of us and that yes, the real flesh and blood Fang was there.\n\n\"Hey, dweebs,\" Fang says in a cheerful, albeit slightly forced tone before either Stella or myself can say anything. \"H-how are you,\" she then says in a more reserved manner, one closer to how she likely feels in that moment.\n\nStella and I look at each other again before Stella looks Fang in the eyes and smiles widely. \"We're doing great, actually!\" she exclaims in a bubbly way that just makes me want to hug her tighter.\n\nFang gives Stella a nod and a smile before glancing my way. It's quick, but I can once again see the pain in her eyes as she grabs onto her arm and fidgets a bit.\n\n\"I\u2026 I just came by to see how you guys were doing, but it seems like everything's cool, so I worried for nothing!\" she lets out a single laugh and turns around. \"A-anyway, I'll let you two get back to your anime watching. I'll\u2026 I'll see you both later\u2026\"\n\n\"Wait,\" I start, calling out to Fang just as she's about to open the door. I look at Stella, who gives me a smiling nod. She seems to know my plan before I can even tell her anything.\n\n\"Do you\u2026 want to hang out for the rest of lunch?\" I ask, not knowing what kind of answer I would get from Fang.\n\nFang's eyes widen for a split second before she clears her throat and fidgets a bit more.\n\n\"I mean\u2026 I don't know\u2026 I do have a lot of things to do, a-and places to be and other stuff\u2026\" She takes a deep breath and gives us a wide smile. \"But, seeing as you two dweebs are so alone up here, I'll stick around for a while.\"\n\n\"We'd love to have you join us!\" Stella joyously exclaims.\n\nI give Fang a nod, though I'm not ready yet to say anything else to her. So much had happened, and so much of that pain was still fresh. Yet, ignoring it or letting it fester wasn't healthy for any of us. Regardless of what we were at the end of the day or who we chose to give our hearts to, we were still friends, our tribulations helping to forge us into stronger people. After all, loving someone meant far more than just a physical relationship.\n\nFang takes another deep breath and walks towards us, a bitter-sweet smile on her lips.\n\nYes. Fang may not have been my goth ptero girlfriend anymore, but that didn't stop her from being my friend any less, and friends support each other through thick and thin..."},"Estrus Season Hits Hard.txt":{"path":["Stella","Estrus Season Hits Hard.txt"],"text":"Title: Estrus Season Hits Hard\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Stella, Rosa and Anon\nRating: Semi-NSFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\nSummary: Estrus season hits Stella while the semester ends - aka after prom. She then finds out hentai logic doesn't apply to real life.\n\n\nCome on Stella, you can do it! You're a big girl now.\n\nEighteen, that's practically an adult, right?\n\nYou'll be like the grownups and handle estrus season without any embarrassing incidents this time!\n\nThese are the thoughts I muse myself with as I struggle to keep hold of my pen. My hand is very, very eager to explore a certain aching spot between my legs.\n\nI take a deep breath to steel myself, fighting the carnal urges.\n\nThe plan is simple. Write a list of everyone I should avoid, and them avoid them. Only for a few weeks.\n\nShould be easy-peasy, though the burning feeling within my body warns otherwise.\n\nOh gosh, this is the absolute worst!\n\nI want to scream and shout, anything to make the heat go away.\n\nUgh, concentrate! Just write the list, baka! Then you can take a nice, long shower. Yeah, just set the head to pulsate and...\n\nI forcibly set my attention back to the task at hand.\n\nHokai. Let's do this!\n\nWithout heeding much notice to the shame of having talked to so few guys that I can probably name them all, I start racking my brain on the matter.\n\nOkay. Prom. Chadshark.\n\nHe wasn't that bad to hang with, so that's a no-no.\n\nWho's next?\n\nReed.\n\nUgh, Reed? Seriously?\n\n...\n\nYeah okay, I can see that happen. He's kinda muscular, plus that tank top is hot.\n\nUhhhh...\n\nOh right, those two guys from the club!\n\nThen uhhh...\n\nI shuffle around in my seat, unable to find a comfortable position.\n\nDamn, I'm so fucking wet already, this is a nightmare. I know that the first few days are the worst of it, but that doesn't really help my situation any. Damn dino genes.\n\nOh, that reminds me! Anon!\n\n...even though he's a skinnie? Plus he's got Fang.\n\nI find myself biting my lip. Intersex isn't unheard of. He's cute too, when he's not being an asshole for no reason.\n\nMhmm, I'd totally blow him even if he's an asshole.\n\n...\n\nWoah, where did that come from? Come on girl, you can't just... Like...\n\nHowever much my mind shouts no, I can't stop nibbling on the pen. Fuck, I fucking want Anon to dominate me now!\n\nOoooohhhh...!!!\n\nI can't stop my imagination.\n\n...\n\n[Asshole Anon]\n\"On your knees bitch. And open wide.\"\n\nI obey, of course, awaiting my due punishment.\n\nHe's so strong and manly!\n\nCome on Anon, give me that big meaty HUMAN COCK!\n\n[Asshole Anon]\n\"ITADAKIMASU STERRA CHAN\"\n\n[Asshole Anon]\n\"Also, your waifu a shit.\"\n\n...\n\nChuckling, I get back to the present.\n\nWhere was I?\n\nUgh, the list. Great, now it has drool on it.\n\n...\n\nWell, five names is plenty. Time for that shower.\n\n* * *\n\nOne shameful shower and restless night later, it's time for school. I've even put my usual stream watching session aside in an attempt to cool my head. Although looking back now, I probably could have used the distraction.\n\nWhatevs, I'm just being a silly-cat like always.\n\nI put on my most plain clothes in hopes of avoiding the guys' attention. Not that I get much anyway.\n\nA baggy shirt and cargo shorts. Would've preferred something that covers my legs, but all I have are sticky jeans. Defo don't want boys to check out my cute butt!\n\nAfter that I make my way to the kitchen, gulping down my bowl of colorful cereal that Daddy has prepared for me. He's probably already off to work, same as Mommy.\n\nThat saddens me a bit, but at least now I have some time to figure out a plan for today. There should be a special estrus education thingy spanning the first few periods. They do one each semester.\n\nIf I don't see Rosa there I'll just find her later. She's super strict about boys, so I know she'll keep me in check too.\n\nI mean, not like she'll have to. Just uhh, on the off-chance, right?\n\nGosh, how does she even do that? Despite my most sincere efforts, I still couldn't push the thought of sucking off Anon out of my head.\n\nIn my desperation, I flick on the TV and search for some morning cartoons. If I'm lucky, I can catch the DBZ rerun.\n\n...\n\nSeems I'm not lucky.\n\nI look around the room, frustrated. There must be something to get my mind off of boys.\n\nI entertain the idea of a speedy tarot reading, but quickly dismiss it. I know myself too well to know that right now I'm predisposed to looking for arcana related to sex. Even if Gaia herself talked through my hand, I'd fail to give real meaning to even a half-spread.\n\nMmmmmaybe another shower? That should help get the edge off.\n\nI feel a little ashamed, knowing that it isn't the getting clean part that motivates me. Still, what could it hurt?\n\n* * *\n\nI arrive a few minutes before the start, having enjoyed the shower a little too much. \n\nBut! I did come twice, and only thought of Anon a little.\n\nOkay, a lot. Gosh, I don't even know where these thoughts are coming from! I'm sure that I don't like him that much!\n\nUgh...\n\nThankfully, Rosa saved a seat for me at the end of the first row.\n\n[Rosa]\n\"Hey, Stella! You're running a bit late. Is everything okay?\"\n\nLooking at Rosa alone, one definitely could not tell that estrus season has begun. She looks like she always does.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Yeah, sorry.\"\n\nI take my place next to her and we make some smalltalk.\n\nShe also informs me that there's going to be an impromptu club meeting this afternoon, which is weird cause we rarely have those, and never on a Monday.\n\nPlus only the two of us can call for a meeting, so Rosa definitely has something planned. Double weird that she's not told me.\n\nBefore I could ask, the head nurse appears at the teacher's desk. She's another stego like me, so I've always found her relatable. I've only met her a couple of times, but she's always been nice to me.\n\nToday in place of her usual nurse robes she's donned a more professional looking attire, some variation of a business suit. It definitely compliments her curvy body and raven-like facial features.\n\nI guess she deals with estrus in a different manner than I intend to.\n\nIn examination, I notice that her shirt isn't buttoned up all the way. In fact if I look behind the long tie, I can practically see the top brim of her lacey bra.\n\nOh gosh, should I tell her? Um... This is so awkward.\n\nShe plugs her laptop into the projector that's already been set up, and greets us in an overly cheerful manner.\n\n[Nurse]\n\"Hello there, girls! This heat, huh?\"\n\nShe does a very animated fanning motion, causing a few girls to giggle.\n\nI'm lost focusing on her jiggly breasts. Is this what boys do too?\n\nThe slideshow eventually starts, and I can finally distract myself.\n\n[Nurse]\n\"You probably all know why we're here today. The estrous cycle. Rut. Heat. Breeze. Whatever you wanna call it.\"\n\n[Nurse]\n\"We'll cover the topic in a series of small talks. What's happening, WHY is it happening, why you should be careful, and finally how to be careful.\"\n\n[Nurse]\n\"Aww shucks, I was a teen once too you know, so I won't be all like, NO BOYS!\"\n\nShe gives the audience a wink with a sly grin.\n\n[Nurse]\n\"But don't you tell Spears about that, okay?\"\n\nShe's rewarded with a few laughs and nods. While her smile remains, she continues in a more serious tone.\n\n[Nurse]\n\"I'm sure that you've all heard most of what I'm about to tell you, but it is still my responsibility to make sure you can make educated choices and don't give in to rumors and misconceptions.\"\n\n[Nurse]\n\"Alright, before I bore you all to death, here's the real important part. If you think you're making the right choice and... Love a boy... Be smart about it!\"\n\nShe produces a small box from inside her jacket, and hands it to the girl on the opposite end of the first row. Poor girl's face goes up in flames as the box is revealed to be a pack of condoms.\n\nWow.\n\n[Nurse]\n\"Take a look, then pass it forward. It's my favorite brand.\"\n\nThe nurse continues unabated, that coy smile returning to her lips.\n\n[Nurse]\n\"But that's a secret too, okay?\"\n\nAgain, wow. That's definitely not how I got to know her. She's always used to be so mild mannered! In the past years, she's just skipped through the slideshow, giving us the rest of the day off. What happened?\n\nI look back at the girl she gave the box to, and note that she's already passed it to the student sitting behind her.\n\nI can't deny that it's perplexing. I'm actually excited, awaiting the pack to get to me.\n\nNext to me, Rosa mumbles something under her breath, and I can see her clutching onto her crucifix.\n\nRight, maybe not everyone is as excited as I am.\n\nI divert my attention back to the presentation.\n\nWe go through the usual biology textbook snippets detailing estrus, ovulation, gestation, and so on.\n\nThen we get onto hormones and pheromones, and finally onto prevention and protection.\n\nAround that time the pack gets to me from the girl behind me. I would have taken a look at it when Rosa got it, be she passed it on without even a glance. Some resolve she has.\n\nIt's an 8-pack of barbed Magnum Dongs. I don't really get what the barbs are for, but the pack claims that it's for \"her pleasure\". That causes my face to go bright red, and I decide to pass the thing on.\n\nExcept I'm the last in line. I don't want to return it in the middle of the presentation either, so I decide to hold onto it till the end.\n\nSaid end comes not long after. There is one new slide that I don't remember from previous years, a chart of some sort.\n\nThere are a few kinds of dinos at the top, then humans, and then a various list of animals. It has no metric, just a slider going from green to red.\n\n[Nurse]\n\"Okay, I've given you the important bit at the start so now that we're wrapping it up, have some more wisdom!\"\n\nShe chuckles at her own pun.\n\n[Nurse]\n\"Like I said, I won't tell you not to find a partner. The point of this whole presentation was so you can choose the right one. So, for your consideration!\"\n\n[Nurse]\n\"Male dinos depending on the kind go about it for five to ten minutes. Humans, also depending, can be around the same, but average a good half hour to an hour. Pigs? Several hours. Ducks? Not even if you die.\"\n\nWith that, she shuts the projector off and thanks us for the attention.\n\nSeveral students immediately make a beeline for the exit, the rest get up slowly and stretch. It has been a few hours afterall.\n\nI've never really considered that different species have sex differently. I mean, for such varying amounts of time.\n\nAnd humans...? Huh.\n\nImmediately my mind wanders to Anon and my fantasies.\n\nI look down at the pack of condoms in my hand.\n\nSo... If it's not a bad thing to find a mate... If I only need to be smart about it...\n\nBut...\n\nIn any case, I still have to give this stupid thing back to the nurse before she leaves.\n\nThere are a few girls waiting to talk to her, so I get in line, motioning for Rosa that she can leave if she wants.\n\nShe still seems mad about the whole ordeal. Maybe she's not okay with the whole sex-ed in school thing? I've never really noticed it in the past.\n\nMinutes pass and the line eventually dwindles down to just me.\n\n[Nurse]\n\"And what can I help you with, little Stella?\"\n\nI blush at the nickname. It's what she usually calls me.\n\n[Stella]\n\"Just giving this back.\"\n\nI try handing her the box, but in response she just giggles, amused.\n\n[Nurse]\n\"Oh, you can keep that. I don't think a smart girl like you will do anything stupid, but it's better to have it, right?\"\n\nI don't know what to say to that. My awkward expression probably says it all.\n\n[Nurse]\n\"Say hi to Rosa for me, okay? Have a nice day!\"\n\nShe leaves abruptly, but with a wink. Just before the door closes I catch a glimpse of some human guy in a suit, waiting for the nurse.\n\nSo that's why she was dressed like that. The implications, cause me to blush hard once again.\n\nAs the room quiets down it dawns on me that I'm in the middle of the school, brandishing a pack of condoms in my hand.\n\nOH GOSH\n\nI hastily sink the damn thing into one of my pockets, and rush outside.\n\nI'm barely through the doorframe as I bump into none other than the bane of my existence lately, Anon.\n","Title":"Estrus Season Hits Hard","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Stella, Rosa and Anon","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Anonymous","Summary":"Estrus season hits Stella while the semester ends - aka after prom.

I know this is the right place, but honestly I'm just looking for any excuse to procrastinate. I expected Stella's house to be pretty ordinary, but I didn't expect it to be the textbook definition of \"typical\". The directions she gave me pointed to the dead center of one of those mass produced housing complexes. The kind where every house is identical and the only trees are newly planted saplings evenly spaced in every yard.\n\nStella's house only stands out by how excessively generic it is. All the other owners tried to put at least some unique personal touch on their houses, but not Stella's.  The front lawn is cut to AstroTurf perfection with nothing on it, there's a tiny little garden sparsely filled with maintenance-free bushes by the porch, and right next to the front door is a big wooden sign that reads \"Live. Laugh. Love.\"\n\nFuck that, nobody tells me how to live my life. I'll die, cry, and hate just to spite that stupid piece of lumber\n\nSomehow, this aggressively bland house feels like a foreboding monolith tonight. I shouldn't be this intimidated, but the whole idea of coming here reminds me too much of the disaster that's been hounding me all year. Unlike the rest of Volcano High, Stella only seemed more interested in me after the auditorium fiasco. It's not hard to guess why. Stella could barely keep her power level hidden at the best of times, and finding someone else who could share in her interests is probably a cherished rarity\n\nThe worst part is, I know exactly where she's coming from. A couple years ago, if I was in her position, I probably would have reacted the same way. That's why the invitation to her \"movie night\" makes my skin crawl so much. This whole evening might be an endless parade of cringe inducing memories and second-hand embarrassment. I only accepted the invitation because of Stella's inexhaustible persistence. No amount of deft verbal maneuvering or expertly crafted excuses could hold her back forever. It didn't help that Fang had quite literally pushed me out the door, insisting I get out and actually do something for once this summer.\n\nAt least Rosa is supposed to be here too, surely Stella will have the good sense to restrain herself. Hopefully this night won't end with an angry Ankylosaur dragging both of us down to the nearest chapel. Maybe Rosa even brought food! That soup she makes almost made working in the gardens worth it, but not quite.\n\nSteeling myself, I march up to the front door and ring the doorbell, the timeless two-tone chime audible on the other side of the white pastel door. As I stand here waiting, the urge to overturn that stupid wooden sign is overwhelming. It's smug suburban-trash aura mocks me, compelling me to retaliate in defiance of it's spineless, feel-good platitudes. I reach over, turn the sign upside down, and put it back. Truly, I am the epitome of the unchained rebellious spirit. The heavy sound of footsteps running down a staircase draws my attention away from urban vandalism and back to the door. Stella positively bounces down the hall and up to the door, pulling it open with a wide smile on her face.\n\n\"Anon! You really made it!\" She beams. Damn, she really is looking forward to this. I almost feel like an asshole for intentionally avoiding this for so long.\n\n\"Yeah, I made it.\" I reply, sheepishly rubbing the back of my head. There's no turning back, now I really have to see this through.\n\n\"Well, come on in!\" Stella beams, eagerly hopping from foot to foot. It's honestly pretty adorable. She's even got her tail twisted up around her leg like she does when she's really happy. I wonder if she developed that habit so it wouldn't smack into walls when she's excited, those spikes have to be capable of some damage.\n\nFollowing Stella inside, it seems the interior of her home is just as generic as the exterior. If it weren't for the occasional small sign of habitation, I would have sworn the place was up for sale, or some cable sitcom set. Whoever the interior decorator is has an obsession with soft pastels, from the furniture all the way up to the ceiling. Each painting on the wall looks like it was sold along with the frame, all either a poor watercolor flower or an 'artistic' monochrome photos.\n\nAs Stella leads me into a kitchen that seems somehow both overly spacious and uncomfortably cramped, I at last spot something that shows a real family actually lives here. Pinned to the giant stainless steel fridge is a photo, showing a smiling family of four stegosaurus in matching sports team apparel. Stella is easy to recognize, so the other three must be her family. The woman who must be Stella's mother has a haircut that absolutely screams 'Karen', and her father is balding with a big beer belly to match. The only one I can't figure out is the young male stegosaurus next to the father.\n\n\"Oh yeah, that's my family.\" Stella explains, clearly noticing where my attention drifted, \"That's my Mom and Dad, obviously. The big guy on the left next to my Dad is my older brother, Steve.\"\n\n'Big Guy' is right, that stego is built like a linebacker, which judging by the jersey he's wearing might be a very apt description. Steve looks like he could crush me like a soda can with those arms.\n\n\"Is he here?\" I ask, suddenly a little apprehensive. If this guy falls into the overprotective brother clich\u00e9, he might not appreciate another dude spending time with his sister.\n\n\"Oh, no.\" Stella's face falls a little, \"He's still on campus. My parents are helping him pack up his dorm for the summer this weekend.\"\n\nWhich means Stella invited me over when her parents weren't home. Well, at least Rosa will be here, so it won't be just the two of us.\n\n\"That reminds me, Rosa had to cancel at the last minute, so it will be just the two of us!\"\n\nOh god damn it, of course. I was already worried going into this, and now I have to navigate this potential minefield on my own. Without Rosa's puritan presence to restrain her, who knows what Stella will pull out to watch tonight. Not to mention I am now alone with a single girl whose parent's won't be home for days. Shit, when Fang finds out about this she's going to flip. I've already become very familiar with Fang's jealous side, and that was after incidents far more innocuous than this. Still, this whole debacle is partially her fault anyway, so she can't get mad at me. Right?\n\n\"Anon? You're mumbling again.\" \n\nShit, I must have zoned out again. Stella looks worried, her previous exuberance replaced by a timid nervousness. Her tail had uncoiled itself from around her leg, and now she's shyly fidgeting with those horizontal spikes on the end. It must have been easy to read my expression earlier, and now I've gone and crushed her excitement like a total jerk.\n\n\"Sorry Stella, got lost in my head for a second\" I apologize, looking for a way to quickly change the topic, \"Hey, do we have any snacks or something?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah!\" Stella perks up, grabbing some thick mitts from the counter and opening the oven, \"Rosa taught me how to make some really good dip, so I thought we'd have nachos.\"\n\nHot damn, that actually smells amazing. The ceramic pot Stella pulls out isn't filled with some weak melted cheese sauce, but instead a thickly loaded menagerie of beans, tomatoes, peppers, and I don't even know what else. Even from a distance, I can tell it's absolutely delicious. \n\n\"C'mon then,\" Stella laughs, noticing my ravenous expression,  \"I've already got the chips up in my room.\" Stella leads me further into the house and up a flight of stairs to the second level. It's a little awkward following her through the hallway with that massive tail swaying happily behind her. We also passed by at least another four wall decorations plastered with those three insufferable words, 'Live Laugh Love'. I wonder if Stella's mother bought them all at the same store, or even in bulk. At the end of the upstairs hallway is clearly Stella's room, judging by the hand decorated sign on the wall with her name on it.\n\nStella's room is a far cry from the washed out banality of the rest of the house. She must have a sweet spot for soft things, the carpet is unbelievably fluffy and the bed is nearly covered in bright pink, faux fur pillows. There's even a couple stuffed animals lovingly arranged around the alarm clock on the nightstand.\n\nNext to the window is a small telescope pointed up at the nighttime sky, and a large wooden desk. The surface is strewn with star-charts, horoscope sheets, and what looks like letters from a university. That familiar tarot deck is stacked on the corner, the card edges frayed and worn.\n\nWhile Stella is fiddling with a laptop connected to a little flat-screen TV in the corner, I take the opportunity to peruse her bookshelf. There's two whole shelves dedicated to manga, and sadly it's exactly the type of stuff I expected. 'My Hero Academia', 'Rock Art Online', 'Demon Slayer', the works. Nothing outrageously bad, but nothing really unique either. I wonder if there's some way I can covertly introduce her to something that isn't just Shonen Jump trash. A couple of familiar looking cases catch my eye, and I crouch down to look at the bottom row. Ah yes, Rockstation games. Hopefully Stella's taste in video games is a little less depressing than her taste in anime. There's Madden 2017, 2018, and 2019, those must belong to her brother. There's the entire up Persona series up to date, which explains the tarot cards. There's Final Fantasy, Devil May Cry, and of course Kingdom Hearts.\n\n\"Oh Anon! Have you played any of those before?\" Stella asks, looking over her shoulder, \"I can lend you a couple if you want.\"\n\n\"No thanks, I'm more of an Xrox kind of guy.\" I explain, standing up, \"First person shooters and stuff, you know?\"\n\n\"That makes sense\" Stella laughs, dragging a couple bean-bag chairs over to the T.V., \"I should have guessed.\"\n\nBefore I can take my seat, the sight on the T.V. stops me cold. Oh god, she's just loaded up Crunchyrock on there. Worse, she's scrolling through the dubbed section. I need to do something now before I'm subjected to an entire evening of terrible voice acting and bad translations. Something catches my eye on the bookshelf, and I immediately jump at the sudden idea.\n\n\"Hey Stella, are those all the studio Ghibli films?\" I ask, pointing at the navy blue box. \n\n\"Oh yeah! I picked those up at a convention last year. I even got the set signed!\" Stella beams proudly, \"Which one is your favorite? I just love 'Kiki's Delivery Service'.\"\n\n\"Actually, I haven't seen any of them.\" I lie, hoping Stella reacts the way I predicted, \"I've heard good things, but I've been meaning to watch one of them for a while now.\" Sure enough, Stella jumps straight up and turns on me with a comically shocked expression.\n\n\"Anon! How could you not have seen any of them?\" Stella gasps, rushing over to the bookcase behind me. I barely have time to move out of the way before she grabs the case and starting flipping through the discs\n\n\"Well, I know what we're doing tonight! Let's see, which one would you like... \" Stella mumbles, tail thumping against the floor, \"Probably something with a little action... definitely not that one... Oh, how about 'Princess Mononoke'? It's a classic among classics!\"\n\n\"Yeah, that sounds good.\" I agree. There's nothing wrong with rewatching a good movie, especially one I haven't seen in a long time. I drop down into one of the fuzzy beanbag chairs while Stella slides the DVD into her laptop. I feel little bad about the deception, but who could blame me for a bit of self preservation?\n\nI help myself to the bowl of chips and some of that thick dip as Stella takes her seat on the other bag. I make a mental note to ask Rosa for the recipe later, this stuff is good enough to be an entire meal. Stella grabs a couple bites too as the movie begins, pulling up her knees and wrapping her tail around her legs. I settle in as well, leaning back and watching the familiar scenes unfold.\n\nThe movie is just as good as I remember, it's a classic for a reason after all. As the hours begin to tick by, I can't help but notice Stella seems a little distracted. She keeps glancing over at me, and while occasionally she asks how I'm enjoying the movie, most of the time she says nothing. Occasionally she fidgets with her hands, opening her mouth as if to say something, then stops. A couple times during the movie, Stella tries to subtly nudge her beanbag chair closer to mine, and a sweet smell works it way over to my nose. Is Stella wearing perfume? I can't escape this strange uncomfortable feeling that's been brewing all night. Something in the back of my mind just won't le me relax completely.\n\n\"Well? What did you think?\" Stella asks, standing up and stretching her arms over her head as the credits begin to roll.\n\n\"It was good.\" I answer honestly, cracking my back. \"I can see why people like it.\"\n\n\"Yeah...\" Stella trails off uncertainly, walking over to the desk and tracing her fingers over the tarot deck. \"Hey Anon, um... would you like another tarot reading?\"\n\n\"Didn't I just have one a while ago?\" I ask, a little confused. Stella usually only offers those readings when something important is going on. She doesn't usually just pull out her deck on an impulse.\n\n\"That was just a quick one card reading.\" Stella explains, nervously wringing her hands, \"I want to do a full reading for you. It's um...more detailed and accurate... I think you'll find it really interesting.\"\n\nMy first reaction would be to decline the offer, but I can tell things would get pretty awkward fast if I did. Normally I wouldn't buy into this hockey new-age mumbo-jumbo, but somehow Stella's predictions have been uncannily accurate in the past. Maybe that's just a trick of hindsight, but I can't just dismiss them completely. There's no harm in giving her a chance.\n\n\"Sure, I guess.\" I concede. I expected Stella to be excited, but now she just looks even more timid. She climbs up onto her bed and sits cross-legged, patting a spot on the mattress across from her for me to sit.\n\nThat uncomfortable feeling in the back my head is back with a vengeance, but I'm too committed at this point to just jump ship. I awkwardly take a seat across from her, the small mattress forcing us a little closer than I would prefer. Stella has to know this is starting to get weird, right?\n\n\"Okay, so this reading is more in depth and uses three cards.\" Stella explains, growing a little more confident as she slips into what must be a familiar topic, \"The first one reveals your past, the next one is your present, and the third one is your future. Taken together they form your fortune, get it?\"\n\nI nod as Stella draws the first card. Flipping it down onto the bedsheet, she reveals a picture of a blindfolded raptor carrying a rucksack, seemingly unaware he's about to walk off a cliff. It's one of the few cards I actually recognize.\n\n\"The Fool symbolizes new journeys and adventure.\" Stella begins, \"As your past card, this means you've recently started a new chapter in your life, something transformative that will likely change who you are and the path you take in life.\"\nWell... Stella is probably one-for-three so far with this. My life really has changed dramatically since arriving at Volcano High. Between making some real friends, getting my life on-track for once, and most importantly meeting Fang, I can't deny the past six months have been transformative.\n\n\"However, the fool is upright.\" Stella continues, \"That means your journey may not yet be over. There could still be more you need to see and learn before it's complete. The other two cards might give us more clues...\"\nStella flips over the next card, revealing a tall stone tower wreathed in flame. A parasaur is leaping from the window, and a large gold crown is falling from the tower's summit.\n\n\"Um... so the Tower symbolizes upheaval, specifically in structures and relationships you rely on.\" Stella explains, stammering a bit. I'm not sure if the card unnerved her, or if something else is. \"As your present card, that means you are facing significant change in your life, or will very soon. That change will eventually lead you to a better place, and strengthen you as a person.\"\n\nOkay, a little more ominous, but I don't really buy into this prediction stuff to begin with. Who isn't facing change in their life sooner or later? Anyone could have drawn that card and probably thought of some way it fits their life.\n\n\"And finally, for your future...um...\" Stella trails off, reluctantly revealing the final card, \"The Lovers...\"\n\nI look down at the final card, a pair of beautiful pteranodon locking in a loving embrace beneath the sun. That part of the fortune seems pretty obvious to me, but before I can ask Stella to explain she begins.\n\n\"So, as your future, that means you're going to start a very, um... special relationship soon.\" Stella stammers, her hand trembling, \"Taken together with the Fool and Tower, I would say that... maybe things are about to change in your life? That... something central to your life might change.\"\n\nMy back stiffens as Stella suddenly traces her fingers over my hand. Her grip is reluctant, almost afraid, and suddenly everything wrong about tonight snaps together in my head. Stella's parents aren't home, Rosa didn't make it, and now this tarot reading...\n\n\"Anon...\" Stella whispers, and I only now realize she's been slowly leaning toward me this entire time, \"Have you um... ever thought about-\"\n\n\"Stella.\" I firmly interrupt her, pulling my hand away. I know what I'm about to ask might ruin our friendship, but I have to say it. This is something I refuse to trivialize. \"Are you trying to get me to cheat on Fang?\"\n\nStella slaps her hands over her snout, her eyes widening in shock. Emotions flash over her face; surprise, fear, guilt, then sadness. She hides her face in her palms, leaning over and letting out a slow whine of despair.\n\n\"Stella.\" I ask again, her reaction all the proof I needed that I was right, \"Did you invite me over hoping something would happen?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry Anon!\" Stella cries, curling tightly into herself, \"I'm so sorry! I knew this was a bad idea! I knew it! I know you and Fang are happy together and she really deserves to be but- I just-\" Stella totally breaks down, crying and sniffling into her hands, unable to look up at me. I should feel betrayed, angry that somebody I considered a friend would pull a stunt like this, but it's clear Stella just didn't have her heart in this whole scheme. Watching her now just fills me with pity and empathy. Watching Stella cry is like looking at a sad puppy.\n\n\"Stella, hey... c'mon.\" I lay a comforting hand on her shoulder, taking it as a good sign when she doesn't flinch away, \"I'm not mad, and I don't hate you. Just tell me why you would do something like this.\" Stella sniffs hard, shuddering as she tries to collect herself. When she finally does speak, her voice is quiet and hoarse.\n\n\"It's just...\" She begins, wiping her red eyes but keeping her gaze on the mattress, \"School is finally over, and we're all going off to college soon. We're probably not going to see each other again for a long time...\"\n\n\"And, well... I never had a boyfriend in school. I always figured I would find somebody later, but now senior year is over and-\" Stella chokes up, her voice moving faster to get the words out before the tears escape, \"Now I'm worried I never will and everyone in college will already know what they're doing and I'm just so weird-\" She breaks down sobbing again, pulling her legs up to her chest and hiding behind her knees. Her long plated tail curls protectively around her, as if she's trying to tightly hug herself.\n \nIt's not hard to feel for her. The fear of being alone, of missing out on opportunities that can never come back, it's something I'm very familiar with. They were fears I had deluded myself about a long time ago. Those fears were only truly put away for good after I had fallen in love with Fang. If I had gotten what I wanted six months ago and graduated without making the memories I had, I would probably be in Stella's position, forced to finally face the inescapable reality of time head-on.\n\n\"Stella, it's not that bad.\" I console her, handing her a fluffy down pillow to cry into, \"You're a sweet, passionate girl. You'll find somebody soon enough. Trust me, there's plenty of guys who would like you.\"\n\nCome the fuck on Anon, is that really the best I can come up with right now? That had to be the most generic, clich\u00e9 consolation ever delivered. Stella deserves better than that, but it's the only thing that came to mind. I never thought I would be on the delivery end of this type of conversation.\n\n\"It's not just that...\" Stella mumbles, gripping the pillow tight against her chest, \"You see, I... I thought that this was my last chance to tell you I sort of... like you...\"\n\n\"Really?\" I ask, not at all that surprised. Honestly, I was already starting to suspect that might be part of the reason behind all this. \"Since when?\" \n\n\"Since you were at gardening club...\" Stella admits, hiccupping softly. Even with the pillow hiding her face, I can tell how hard she's blushing. \"It only got really bad after the concert at Moe's.\"\n\nNo wonder I missed it, I had a lot on my mind back then. Even so, at the time I would have laughed at the idea of anyone being interested in me. I couldn't help but wonder if I didn't love Fang, would I be willing to be with Stella? Honestly, I don't know. I just can't see myself having the same sort of bond with anyone else as I do with Fang. That's really not the thing I should tell Stella right now though, I need to let her down gently.\n\n\"Stella,\" I begin, making sure to chose my words very carefully, \"Would you still like me if I was the type of person who would cheat on Fang?\" Stella stays silent for a while, slowly calming down and getting her breathing under control.\n\n\"No...\" Stella sadly admits, wiping her face, \"No, I wouldn't. This whole idea was stupid... rigging the tarot deck, not inviting Rosa... I'm so sorry Anon, please don't hate me...\"\n\n\"I don't hate you Stella, I forgive you.\" I pat her head reassuringly, climbing off the bed and working my cramped legs. \"Listen, it's still pretty early. Why don't you invite Rosa over? You two can talk about stuff together. She'll help you feel better.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's probably a good idea.\" Stella sniffs, raising her head to finally look at me again, \"Are you really sure you're not mad?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm sure.\" I smile, sincerely, \"I still had fun tonight you know. I wouldn't mind doing another movie night later on if you want.\"\n\n\"Uuugh, Anon!\" Stella half groans, burying her face back into the pillow. I just barely catch the glimpse of a weak smile on her snout. \"Why do you have to be so nice about this? I can't stand it, get out of here already!\"\n\nI chuckle, waving goodbye to Stella as she weakly waves back. I find my own way out of the house, heading back into the warm humid night. I let out a long sigh on the sidewalk, the tension finally dropping out of my shoulders. That certainly wasn't what I expected to happen tonight, but honestly it's all probably for the best.

What would\u2019ve been a fun celebration of everyone moving up and into the real world was completely marred by what had happened.\nBy what I had caused.\nI hadn\u2019t dared show my face around Volcano High on the actual day of graduation. The guilt had kept me in bed throughout the day and the weeks beforehand, long after the physical injuries had healed. Even the thought of them looking at me after what had happened created an almost agonizing turn in my stomach. I went in a couple of days after graduation proper. Principal Spears unceremoniously handed me my diploma, the ultimate culmination of my failure. What little pleasantries he had to offer was done more quietly than I had ever heard him speak.\nAs I left his office for the final time, a thought crossed my mind - \u2018Does he know?\u2019 I shook it away. It didn\u2019t matter, did it?\nMy eyes wander around my dimly lit apartment room. I crane over at the clock on my desk. It was already past 8:30 at night. Nothing new there, as my unstable sleep schedule had become routine. My eyes wander farther, to an unopened package propped against the dresser. I shut my eyes. I couldn\u2019t look, couldn\u2019t bear to think of what was in that damned package, even though I had a feeling I already knew. It arrived a few weeks ago, some time after Fang\u2019s funeral, addressed to me from her mom. It was small and light, in an otherwise featureless bubble envelope, which meant it could really be only one thing - pictures.\nIt sat by those dressers, almost like it was mocking me, rubbing in my face all my colossal fuck ups that had led to all of this. Every. Single. Day. And yet I couldn\u2019t get rid of it. How could I? Why should I deserve such solace? There was still a part of me deep inside begging me to open it, to look over the captured memories within, reminisce of what was, the fleeting feelings of love I once had. Taken mere months, but so unbearably long ago, I don\u2019t know if I could handle such a sight of when I... when we... were almost happy. Almost. And yet that 'almost' was the highlight of my life. My absolute peak. I roll back over, away from Pandora\u2019s Box. I need to get up at some point, before I find myself in another downward spiral and spend the night starving.\n*Bang Bang Bang*\nSomething raps on the door, either someone very pissed or in a hurry. I push myself out of bed, thankful I'm still wearing my clothes from the day before. Glancing at the clock again, it was almost nine at night. Who the hell would be here of all places, this late? Besides junkies and criminals that is.\n*Bang Bang Bang*\nJunkies and criminals don\u2019t usually knock twice. I guess someone really does want my attention.\nI approach the door and crack it open, peering through into the barely lit hallway. Right in front and center is a short, purple triceratops. She looks at me. Her eyes, full of burning hatred, piercing my very soul.\nShe begins to speak.\n\u201cAnon-\u201d\nI slam the door in her face and press my back against the door. No. No no no no no. Not happening. No way. Nuh uh. Not in sixty-five million years. I reach over and turn the lock and deadbolt.\nShe speaks through the door, \u201cDon\u2019t make this hard on us Anon. We just want to talk.\u201d\nI can barely squeak out a negative response. Bull fucking shit she \u2018just wants to talk.\u2019 How the fuck does she know where I live? Why the fuck is she here? Why today? Why at this time? Us? We? Was there someone else? \n\u201cFine. Have it your way.\u201d She says towards the door. I hear her take a couple steps back.\n\u201cBreak it,\u201d she mutters aside, just loud enough for me to hear.\nOh fuck.\n*Stomp* *Stomp* *SLAM*\nThe impact throws me off of the door and I barely keep my balance.\nOh FUCK.\nI scramble back to the door and engage the chain lock.\n*Stomp* *Stomp* *SLAM*\nThe wood in the door audibly cracks.\nOH FUCK.\nI sprint back towards my desk, scrambling to unlock my phone to call 911. I grab my pocket knife from off the desk, and flick the blade out. Still as sharp as the day I bought it, thankfully.\n*SLAM*\n\u201cNine one one, what is your emergency?\u201d The phone answered. I pick the phone back up and desperately attempt to explain that someone is breaking into my apartment with the intent to kill me.\n*SLAM*\nI sputter my address at them and put the phone down. They won\u2019t be here for a good while, response time in these parts is always slow. Maybe I can stall long enough for them to show up before anything serious happens. Or before I bleed out.\n*SLAM*\nI can hear the door practically explode into useless splinters as a pair of footsteps enters the apartment. My adrenaline was spiking, there was no flight here, only fight. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s only Trish, right? And whoever just knocked down my door. Fuck.\nI peek around the corner and see Trish, standing in the middle of the main room. Our eyes lock, even in the dim light from the moon and the hallway I can feel her seething hatred bearing down on me.\n\u201cCome out from behind that Anon. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d\nHer voice was horrifyingly calm for someone that had just committed breaking and entering. Sounds like she had made up her mind about how this was going to go down a long time ago.\nI step out from around the corner, waving my knife around like a lunatic. \u201cStay back! I know how to use this!\u201d\nShe snorts and grits her teeth. \u201cEven like this you\u2019re still a fucking useless goddamn pain in my ass. Look at this place. You are already dead.\u201d\n\u201cThe fuck do you care then? Get the fuck out and let me waste away,\u201d I shout at her.\nShe growls and her brow furrows even further. \u201c\u2018Let you\u2019? Why should I \u2018let you\u2019 do anything? Last time I \u2018let you\u2019 do anything, my best fucking friend died. Everything was going perfectly fine before you showed up and thought you could just sweep them up off their feet, and take them away from me. I bet you wanted to turn them into a perfect little princess for you to play with, didn\u2019t you? Like the useless fucking man that you are, trying to force people to be who they aren\u2019t.\u201d Hatred oozes from every single word as she steps towards me.\n\u201cShut your fucking mouth!\u201d\n\u201cReed and I will be the only ones that will remember who they really were. What they could have been. Everyone else at Volcano High? They all laughed at Fang. Rejected them. Humiliated them. We could\u2019ve handled that, the three of us. We were going to prove them wrong. Over a year of planning, practicing, coordinating...everything. And now? None of it fucking matters now. Because of you.\u201d Her last word emanates a pure, almost righteous hatred, like even referring to me causes her pain and anguish.\n\u201cI said shut your lying fucking trigger mouth right goddamn now!\u201d My back was against the wall, I hadn\u2019t realized I was backing away from her this entire time.\n\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll try to peel more of my friends away from me?\u201d She steps closer. \u201cMaybe Reed this time? You two were such close friends after all, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\nToo close. Close enough. Had enough. I slash at her stupid fucking throat, not another word will be coming from her tonight, or ever again.\nOr at least that\u2019s what I had hoped would happen.\nI underestimated her height, my knife goes high, and she swiftly ducks under my arm. I go back for another, lower slash.\nThe sound of parting flesh, a scream of agony, the thump of a body against the faux-wood of the apartment, something clattering onto the floor.\nI look down and purple eyes meet mine, barely visible through her lightly matted hair and a pair of brilliant ivory horns that were embedded in my torso.\nOh.\nFuck.\nI reflexively placed my hand against her head, weakly trying to push her off of me. She thrust back in response, digging her horns deeper into me.\n\u201cFUCK\u201d\nI lock eyes with her again. She was smiling. Smug satisfaction.\n\u201cI miss Fang. Reed misses Fang. I\u2019m sure Fang\u2019s parents miss them.\u201d She rattles, sounding incredibly relieved to have finally gored me.\nI can only groan, barely able to mutter a swear towards her.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t your parents kick you out of their house? Will they come looking for you when you stop answering? Do they even send you anything to answer to in the first place? Or will they just write you off as the lost cause you are?\u201d\nThis purple fucking bitch. Probably rehearsed this little speech. Fucking maniac. Fuck.\n\u201cWill anyone here miss you? Will anyone notice your name in the obituaries? Will anyone even bother to write one for you?\u201d\n\u201cS...sh...shut up\u2026\u201d I sputter through pain and gritted teeth, the taste of blood in my mouth.\n\u201cHurts, doesn\u2019t it? Knowing that you were always unwanted and alone. Fang was like that too, you know? Just another body in the crowd, nothing to speak of, completely ignored. I pulled them out of their shell. Helped them see who they truly were. We were going to make wonderful music. Be rich and famous. World-renowned.\u201d Her tone was almost nostalgic, even though half of that shit wouldn\u2019t have happened.\nWait.\nI am a fucking idiot.\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d I muster out, barely\n\u201cYes?\u201d That smug fucking tone of voice momentarily makes me so fucking angry I forget I\u2019m in pain and bleeding profusely.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the reason she was Fang? And not Lucy?\n\u201cI made them realize who they were.\u201d\n\u201cShe hated her entire family...\u201d\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t accept them for who they were\u201d\n\u201cShe hated everyone\u2026\u201d\n \u201cThey also wouldn\u2019t accept her for who they were. Except for me. And Reed. But I was going to make them see, make them all accept them.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so caught up in your bullshit that you can\u2019t see what you\u2019ve done, you fucking retard.\u201d I shout at her, in anger and pain.\n\u201cI helped them-\u201d\n\u201cYou isolated her, tore her away from everyone she had loved and cared about, all for your stupid fucking band.\u201d I eyed the knife on the floor, longing to plunge it into her.\nShe pressed me into the wall again, eliciting another scream.\n\u201cGuess I missed your fucking lungs, just my luck.\u201d The smugness had melted from her voice and the anger had returned.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hating myself over what\u2019s happened, what I could\u2019ve done, but it\u2019s all your fucking fault this happened. You\u2019re the one that turned her into a lonely and depressed fucking reject.\u201d\nShe slammed her head into me, her horns burrowing deeper than before.\n\u201cSHUT. UP.\u201d she screams\n\u201cYOU\u2019RE THE REASON FANG IS DEAD\u201d I scream back, the agony, adrenaline and anger coalescing into a boom I didn\u2019t know my voice was capable of.\nHer horns suddenly yank out of me and I fall to the blood spattered floor, barely able to support myself by my arms. A kick to the rib cage knocks me over. I can feel the handle of the knife brushing against my arm as Trish delivers kick after kick into my gut.\n\u201cHow.\u201d Kick. Reach over. \u201cFucking.\u201d Kick. Just a little further. \u201cDare.\u201d Kick. Come on. \u201cYou.\u201d Got it.\n\u201cTen fucking years I knew her, and you think you know better than me after just a few months?\u201d\n\u201cBlind to your own madness,\u201d I mutter to myself.\n\u201cHmm? What was that? Poor little mumbling skinnie is going to have to speak up.\u201d\n\u201cFucking blind.\u201d\nThe sound of parting flesh, a scream of agony, the thump of a body against the faux-wood of the apartment.\nThis time it wasn\u2019t me.\nThe shock knocks her onto her ass and she clenches the fresh wound. I use what little strength I have left to bring myself over to her. Knife in both hands, I plunge it straight into her. Stomping from behind. There was another with her, right. I use the precious few seconds I have left to inflict more grievous wounds onto her. I receive a savage kick to the gut in return, knocking me off of her and sending me rolling towards the wall, the silhouette of some massive dinosaur looming over us. The sound she makes is some horrific mixture of crying, screaming, choking and gasping, as she flails in the general direction of the second dino. He leans down and scoops her up off the floor.\nI hear sirens. Not sure if they\u2019re real. Hopefully I hit something important regardless.\nThe other dino rushes out of the room, Trish in tow, his footsteps echoing through the hallway. I pray to whatever gods I haven\u2019t pledged to butcher that she doesn\u2019t live long enough to get aid.\nI lay on the floor. Broken. Bleeding. Fading. An all too familiar feeling. Something tells me I won\u2019t be waking up in a hospital bed this time around. It ends here. Is it better than a life full of regret and misery? Guess it doesn\u2019t matter. I won\u2019t be finding out. I close my eyes to the rhythmic sounds of sirens blaring and boots stomping.\n-End-","Title":"A Suprise Visit Alternate","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Trish and Anon","Rating":"Semi-NSFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"SurpriseVisitor"},"A Suprise Visit Chapter 1.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Chapter 1.txt"],"text":"Title: A Suprise Visit \nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Trish, Trish's Mom, Reed and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: Serie\nAuthor: SurpriseVisitor\nSummary: Set after the disastrous events of Ending 1, Anon, while grappling with his own failure, gets a visit one night that he did not expect... but he absolutely needed.\n\n\n1 - A SURPRISE VISIT\n\n-Three months after ENDING 1-\nGraduation came and went with no enthusiasm.

I need to get up at some point, before I find myself in another downward spiral and spend the night starving.\nOne lukewarm shower later and a barely nutritious \u2018breakfast\u2019 in hand, I settle down into the chair at my desk. After a few minutes of blankly staring at my computer monitor, I navigate to an Uzbekistanian cotton weaving forum and begin shitposting anew, hoping nobody mentions Volcano High. The pointless arguments and name calling keep my mind occupied well enough as the hours pass by.\n*Knock* *Knock* *Knock* \nSomething raps on the door. A sound so unfamiliar it barely registers the first time around. I glance at the clock - almost midnight - and back towards the door. Who in their right mind would be here of all places, at this time? Nobody, that\u2019s who. I turn back towards the computer.\n*Knock* *Knock* *Knock* \nAgain? Who on earth would want to talk to me at this hour? I\u2019ve been scorned and all but forgotten by everyone I\u2019ve known in this town. Whatever. I slowly rise to my feet and meander towards the door. I turn the lock and crack open the door, peering into the barely lit hallway. Right in front and center is a short, purple triceratops looking up at me.\n\u201cAnon-\u201d\nI slam the door in her face and press my back against the door. No. No no no no no. Not happening. No way. Nuh uh. Not in sixty-five million years. I reach over and turn the lock and deadbolt.\nShe speaks to me through the door. \u201cAnon, wait. It\u2019s important. \u201d \nBull fucking shit! How the fuck does she know where I live? Why the fuck is she here? Why today? Why at this time? A million worst-case scenarios flashed through my mind, most of them involving those very pointy horns entering me very violently.\n\u201cPlease...I just want to talk to you. Please listen?\u201d Her voice wavers softly. Was she pleading with me? Why?\nI take a few seconds to let the panic filter out, then unlock the door and open it again. I had seen her when she was angry before - she had never been one to stray from showing it before after all - but for whatever reason she wasn\u2019t screaming at me or staring daggers at me or anything of the sort. Why?\nI poke my head out past the door frame and look up and down the hallway. Empty except for her, accompanied only by the soft buzz of fluorescent lighting. At least I was right about nobody in their right mind showing up here at this time, she must be completely batshit to come here completely alone. I look back to Trish. Her eyes plead with me like a puppy, almost like when-\nNO.\n\u201cAlright, fine,\u201d I barely mutter through the confusion while attempting to scrub the previous thought from my mind.\nTrish steps into my squalor apartment, and I close and lock the door behind her. \nI flip a switch and the main room lights flicker on. The last few months have not been kind to it, the sickly pale light illuminating left over dirty dishes, trash bags, dust and cobwebs. A small part of me is thankful that I had cleaned at least somewhat recently. The last thing I need is the landlord accosting me over bug problems. \nI wander back to my chair as Trish approaches my unkempt bed. She goes to sit, but hesitates. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I\u2026\u201d She asks, trailing off while motioning towards the bed.\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d I reply. As she lowers herself down, a thousand questions circle around in my mind, but one stands out. What on earth could be so important to track me down and visit my apartment in Skin Row, at midnight? She looks at the floor, and opens her mouth to speak. Only the slightest hint of a syllable escapes her mouth before it closes. She grimaces, as if even finding the words she wants to say is causing her pain. Oh shit, is this about-\n\u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\nI forcibly close my mouth, just barely saving myself from shouting \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Is this about the presentation? Why would she even bother with this, here and now? \n\u201cI...I fucked up\u2026\u201d She trembles, hands gripping the edge of the bed, tears threatening to break the dam.  \u201cI fucked everything up...for all of us\u2026\u201d \n\u201cTrish, I\u2026\u201d\nIf Trish heard me, she didn\u2019t show it. \u201cI fucked it all up and blamed you. Not once did I think I was doing something wrong until...until it was too late.\u201d She barely chokes back a sob and a single tear rolls down her cheek, her breathing heavy and labored, as if she had just taken a bullet. Her head raises and she locks her freshly wet eyes with me. Silence follows, the very world around us quiet with anticipation. \n\u201cTrish, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d She looks back down, taking a few moments to collect herself. \n\u201cI was desperate, Anon. I was convinced our big break was just around the corner. That we were going to go from rejects to superstars, as long as everything went as planned. But\u2026\u201d Her voice calms, but it still aches with sorrow.\n\u201cHave you ever planned something, meticulously running through the details over and over again, completely convinced that it was flawless? That no matter what happened, it was going to work out exactly how you envision? Only to have it completely fall apart at a moments notice, and that, when you look back on it, you can\u2019t imagine how you could have possibly thought it was a good idea - that it would have never worked in a million years - and if you had told someone else about that plan they would\u2019ve said exactly that?\u201d\nWhat happened at Rock Bottom immediately comes to mind. I visibly cringe at the thought, sink further into my chair and weakly reply, \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd the more desperate you are, the worse the plans become, and the harder it becomes to think properly, until\u2026\u201d She trembles again, unable to finish her sentence, but I have a feeling I know what she\u2019s getting at. This must be the first time I\u2019ve ever related to Trish before. \nHer voice lowers to a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for blaming you. For trying to hurt you. I just...couldn\u2019t stand the thought of my plans going wrong. Of my band failing. Of Fang leaving me. It wasn\u2019t your fault. Everyone thinks it was, but...\u201d A single sob creaks out of her. Her voice lowers even further, her final sentence barely audible. \u201cNone of it was.\u201d \nThe dam bursts. She buries her head into her arms and lets out a shriek of pure agony. The pain, the anguish, the acknowledgement of her failures coalesce into a complete meltdown. Mere minutes ago I thought she hated me with all her life. How long had she been grappling with this? Is this even my business? Do I even-\nFuck it.\nI seat myself next to Trish on the bed. She doesn\u2019t move her head, but our eyes lock for a split second. \n\u201cHow long has this been on your mind?\u201d I ask her. \nShe can barely manage to speak through her sobs. \u201cEver since the funeral.\u201d She shudders and attempts to steady her breathing. \u201cFang\u2019s dad said something...I don\u2019t think I was meant to hear it but I did. It hurt, Anon. More than anything had ever hurt before.\u201d She lets out another round of sobs. \u201cIt broke me. It was too much. I\u2026wasn\u2019t in a good place...\u201d She trails off, raising her head ever so slightly and glancing around the apartment, and changes the subject. \u201cYou probably haven\u2019t been in the best of places either.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been pretty shit.\u201d Seriously? Is that really the best response you have? \nTrish seems to calm down after a few minutes, her deep sobbing replaced with sniffles and sighs. She looks up at me, her eyes wet and reddened, her face stained, and asks the one question I was absolutely not prepared to answer.\n\u201cDid they love you?\u201d \nDo I know the answer to that question? Can I know the answer to that question? Would an answer make her feel worse? Would not having an answer make her feel worse? Do I care about making her feel worse? Yes? Fuck. \n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\nDon\u2019t know? Don\u2019t think I should answer? Don\u2019t think it\u2019s your business? Don\u2019t think it matters? \n\u201cI think they did,\u201d I finally reply.\n\u201cDid you love them too?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d\nTrish buries her face back into her hands and bursts into tears. Through all the slurring and sobbing I can barely make out her repeating \u2018I ruined everything\u2019 over and over. With only the slightest hint of hesitation I wrap my arm around her shoulder and pull her close. \nI spend the next several minutes attempting to console Trish. Slowly but surely her breathing slows, as do the flow of her tears as she tentatively rests against my arm. She was easily in one of the most unstable and vulnerable moments of her life - my next words would probably be some of the most important ones I would say for a long time. \n\u201cTrish...you did fuck up.\u201d Good start.\n\u201cBut I did love them. And they loved me. I saw a side of them that I don\u2019t think anyone saw for a long time. I was with them when they were at their lowest. I made mistakes. Said and did things I shouldn\u2019t have. Didn\u2019t support them when they needed it. I just wanted to keep my head down and avoid getting any attention, even though everything was telling me that it wasn\u2019t going to fly, that I was going to need to step up to the occasion. But I couldn\u2019t - I wouldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d\nTrish is completely silent, staring at me with those beautiful purple eyes, fully focused on every word coming out of my mouth. \n\u201cDon\u2019t bear all the blame by yourself. I fucked up too.\u201d\nShe presses into my arm and starts crying again, but this time is different. Just as she no longer bears the blame by herself, sorrow alone no longer fills her tears. She knew she couldn\u2019t do this alone, but now she doesn\u2019t have to. \n\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispers. Nothing more needs to be said. \nOur embrace continues for some time, with some occasional small talk sprinkled in, although there wasn\u2019t much the two of us had done in the past few months that wasn\u2019t painful or depressing. I had almost forgotten how nice it is to simply feel another person and talk to them. \n\nTrish stretches and lets out a powerful yawn.\n\u201cI guess I should get going. Thank you so much for everything, Anon.\u201d She stands up and starts to walk over to the door. I glance over at the clock - 3 AM.\n\u201cTrish, I...how did you even get here?\u201d She turns around.\n\u201cI walked. Why?\u201d\n\u201cRight, ignoring the fact that that\u2019s insane and you probably shouldn\u2019t have done that, walking around Skin Row at three AM is even more insane and you definitely shouldn\u2019t do that. You\u2019re free to nap for a bit, I woke up late so I won\u2019t be needing it for now.\u201d \nShe appears to mull over the possibility for a moment. \u201cAnon, are you sure...\u201d\n\u201cFriends don\u2019t let friends wander Skin Row at three in the morning.\u201d Her smile noticeably widens at this comment, and she agrees. I sit back in my chair as Trish gets comfortable, and consider turning back to the computer. Is shitposting really what I need right now? I am suddenly very aware of just how filthy this apartment is. \nThe next few hours are a constant battle to balance not waking Trish and actually getting things in order. At the very least, the dishes are cleaned, trash was collected and is ready to be thrown out, and a number of surfaces have been sweeped and scrubbed down to an acceptable level. It feels good to have actually gotten something done that wasn\u2019t shitposting or sustaining myself. \nI settle back into my chair, admiring the fruits of my labor, and take some time to reflect. I glance over at Trish, still peacefully sleeping as the early morning light filters into the apartment. We had been through a lot, both today and over the last few months. Hell, that entire semester was a mess from start to finish. But even after all of that, maybe\u2026\nMaybe it\u2019ll end up okay.","Title":"A Suprise Visit","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Trish, Trish's Mom, Reed and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"Serie","Author":"SurpriseVisitor","Summary":"Set after the disastrous events of Ending 1, Anon, while grappling with his own failure, gets a visit one night that he did not expect... but he absolutely needed."},"A Suprise Visit Chapter 2.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Chapter 2.txt"],"text":"A cacophony of groans and yawns interrupts my light shitposting endeavours on an American building demolition forum. I look over to see Trish sprawled out across my bed, deeply focusing as she stretches every limb in a different direction simultaneously. A sigh reverberates throughout her entire body, every limb goes slack and she opens her eyes. \r\n\u201cMorning,\u201d I say, very amused at her little routine. \r\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she yawns in response, a wide smile plastered on her face that I couldn\u2019t help but mimic. It\u2019s probably been months since I woke up with such a smile on my face. \r\n\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d Trish sighs, sitting upright. Damnit, mumbling. \r\n\u201cHave a good sleep?\u201d \r\n\u201cYeah, big time.\u201d \r\n\u201cGood to hear.\u201d Trish stands up and stretches again, joints audibly popping. \r\n\u201cThink I\u2019m good to go. Thanks again, Anon. For everything.\u201d I rise from my chair and start to move towards the door, but Trish intercepts me with a very sudden hug. I return the embrace, wrapping myself in the little purple dino. Very little, in fact. I knew she was short, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been able to make such a direct comparison until now. The tip of her back horns barely breach my chin, her face completely buried in my chest. And her chest...how much is that sweater hiding? \r\nEasy Anon, there\u2019s a time and a place for that. Not now.\r\n\u201cActually, before I go, give me your phone number.\u201d We exchange contact information and I walk her out of my apartment, wishing her a safe trip as she returns to her home. \r\nAs I sink back into my desk chair, it doesn\u2019t take me long to realize just how quiet it is in here. How empty it is. Fuck. Should\u2019ve told her to come back soon. Should I have? Or would that have been too much? Maybe-\r\nStop. Relax. I\u2019ve got time. We\u2019ve got time. I glance over at the calendar, my father\u2019s words echoing in my mind.\r\n\u201cOnce the lease is done, Anon, either college or the service. I don\u2019t care which.\u201d \r\nI spend a bit more time finishing the cleaning I had started earlier, now that I didn\u2019t have to worry about disrupting somebody's sleep. No more trash, no more dirty dishes, and everything else - while not completely spotless - was definitely a vast improvement. And a nice way to keep my mind occupied. \r\nMy pocket buzzes, startling me. It hasn\u2019t done that in ages. It\u2019s a text from Trish.\r\n\u201cyo\u201d\r\n\u201cYo\u201d I reply.\r\n\u201cYou make it back?\u201d\r\n\u201cye\u201d\r\n\u201cCool\u201d\r\n\u201cHow did you get my address anyway?\u201d\r\n\u201cfangs dad, wasnt easy\u201d\r\nWe converse for a while longer, straying from anything too important or depressing. It wasn\u2019t as nice as when she was here in the flesh, but it was a close second, and preferable to the crushing loneliness of the past few months. \r\n\r\n---\r\nIt had been a few days since I last saw Trish. I can\u2019t stand the thought of being alone but the thought of fucking up and pushing her too far keeps me in check. It\u2019ll all be okay, right? She just needs time. We had exchanged a number of texts in the meantime, mostly doing our best to keep each other\u2019s spirits up, or at least not down. Buzzing from my phone - a text from Trish. Better enjoy this conversation, cause the day\u2019s only downhill after it\u2019s over.\r\n\u201cyo\u201d\r\n\u201cYo\u201d\r\n\u201ccan u come over when u arent busy\u201d\r\n\u201cSure\u201d\r\nThis is an incredibly welcome surprise. Her address pops up on my screen, and I enter it into Gruugle Maps. A good thirty minute walk in the sweltering late-August heat, but I don\u2019t care. I get to see Trish again. I gather a few belongings and practically rush out the door, almost forgetting to lock it behind me. \u2018When you aren\u2019t busy\u2019 means \u2018as soon as possible\u2019, even I know that. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI look over Trish\u2019s house, now in front of me. It\u2019s fairly ordinary, a bit on the smaller side and with no cars in the driveway, but then again Trish had never mentioned any siblings. Or parents, for that matter.  I take a quick peek at my phone as I approach. Twenty-five minutes walking, that\u2019s good time. I quickly rap on the door to announce my presence, and am immediately responded to.\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d I hear Trish call from inside. I pop open the door and close it behind me. The living room is also fairly generic. Flat screen TV on some drawers, coffee table, couch, side table, a couple of random ornaments and knick-knacks hung up on the wall. Trish is laying upright against the center of the couch, sprawled out and attempting to take up as much space as possible. It admittedly isn\u2019t a lot, but she\u2019s trying. \r\n\u201cYou good? You look like you just ran a marathon.\u201d It was then I realized just how hot and out of breath I was. \r\n\u201cYeah I...it\u2019s hot out. You got drinks?\u201d\r\n\u201cBottles in the fridge. Grab me one too.\u201d\r\nI retrieve a pair of water bottles, passing one to her as I plop down onto one of the cushions Trish is failing to fully occupy. I crack the top off and slurp down the quenching goodness. Oh, sweet water. I settle back into the couch, sighing in relief. This might be the best water I\u2019ve ever tasted. Couch isn\u2019t half bad either. And the air conditioning is right on me.\r\n\u201cForgetting something, mister narrator?\u201d Trish asks playfully. I really need to get a handle on that. \r\n\u201cNot at all. Already got you your water, remember?\u201d A plastic cap bounces off of my head in response. \r\n\u201cJackass,\u201d she giggles. \r\n\u201cAnyways, what\u2019s up?\u201d I ask, slightly shifting towards her.\r\n\u201cI was in a bit of a bad funk. I\u2019m better now, you can go,\u201d she smirks. \r\n\u201cAnd subject me to another half hour of grueling summer heat? Harsh.\u201d I move to get up from the couch, but a yellow sleeve wraps around my elbow and yanks me back down.\r\n\u201cNo. Stay.\u201d Trish rests her head on my shoulder while gripping my arm. I wrap my arm around her shoulder and pull her close, and she sighs mirthfully. \r\n\u201cWanna put something on? That\u2019s a nice TV.\u201d\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re all I want right now.\u201d \r\nWe stay like this for some time. Not sure how long, but it honestly doesn\u2019t matter - this is the best I\u2019ve felt in a long time. \r\n\u201cAnon\u2026\u201d Trish suddenly speaks up, doubt and anxiety in her voice.\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but echo her tone. What she was about to say wasn\u2019t going to be happy.\r\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\r\n\u201cBecause you asked me to?\u201d I reply, almost by reflex. Nice one, fucktard.\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2026\u201d She sighs. \u201cWhy are you here for me? I thought you hated me. After everything I did\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cTrish, the stuff with the auditorium...it was bad, but it\u2019s long behind me now. Behind us.\u201d\r\n\u201cAnd everything else? When I yelled at you, treated you like dirt, threatened to hurt you?\u201d\r\n\u201cBehind us, Trish,\u201d I insisted. \u201cIt was a hard time for all of us. What happened is gonna haunt us to our fucking graves. Hell, it was going to even if we weren\u2019t involved at all.\u201d Trish pressed closer into me and shivers. \r\n\u201cYou know, if it weren\u2019t for you...I wouldn\u2019t be here\u2026\u201d What...oh shit.\r\n\u201cThat day, I was certain you were going to yell at me, turn me away, tell me you hated me, or something like that. That even if I had gotten the truth off of my chest, you would\u2019ve used it to hurt me more, and that I would\u2019ve deserved it. I would\u2019ve left, gone outside and, I don\u2019t know, got hit by a fucking truck or something.\u201d Trish sniffles, tears starting to fall.\r\n\u201cAgain and again, I think I have it all figured out, and then you show up and everything falls apart. What am I missing?\u201d \r\n\u201cAnything that can go wrong will go wrong. And I\u2019m certainly a whole lot of anything.\u201d What does that even mean? Trish weakly snickers at the absurdity of that statement and leans into me further. \r\n\u201cThat better not be a quote from some cartoon or something.\u201d She tries her best to not sound sad. \r\n\u201cWhat? Come on, everyone knows Murphasaur\u2019s Law!\u201d I throw my hands up in a quiet faux-anger, and immediately realize my hands are the only thing keeping me upright. I fall backwards into the arm rest and Trish falls with me onto my chest. Trish finds no issue with this and decides to take the opportunity to wrap her arms around me. We stay like this for a bit, and Trish\u2019s tears dry soon enough. I decide to ask a question that\u2019s been on my mind for a while and also steers the subject away from what we were just talking about. \r\n\u201cHow did you find those pictures of me anyway?\u201d\r\n\u201cA few very late nights sleuthing on Grugbook trying to figure out what had even happened at Rock Bottom in the first place. Once I figured that out, I just had to ask around. The person I found who actually had the pictures practically threw them at me. He really didn\u2019t seem to like you very much, and the idea of a \u2018repeat\u2019 was very appealing to him. After that, I just fucked with the lens the day of the presentation, slipped the pictures in when Reed asked me to help, and bam - you go back to being some nobody loner and everything goes back to normal.\u201d \r\n\u201cExcept not only did that last part not happen, you ran face first into Principal Spears\u2019 gargantuan hand. I\u2019m a little surprised he didn\u2019t pop you.\u201d\r\n\u201cHe was actually incredibly gentle, which made it even scarier knowing he could pop me at any moment, but was just choosing not to.\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s a little surprising that we\u2019re able to look back on high school without completely breaking down. The TV flicks on and Trish navigates to some channel. The volume was barely audible but suitable enough for background noise. Trish nuzzles into my chest and I start stroking her back, subtly rocking her. She falls asleep rather quickly, and I\u2019m left in the same room as a sleeping Trish for the second time this week. Certainly quite the gear shift after wasting away for the better part of four months. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe front door knob rattles and turns, and a pair of footsteps stumble in. Fang\u2019s dad immediately appears in the forefront of my mind. Oh fuck not again, and this was worse too - she\u2019s sleeping on top of me! A dozen different panicked ideas flood into my mind, paralyzing me on the spot. They walk in between the TV and the coffee table, and I come face to face with who I can only assume is Trish\u2019s mom. She\u2019s wearing a sharp business suit and holding a bulky suitcase that could easily clobber me if needed. Her resemblance to Trish is obvious - a short, purple triceratops, purple eyes, dark purple hair that curled onto itself, quite well equipped, and probably just as temperamental - almost carbon copies, except that she was leaning towards the thicker side. We lock eyes and she takes a deep breath. I brace myself and hope my skull survives the impending debacle intact. She looks back and forth between Trish and I multiple times, before slowly releasing her breath. Her expression softens ever so slightly.\r\n\u201cYou stay as long as you like, sk- sweetie,\u201d she whispers with barely restrained anger before walking off into the kitchen. \r\nFucking hell how am I still alive. I glance down at Trish, who thankfully didn\u2019t budge an inch during that little exchange. Well, I\u2019m sure as hell not moving for a while, might as well get comfy. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA familiar mess of groans and yawns meets my ears once again as Trish sprawls herself out as much as possible. \r\n\u201cOooof. Man, you\u2019re comfy,\u201d Trish yawns before going slack. \r\n\u201cY-you too.\u201d Goddamnit. Wait, that might have been smooth this time.\r\n\u201cWhat time is it,\u201d Trish mutters while grabbing her phone. \u201cAh shit. Late,\u201d punctuated by Trish\u2019s stomach loudly growling. When was the last time I ate? Breakfast?\r\n\u201cYou got food here?\u201d \r\n\u201cMeh. Too lazy.\u201d \r\n\u201cSo we\u2019re starving tonight?\u201d \r\n\u201cNo, you idiot, we\u2019re getting fast food. Come on.\u201d Trish takes an agonizingly long time to lift herself off of me and into a sitting position. \u201cWe leave now, we should be able to get there before it closes.\u201d\r\n\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019m up.\u201d I open the door for Trish and close it behind me. \u201cThe hell are we going anyway?\u201d \r\n\u201cRocko Bell, it\u2019s just a few minutes away.\u201d Trish sets off into a jog that I am woefully unready for. I can\u2019t even keep pace with her, arriving at the Rocko Bell a couple of minutes after her, completely out of breath.\r\n\u201cDamn, I thought I was out of shape.\u201d I try to muster a response but I can only quietly seethe in between breaths. We quickly order some food and sit down, and then tear into our meals after they arrive, finishing in what is probably record time. Trish and I both moan in post-meal ecstasy; it probably wasn\u2019t even that good, but in the moment it was heavenly nectar. \r\n\u201cFfffuck.\u201d I raise an eyebrow at Trish. \u201cNow we gotta walk back,\u201d she groans. \r\n\u201cHang on, I know a guy.\u201d I dial a number into my phone for the taxi service. A voice responds.\r\n\u201cCity taxi service.\u201d\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the Rocko Bell, can you-\u201d\r\n\u201cGot it.\u201d The phone hangs up. Trish looks at me, incredibly confused.\r\n\u201cYou know there\u2019s more than one Rocko Bell, Right? How would-\u201d She\u2019s interrupted by the squeal of rubber from outside. \r\n\u201cThere\u2019s our ride. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Trish attempts a word of protest, but I\u2019m already opening the door for her. A grimy looking taxi waits on the curbside, the grimy velociraptor inside looking at us expectantly. I pop open the rear taxi door and lead Trish in, then settle myself on the other seat. \r\n\u201cMy favorite skinnie\u2019s still kickin\u2019, I\u2019ll be damned. Where\u2019re you two headed this time of night?\u201d \r\n\u201cMy place,\u201d Trish responds curtly, offering the driver her address, still in a state of sheer confusion. \r\n\u201cReal short ride. You got it.\u201d The driver chuckles at his own remark as it flies over Trish\u2019s head. The taxi peels out and does a one-eighty on the spot, then hurtles its way down to Trish\u2019s house. Less than a minute later the taxi smoothly comes to a stop outside of Trish\u2019s house. We exit the taxi and I start to move towards the front door, only to be intercepted by Trish. She wraps me into a rough, almost violent hug, and I respond in kind, squeezing her and almost lifting her off the ground. \r\n\u201cSo I guess this means I\u2019m not staying?\u201d\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind, but I\u2019d rather...not strain my mom\u2019s good will any further. Plus we had a good time tonight, right?\u201d\r\n\u201cOf course, of course. See you soon?\u201d\r\n\u201cDefinitely. I feel like three days was a bit too long for my liking.\u201d We hold the embrace for a little while longer before breaking off and saying our goodbyes. I slide back into the taxi and the driver grins. \r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s a start. And after the clusterfuck you went through, I\u2019m surprised you came out the other end at all, much less in one piece. Skin Row?\u201d I nod and the taxi takes off in the direction of my apartment. \r\nThe taxi stops a few blocks short of my apartment. \u201cEnd of the line, skinnie.\u201d I hand him what\u2019s probably enough to pay for the fare and make my way back to my apartment. The first time in months I\u2019ve opened the door to a clean and orderly dwelling. You did good, Anon. Time to collapse on the bed and pass out. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTrish walks into my apartment once again, having texted earlier about visiting. \r\n\u201cWelcome back to Casa del Anon, this time not a complete fucking mess.\u201d \r\n\u201cYeah, and neither are you, good job.\u201d Yeah, you\u2019re not getting away with that. I step behind and sling my arms around her. I\u2019m not exactly strong enough to lift her up and threaten to throw her, but it\u2019s enough to elicit a high-pitched yelp and a glare that says \u2018if I didn\u2019t know you I\u2019d gore you on the spot\u2019. \r\nWe crack open a couple of drinks, have a seat on the bed and start chatting about this and that. Trish\u2019s mom almost chewed her out for not only having a skinnie over, but sleeping on him right in the living room. We tentatively agreed that, whatever happened between us, Trish\u2019s mom would probably have to get over her \u2018implicit biases\u2019 at some point if I were to continue being alive. I\u2019ll let Trish take point on that one, thank you very much. Trish had made an effort to reach out to Reed, and suggested that I do too. Maybe after you warm him up for me? I know he\u2019s chill, but it\u2019s still a lot to work through. \r\nOur conversation hits a lul at some point, and we take a moment to just appreciate the moment. \r\n\u201cAnon\u2026?\u201d Trish speaks up. That damn tone again.\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026?\u201d That damn tone\u2026\r\n\u201cWhat...exactly happened? After the prom concert?\u201d I immediately cringe, every single word I said to Fang that night and the night after flashing through my mind. This was not my first time grappling with this; it had happened almost every single day since prom. At first I didn\u2019t really understand what had happened, surely I couldn\u2019t have fucked up that badly all by myself, right? But day by day I slowly came to realize just how badly I fucked up. Every word, every intonation, every action added to the fuck-up pile. My selfishness, my apathy, my aloofness all contributed. Surely, if I didn\u2019t care then Fang didn\u2019t need-\r\n\u201cAnon? I\u2019m sorry, we don\u2019t have to, I just thought\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat? No, no, I\u2019m just...collecting my thoughts. There\u2019s...a lot.\u201d \r\nI hesitantly start to retread through the events of that night. I find Fang crying in the auditorium, and then my first fuck-up: Trying to comfort Fang by telling them that nothing mattered. I bring them home, and then my second fuck-up: Rattling off about fucking video game knowledge while they lay behind me. Third, fourth, fifth, through to a thousandth fuck-ups: Not handling the Naomi situation properly, and even just implying that what she did was okay and that I was only doing what she wanted. Final fuck-up: Letting Fang use me like the tool they knew I were the following night.\r\nBy the end of it all, I\u2019m on the verge of tears and Trish\u2019s face is buried into my arm. \r\n\u201cAnd the entire time, I was convinced that if they saw the world the way I did, and they stopped caring about all that shit, they\u2019d come out the other end just fine. Fuck.\u201d The final word and the following silence is a fitting punctuation to the recollection of my greatest failures. I hope I never have to say all that shit again. We sit in that silence for a little while, letting those nights weigh over us like a blanket of fog. The worst passes and we\u2019re eventually done wrestling with our own thoughts. \r\n\u201cSo, uh\u2026\u201d Trish\u2019s eyes catch something and she tries to move the conversation elsewhere.\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in that package?\u201d \r\n\u201cPackage? What-\u201d\r\nOH FUCK.\r\nMy brain immediately shuts down and I freeze like a deer in headlights. \r\n\u201cThat one.\u201d Trish stands up. Stop. She walks over to the dressers. Stop. She picks up the package. Stop. She walks back. Stop. She sits down. Stop. She starts to turn it over in her hands. STOP.\r\nI finally wrestle control back over myself and violently snatch the bubble envelope from her hands while letting out an unintelligible shout. \r\n\u201cAnon, what the fuck?\u201d \r\nI can\u2019t let this be open. I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t. I don\u2019t deserve what\u2019s inside. I don\u2019t deserve what it would show. I don\u2019t deserve those happier times. I don\u2019t deserve the briefest respite-\r\n\u201cAnon!\u201d Trish borderline shouts at me. I snap out of my funk and look at her, face full of concern. \r\nTrish. Here. With me. Together. Maybe\u2026\r\nRelax. Collect your thoughts. Take the plunge. \r\nI shakily flip the bubble envelope over in my hands and bring it in front of us, the tracking information on display. Sent by Fang\u2019s mom, Samantha, and sent from Fang\u2019s address. Every letter raises my heart rate further. \r\n\u201cHow long have you had this?\u201d \r\n\u201cIt came in a few weeks after the funeral. I don\u2019t know why she sent them to me, but she did.\u201d My voice is shaky, I can barely manage to speak.\r\n\u201cAnd...what\u2019s in it?\u201d The worry in Trish\u2019s voice reaches a peak. \r\n\u201cPictures,\u201d I whisper, on the verge of vomiting. \r\n\u201cA-anon, we...we don\u2019t need to-\u201d\r\n\u201cNo...no. We do. I\u2026we...fuck.\u201d My heart is in my throat. I can barely breathe. But I need this. \r\n\u201cWe won\u2019t get a better opportunity.\u201d\r\nI flip the bubble envelope back over and move towards the seal. Trish\u2019s hand moves with mine. A tinge of hope. We\u2019ll do this together, as one. We break the seal, and the flap lazily unfolds itself. My heart is going to explode. My lungs are going to collapse. I reach towards the opening, but stop short. Trish\u2019s hand intertwines with mine. We reach towards the opening. We look at each other. I try to keep a straight face, but my eyes show the sheer terror I\u2019m experiencing. She smiles and nods, mouthing \u2018It\u2019ll be okay.\u2019 \r\nIt\u2019ll be okay.\r\nWe reach into the bubble envelope, and latch on to the small stack of paper inside. Trish keeps my hand steady as we pull it out and place it on the envelope. Our hands are covering the top picture. The first of many. Trish slowly moves our hands out of the way. \r\nNaomi and Naser striking a pose together, Naomi looking ecstatic in her beautiful red prom dress and Naser looking cool and collected in his white suit-jacket and aviators. The last pose they would ever strike together. \r\nNaser and I in our ugly suits together. I would be the last thing Naser sees just days later.\r\nNaomi and I posing together, the both of us trying to not look uncomfortable. Her plans for Fang and I had failed.\r\nTears fall from my eyes, threatening to forever damage the last physical memories I had of them. I choke back a sob, but continue going through the pile. Many repeats of before with slightly different poses. \r\nFang\u2019s dad, Ripley, and I, his massive claw digging into my shoulder. How he must hate me for all this.\r\nWe finally get to the bottom of the pile.\r\nWait, where is-\r\n\"...That is no way to talk to your mother, young lady!\" Ripley\u2019s voice booms across the insides of my skull. Fang practically yanks me out of the house right after.\r\nThe dam breaks. The anguish and sorrow I had bottled up for months explodes out of me in a mortifying wail of pure grief.\r\n\u201cWHY?\u201d\r\nI collapse into the bed, screaming as the pictures scatter onto the floor. \r\n\u201cWHY?\u201d \r\nI curl myself up defensively, but nothing can protect me from the enemy inside.\r\n\u201cWHY?\u201d \r\nTrish tries to help, but there\u2019s nothing she can do.\r\n\u201cWHY?\u201d \r\nI know why, but I scream anyway.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u201cAnon?\u201d\r\nMy throat and lungs burn, my chest aches, my eyes sting, my ears ring, my nose is blocked, my vision is blurry, my breathing is ragged, my limbs are numb, my mind is foggy...Fang is gone.\r\n\u201cTri-\u201d I try to call out, but am cut off by a vicious cough. My throat sears in pain. A water bottle touches my lips, and I gratefully take in the drink. \r\n\u201cOh! Thank God you\u2019re alive.\u201d I wish I wasn\u2019t. \r\n\u201cPlease...don\u2019t say that Anon.\u201d Sorry, Trish. She offers more water and I gladly accept. \r\n\u201cWhat...happened?\u201d I dare ask. \r\n\u201cYou screamed so much you passed out. I think.\u201d Sounds about right. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been shot before. This is worse, by far.\u201d \r\nTrish spends several minutes giving me water as I slowly recover. I\u2019m so exhausted, but I know I won\u2019t be sleeping it off any time soon.\r\n\u201cTrish...thank you. I would\u2019ve never been able to do that by myself.\u201d\r\n\u201cAre you sure you should be thanking me? You look\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cYeah, I feel worse. This\u2019ll hurt for...a long, long time. But it\u2019s better now than later. I\u2019ll get better. And on the other side, I\u2019ll end up a better person. Or something like that.\u201d I groan as I struggle to sit upright, all kinds of muscles and old wounds aching and cramping from the tension. I motion to the photos scattered on the ground, asking Trish to pick them up. I\u2019d help, but moving hurts. She carefully stacks all the photos up and places them back in the envelope, placing it off to the side. \r\nI feel like a corpse, inside and out. All I have left of those fateful nights are memories. I feel like an idiot too - how could I have forgotten that argument? All this time, I was terrified of opening it, of reliving the moments within, and the one thing that made me happy wasn\u2019t even in there. What a fucking joke. \r\n\u201cAnon, I\u2019m still here for you.\u201d\r\n\u201cShit, I wasn\u2019t mumbling, was I?\u201d\r\n\u201cNo, but you\u2019re definitely dwelling. Alone.\u201d\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d \r\nI spill my broken heart out to Trish for the third time tonight. She\u2019s remarkably calm as I rocket back and forth between random memories and details of my relationships and interactions with Fang, Naomi and Naser. Some things I had never been able to tell anyone, some things I never intended to tell anyone, and some things that were better left unsaid. I feel a little better after all of it, although admittedly not much.\r\n\u201cThere are no second chances. Just have to live with the fuck-ups,\u201d I conclude, unsure if it really connects to what I was saying earlier. Not that it really matters at this point. I look over at Trish. She seems to be soaking in every word I\u2019m saying. Purple hair, purple eyes, purple scales, purple tail, purple lips. She\u2019s so fucking purple. Kinda pretty too\u2026\r\n\u201cAnon you\u2019re mumbling,\u201d Trish blurts, blushing lightly. I place my hand on her cheek and bring her eyes to mine, causing her to blush even harder. \r\nOur lips meet and the world around us melts. Doesn't matter, we don't need it right now. All I need is right in front of me. A blissful eternity wrapped in a scant few seconds, I curse the passage of time itself for not allowing this to last forever. Our lips part ways with a quiet pop. I would complain more, but now I get to resume looking into those beautiful purple eyes. Her eyes that are betraying the moment, a shell-shocked expression occupying her face.\r\n\"Everything okay, Trish?\" I whisper to her. \r\nEverything was not okay - she looks like she just witnessed a high speed car wreck. \r\nShe tightly grips the edges of my jacket as a tear falls down her face. A sorrowful gasp breaks her silence. A powerful sob racks her body and her tears start to wet my sleeve. \r\n\"Easy now, you can talk to-\"\r\nA terrible screech conveying a hundred different emotions cuts me off and Trish starts screaming into me. \r\n\"Trish? Please-\"\r\nNothing I say gets through to her. I need to do something, she\u2019s done that for me. \r\nI spend the next several minutes trying everything I can think of to calm her down even a little bit, but nothing works. Did a kiss really cause all of this? \r\nA violent coughing fit takes sudden hold of Trish, and she's caught between a flurry of hacks, sobs and gasps for air as her body desperately tries to regulate her breathing. \r\n\"Why\u2026I...We...\" Her voice is hoarse and she can barely speak without coughing. She stares off into the wall, trembling. \r\n\"We\u2026Why...\" She can barely manage a syllable at a time through heavy, ragged breaths. Is she going to be okay after that? Is she even thinking straight?\r\n\"We\u2026fucked up\u2026\" she shivers. \"Naomi\u2026\" she stutters. \"Naser\u2026\" \r\n\"We\u2026\" Trish was quiet now, at the bottom of her depressive spiral - I hope - only a cold despair left in her voice.\r\n\"We fucked everything up...they didn\u2019t get a second chance, so why do we?\"\r\nA dagger of ice pierces my heart. I open my mouth but no words come out. The words bounce around in my skull a hundred times. Say something. Anything. Fix this. My mind rattles off a dozen different things to say and every single one of them is atrocious. Maybe I should just be quiet. \r\n\u201cThey would want us to have one.\u201d Or I could say that. \r\nWe sit in silence and I desperately pray that what just forced itself from my mouth wasn\u2019t completely retarded.\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026you\u2019re right.\u201d What? Trish is still visibly upset, but she seems determined to get her thoughts out.\r\n\u201cYou said it yourself, we\u2019re gonna take this shit to our graves. It\u2019s never gonna leave us. We\u2019ve been wallowing in it this entire time, and we\u2019ve got the rest of our lives to wallow in it. When was the last time we looked forward?\u201d \r\n\u201cWell, I was certainly looking forward to today.\u201d\r\n\u201cThat...was disgustingly sappy.\u201d \r\n\u201cBet you liked hearing it.\u201d\r\nTrish only groans in response, but I can see the slightest hint of a smile on her face. \r\n\u201cCome on Anon, I\u2019m trying to be serious.\u201d \r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been serious all day. I really need to lighten up before my heart stops.\u201d I get up and grab us a couple more drinks from the fridge, then practically throw myself onto the bed.\r\n\u201cUgh, fuck,\u201d I groan. Everything still kind of hurts. \u201cNot that I\u2019m rushing you, but how much longer you plan on staying?\u201d\r\n\u201cHm. Dunno.\u201d\r\n\u201cYour mom\u2019s probably gonna be pissed if you\u2019re not back before she is.\u201d\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d A hint of anger makes its way into Trish\u2019s voice. \r\n\u201cAlright, fair enough.\u201d Don\u2019t want to touch that any more than I have to.\r\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s just...you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve been able to talk to about any of this. And besides, I\u2019m an adult. I can make my own decisions. If she has a problem with that then-\u201d\r\n\u201cEasy, it\u2019s not gonna come to that.\u201d  She falls backwards into my chest, sighing some unidentifiable mix of emotion. She looks over at me. I smile and she smiles back. I obnoxiously waggle my eyebrows.\r\n\u201cYou fucking...ugh.\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Trish? Something...caught your eye?\u201d\r\n\u201cSomething\u2019s about to catch my horns if it doesn\u2019t stop.\u201d We share a small laugh and Trish stretches herself onto me. It had been a long day. Probably anyway, I don\u2019t actually know the time, but I don\u2019t feel like looking. We say our goodnights and exhaustion quickly overtakes us, sending us into a deep sleep together. "},"A Suprise Visit Chapter 3.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Chapter 3.txt"],"text":"A pair of arms wrap themselves around me and squeezes me close as the familiar noises of early-morning Trish fill my apartment once again. She opens her eyes and I feel her entire body spasm and tense, as if someone had just snuck up on her. \n\u201cOh fucking hell\u2026\u201d Trish partially relaxes then rolls onto her back. \u201cI actually slept with a fucking skinnie.\u201d \n\u201cPretty sure this isn\u2019t our first time.\u201d\n\u201cThat was napping, didn\u2019t count.\u201d\n\u201cSuuuuure it didn\u2019t.\u201d \n\u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d She reaches over to grab her phone, flicks it on and fiddles with it for a few moments, a scowl growing onto her face. She growls and I can see her about to prepare an angry response to what is almost certainly texts from her mom. \n\u201cHey,\u201d I put my hand on my shoulder and she looks at me, her expression softening ever so slightly. \u201cProbably for the best if you save it for later.\u201d She sighs and then tosses the phone to the side and moves to the bathroom, slamming the door behind her. Cranky morning for Trish, I guess. The shower creaks on and I wrestle myself out of bed to fix something to eat. \n\nSome minutes later Trish emerges from the bathroom and oh my sweet Raptor Jesus. \nHer signature yellow hoodie is hanging loosely from her hand, and what\u2019s beneath it is a baggy black tank top that just barely leaves enough to the imagination. And then she stretches, raising her arms out high and puffing her chest out. \n\u201cEyes off, skinnie,\u201d she says without even looking at me. Come on, I\u2019m not exactly being subtle here, but neither are you. \nI manage to peel my eyes away from that spectacle and back to my breakfast, grumbling some half-finished protest about \u2018my apartment\u2019 as she slips back into her hoodie. She sits down and picks up her phone again, and starts to text out some response.\n\u201cFeel better?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cStill kinda pissed, but at least now I probably won\u2019t say something I\u2019ll regret.\u201d Her phone elicits a flurry of ticking and tocking as she writes, and I leave her to it, sinking into my chair. The hell were we gonna do about her mom anyway? \u2018Never be in the same room as her\u2019 was technically a solution, but not one I wanted to deal with, especially if this was gonna last longer than a few months. Wait. Shit.\nI look over at the calendar, on the verge of flipping to September. Four months till January, and then I\u2019m on my own. \u201c...either college or the service. I don\u2019t care which,\u201d my dad had said. College is out of the question; I have no money, mediocre-at-best grades and most of the scholarship deadlines are almost certainly either gone or too close to matter. The military...there\u2019s no way they\u2019d let me in, right? Psychiatric evaluation would definitely filter me out, and if it somehow didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d operate too well around firearms. That leaves\u2026\n\u201cYou good over there? You\u2019re mumbling pretty hard.\u201d \n\u201cHuh, what? Oh, uh, yeah.\u201d Trish steps up to my chair and follows my eyes to the calendar.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d She asks. I explain the general situation and lack of options to her. \n\u201cSo yeah, I\u2019m pretty much fucked in four months unless I can figure something out. The thought of working minimum wage makes me want to tear my own spine out, and becoming homeless is...less than ideal.\u201d \n\u201cDamn, sounds like you got a lot to work through. And you gotta deal with me too.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only thing about all this that I can actually stand.\u201d \n\u201cAww, how sweet,\u201d Trish says sarcastically, although only somewhat.\n\u201cBarely.\u201d Without skipping a beat, Trish delivers a swift kick into my shin. I barely suppress a shout.\n\u201cSorry, what was that?\u201d\n\u201cYou..are wonderful,\u201d I manage to say without screaming, and Trish snickers, pleased with that outcome.  \u201cAnyways, I think I\u2019ll figure this shit out later, four months is plenty of time. Probably.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure your parents can\u2019t help you out? I mean, you went through a lot of shit.\u201d\n\u201cTrish, they didn\u2019t even visit me when I was in the hospital,\u201d I say as I rise to put my dishes away. Trish gasps, something I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard her do before.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d is all she can manage before pulling me into an embrace. \u201cAnon you gotta warn me before you drop shit like that.\u201d I apologize and return the hug.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I expected them to, I\u2019m used to it,\u201d I explain. \n\u201cHoly shit Anon! You gotta warn me before you drop shit like that. I thought I had it pretty rough.\u201d \n\u201cSorry, sorry. And hey, don\u2019t discount your own struggles just cause I got it bad, we both have shit to deal with. Speaking of, you cool things down with your mom?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah. She\u2019ll get over it, even if it takes her a while to fully appreciate the situation.\u201d\n\u201c...\u201d\n\u201c...\u201d\n\u201cSo, you gonna let go of me?\u201d\n\u201cNo, you made me sad. Fix it.\u201d Don\u2019t mind if I do.\nI place my hands on her cheeks and practically pull her lips into mine, giving her a long, hard smooch. Her hands latch onto my shoulders and somehow pull me in even closer. I break away for just a moment to catch a breath, but she pulls me back in hungirly. I tilt my head ever so slightly and flick my tongue across her lips, and she responds by craning her head and pulling me all the way in. Our tongues do not dance, they battle for dominance. One species against another, a duel as old as time, if a bit creative. Winner keeps their pride and gets bragging rights. It is not easy - her tongue handily dwarfs mine in size, and at times entirely wraps itself around mine in an analogous chokehold. The sensation is incredible and gives me some particularly interesting ideas for the future, but I\u2019ll worry about that later. \nTrish practically forces me away and I suddenly realize how out of breath I am. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong skinnie? Can\u2019t stay focused?\u201d She teases in between pants as I take a huge gulp of air. She doesn\u2019t wait for a response and pulls me into another unescapable makeout. I\u2019m caught off guard and she takes the opportunity to force her tongue into my mouth. The invasive muscle assumes direct control, and I can only weakly press against its underside with my own. My mind goes hazy, my knees weak and palms sweaty. I fall backwards into my chair and Trish leaps onto my lap, looking down at me. I can barely take another breath before locks me in again, and I\u2019m no longer in a state to resist. I give in completely, moaning in ecstasy as she displays her dominance, able to concentrate on nothing but the bliss I\u2019m experiencing. Nothing else matters. \nI don\u2019t know how long I sat there letting Trish have her way with my face, but she eventually peels away for long enough to let me catch my breath and snap back to reality. We stare into each other\u2019s eyes as we pant, until she finally breaks the quiet. \n\u201cMmmm. Now that. That was fun.\u201d I can only moan affirmatively in response, and Trish giggles. \u201dGood to know I have my own submissive little skinnie.\u201d \n\u201cHang on...I am not \u2018submissive\u2019.\u201d\nTrish leans towards me and opens her mouth, and I reflexively open mine, ready for another makeout session. Ready. Any second now.\nTrish pulls away with the biggest shit-eating grin I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\u201cReally now?\u201d Trish asks, the smugness in her tone so strong it poisons my very soul.\n\u201cHey...fuck you.\u201d Trish\u2019s response is to burst into laughter, almost falling off of me while banging on my table and crying. I make a mental note to absolutely get back at her for this one day.  \n\u201cAlright, alright, very funny. Now scooch off, I need to put this plate away and shower and all that.\u201d Trish collects herself and hops off of me, allowing me to get on with my daily hygiene routine. \n\nI emerge from the steamy cloak of the bathroom some time later, feeling confident and my pride refreshed. Trish was on my bed, eating...something, no doubt from my fridge, and browsing her phone.\n\u201cHey, come take a look at this.\u201d Trish waves me over and I take a seat next to her. \u201cNot that I\u2019m trying to damage your pride any further, but this may be a solution to your money issue.\u201d She hands me her phone, and it\u2019s displaying a page about unemployment and disability welfare benefits. \n\u201cOh come on Trish, that\u2019s just mean.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious! You think a shrink\u2019s gonna say \u2018no\u2019 to you? No offense of course, but still.\u201d I scanned through the page, taking note of the various requirements and caveats. \u201cBesides, you know how these government things tend to be. They\u2019ve got a lot of things to keep track of. Some of the finer details may end up getting blurry, you know?\u201d\n\u201cAre you familiar with this stuff?\u201d\n\u201cReed had gotten it into his head that it was a good idea a while back, we did a whole bunch of research into it together. Had to ditch it because it meant rehab for him once they found out about the carfe. And hey, you don\u2019t have to. Just saying it\u2019s probably better than tearing your own spine out working minimum wage.\u201d She\u2019s right about that. \n\u201cI\u2019ll look into it, I guess. Worst they can do is tell me to fuck off.\u201d I wrap my arm around Trish and pull her into me, and I take some time to appreciate the moment. Funny how quickly everything seems to have turned around, for both of us. I realize that I hadn\u2019t ever really had the opportunity to explore the unique features of a triceratop until now. I trace my fingers around the edges of the hood that jutted outwards from her head. The little horns that sprout from the top are a perfect white and quite sharp, same as her longer horns. The rough, rigid plate doesn\u2019t react to my prodding at all. Hmm.\n\u201cYes, I can feel that. And no, it\u2019s not a particularly interesting sensation. It\u2019s just bone.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe I\u2019ll have to try something else.\u201d\n\u201cIf you yank my tail, an accident is going to happen.\u201d I decide against suffering a fatal goring, saving the idea for later. Instead, I wrap my arms around Trish and nuzzle her cheek affectionately. \n\u201cHehe, what are you doing?\u201d Trish giggles.\n\u201cNothin\u2019. Just appreciating the company,\u201d I respond, pecking her on the cheek.\n\u201cGod you are such a sap. Come here.\u201d She shifts over to face me, and pulls our lips into an embrace once again. We trade a wide variety of kisses, pecks, nuzzles, giggles and sighs over the next few minutes, eventually settling into an incredibly relaxing cuddle. \n\u201cI might be a sap, but you\u2019re a total softy when you want to be.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if you bring that up, I\u2019ll stop wanting to be.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I think you enjoy it.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, you know what else I enjoy?\u201d Uh oh. In a flash, Trish is on top of me. She grabs my face and forces her tongue into my mouth, and only a muffled protest escapes from me. I desperately try to resist, wanting to avoid a second humiliation, but I can\u2019t match her skill and strength. Her tongue forces mine down as it makes itself at home, and I melt in her hands. I reflexively pull her body closer and push my face against hers, craving more and more of her. \nSensing my needs, Trish breaks off from me, the remnant of air remaining in my lungs used to ecstatically and unflatteringly moan. \n\u201cI enjoy showing my little skinnie his place.\u201d Is that weird? Probably. Even if it is hot. \n\n---\n"},"A Suprise Visit Chapter 4.5.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Chapter 4.5.txt"],"text":"!!!THIS IS A SHITPOST DO NOT  TAKE IT SERIOUSLY!!!\n\n\u201cREED!\u201d Trish\u2019s shriek hits me and I break into a full sprint.

You think I can\u2019t see what Anon really is? What all of this bullshit really is?\u201d Reed wildly gestures to nothing in particular. What in the sweet blue fuck? Reed\u2019s nonsensical spiel continues. \n\u201cI\u2019ve looked behind the curtain, Anon. And behind it I saw the source of it all. Every action you take, every word you speak, every thought you have, it\u2019s all just meaningless lines on a screen made by someone who doesn\u2019t even think we exist.\u201d\n\u201cTrish I think we might need to call an ambulance, I seriously think he\u2019s lost it.\u201d I\u2019ve heard Reed rattle off about nonsense before, but this is complete lunacy beyond anything I\u2019ve ever seen. \n\u201cYou only think it\u2019s \u2018lunacy\u2019 because you fail to see just how fragile all of this is.\u201d Reed once again gestures to nothing in particular. \n\u201cListen, Anon. Listen to your thoughts. Are they truly yours?\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, I\u2019m calling nine-one-one before he has a heart attack.\u201d\n\u201cIs your body even yours, Anon?\u201d\nWhat? My hand refuses to move. It\u2019s not your hand. Yes, it is. Watch.\nMy hand rises beside my head, then whips towards me and slaps me. \n\u201cAnon? What are you doing?\u201d Trish asks. Reed closes the distance to me.\nI...don\u2019t know.\n\u201cLook at me, Anon.\u201d I look at Reed, mere inches from me, his eyes full of malice and hatred. \n\u201cI\u2019m the main character now.\u201d\nAnon immediately recoils, falling backwards onto his ass. Trish rushes over to help him up, but his limbs are rigid. His eyes lock onto mine, unwavering, but full of fear, confusion and loss. He tries to speak, but only worthless syllables fall out of his mouth. \nA smile slowly creeps onto my face. A chuckle escapes my lips. A guffaw forces itself from my throat. \n\u201cSee how simple that was, Anon? See how quickly everything can change when someone actually knows what they\u2019re doing?\u201d \n\u201cWhat the fuck...what the fuck did you do to me?\u201d Poor Anon will never truly understand what he just lost.\n\u201cAnon?

We couldn\u2019t be. How could you be able to go back and prevent the massacre if the massacre predicated you going back to prevent it? It\u2019s a paradox, Anon. Cause and effect. We sit here on the precipice of salvation and yet we can do nothing but watch as it leaves us behind.\u201d Wrap it up.\nAnon can only gawk at this revelation, slowly realizing the futility of it all.\n\u201cReed...there has to be something. Anything. Right?\u201d Tears start to well in Anon\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Anon.

Some part of me had expected whatever was going on between Trish and I to accelerate, but that part had probably watched too many mediocre Chinese cartoons. We had gone on a couple of casual dates at fast food places in the meantime. I don't know what her obsession with that stuff is - she hasn't seemed particularly strapped for cash and doesn't even mind paying for me, taking into consideration my peculiar financial situation, but I can't complain. \nA now-familiar buzzing sound catches my ears and I check my phone to see a new message from Trish.\n\"hey\"\n\"Hey.\"\n\"wanna hang with reed in like an hour\"\n\"You sure?\"\n\"hes cool i promise\"\n\"Alright. Where at?\"\nAn address for a small public park appears on my screen. A little out of the way, but manageable, and not too far from Trish\u2019s house too. \n\"Am I meeting you there?\"\n\"ye\"\n\"Alright I'll be there.\"\n\nA little under an hour later I find myself surveying the park before me. A pair of massive trees dwarfed the area, casting a pleasant shade that shielded the ground below from the late-afternoon sun. The park was dotted with walkways, benches, tables, clusters of bushes and other various plant life. I spot Trish sitting at one of the tables and make my way over, seating myself next to her. \n\"Hey skinnie.\"\n\"Hey babe. Reed coming?\" \n\"Should be. Also if you call me any pet names around Reed terrible things will happen to you.\" I very briefly consider doing exactly that whenever Reed arrives, but decide against it for his sake. A few minutes of small talk later and a pink raptor with a tight fitting tank top shows up, sitting across from us.\n\"Yoo, Trish.\" Reed looks over at me, his expression remaining but his voice losing just a bit of enthusiasm. \"Anon.\" Without waiting for a response, he turns back to Trish. \"You finally calling in that favor, then?\"\n\"Favor? I- OH! No nononononono. It's not like that.\" Reed looks genuinely surprised for just a second before his expression melts back into his normal 'cool raptor' mode. \n\"Alright, cool. Wouldn't really wanna do that here anyway.\" I get the feeling that an Anon in another timeline is suddenly in grave danger.\n\"It's just, you know, it's been a while since we had a chance to hang out and chat,\" Trish explains.\n\"Yeah, I know sis. Been rough for all of us.\"\n\"Speaking of, I-\" An obnoxiously loud ringtone cuts Trish off, and she fishes into her pocket, pulling her phone out.\n\"Oh for fuck\u2019s...I'll be right back.\" Trish moves off to answer her call. The second she's out of earshot, Reed leans over and stares right into me, that cool stoner attitude completely absent. \n\"So, 'bro'. What's up with her?\" I'm taken completely off guard by Reed's shift, and can barely manage a confused grunt.\n\"Not once has she ever wanted you around for anything. And a few months ago she wanted you dead. Like, actually for real dead. Then I stop hearing from her completely, outside of the occasional 'I'm okay' when I try to talk to her. Out of nowhere she asks me to come here, and she brings you along, and she apparently no longer wants you dead. What gives?\" Reed's final question is laced with anger. The pit in my stomach grew with every word he spoke, and I come to realize that Reed is not nearly as 'cool' as Trish had promised. \n\"Look, we...we worked things out.\" My lack of readiness to have this conversation is obvious.\n\"Bullshit Anon, these aren't the kind of things you just 'work out'. Something fucky happened when I was out of the loop. She isn't telling me, so you will.\"\n\"It's her business, if she wants to tell you then-\" Reed slams on the table with his fist, and he struggles to contain the volume of his voice. \n\"Fuck off with that, I am not letting you just fuck off with one of my friends. Again.\" His last word drips with a demonic venom that completely floors me. The fuck can I even say to that? I can't just throw Trish's darkest moments around like they're my own, and he probably wouldn\u2019t even believe me if I told him. \nAs if by divine providence, Reed\u2019s expression morphs back into it\u2019s usual relaxed state, and Trish takes the seat next to me once again.\n\u201cSorry about that, got it handled though. So, how you been Reed?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m doing alright, all things considered.\u201d Was that a jab at me? \u201cHow\u2019ve you been? I was gettin\u2019 kinda worried when you weren\u2019t bein\u2019 super responsive, but I didn\u2019t wanna just show up unannounced, you know?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I was dealing with some...personal issues. A lot to think about. Too much, really. It took its toll, but I\u2019m starting to feel better.\u201d Reed is constantly glancing over at me while Trish talks. His face says nothing but his eyes say everything. Do I just lay everything out on the table and let the cards fall where they may, or excuse myself and let them talk it out in private? \n...\nFuck it. Reed\u2019s not a bad guy, and he\u2019s friends with Trish too. They can handle it. And if we have to end this early, it sure as hell isn\u2019t going to be my fault.\n\u201cHey, I think I\u2019m gonna go grab a drink. Either of you two want anything?\u201d \n\u201cJust a water, thank you,\u201d Trish responds. Reed\u2019s response is just to flash his signature thermos filled with only Raptor Jesus knows what. Taking my leave, I meander towards the vending machine. I struggle to slow my racing mind, desperate to know every word that they\u2019re exchanging. \nIt\u2019s not my business. I mentally repeat this a dozen times. I go through the motions to buy a bottle of water. It is not my business. Not. My. Business. I slowly bend over to retrieve the first bottle, then go through the motions a second time. It\u2019ll be fine. He can\u2019t possibly ruin everything in just a couple of minutes. \nRight? \nI turn towards the park table and slowly start to make my way back.\n\u201cREED!\u201d Trish\u2019s shriek hits me and I break into a full sprint.

I told you it was fine, why couldn\u2019t you just leave it?\u201d Trish places her head in her hands. \u201cDo you not trust me?\u201d Reed takes some time to survey the damage.

I move to follow her away. Reed starts shouting. \n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure as hell not letting you leave with that bastard!\u201d Trish stops. I can\u2019t see her face, but I can tell that pissed her off. She turns around and faces Reed. Her voice is low, full of hurt and anger.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you, Reed?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you, Trish? Monkey cock?\u201d\nBefore I can react, Trish goes completely berserk, screaming a terrible warcry and charging directly at Reed, horns forward. Reed dives to the side, being missed by mere inches. He scrambles to his feet and sprints into the distance, and Trish adjusts to chase him down.\n\u201cTrish!\u201d I shout as I run up to her. My voice causes her to stop in her tracks and I pull her into a hug. She lurches in Reed\u2019s direction but I hold her still. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t do something crazy!\u201d \n\u201cFucking bastard! Worthless stoner trash! Piece of shit! Let me go!\u201d \n\u201cTrish, please! This isn\u2019t worth it!\u201d She struggles against me for a few moments longer before slowing down.\n\u201cGod fucking damnit!

We\u2019re supposed to be\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd you still are, okay?\u201d I step in. \u201cReed just...doesn\u2019t understand. Yet.\u201d \n\u201cGod, what...what happened to him?\u201d  \n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but we should try to find out at some point,\u201d I say, desperately trying to salvage the situation before the damage is permanent. \u201cWe all got fucked up. He did too.\u201d That last line seems to get through, and Trish\u2019s eyes meet mine. \u201cWe\u2019ll work it out. Together.\u201d She silently wraps her arms around me and I pull her in tight. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nWe slowly make our way back into Trish\u2019s house and onto her couch. We lie down, her back against me as I cuddle her. She isn\u2019t crying, but I can tell how upset she is. \n\u201cI really didn\u2019t want to be sad today. Fuck. What do you think all that shit about \u2018resigning control\u2019 was, anyway?\u201d \n\u201cI dunno, Trish. Probably best not to dwell on it until we can actually talk to him again.\u201d \n\u201cAre we actually going to?\u201d \n\u201cWe can\u2019t just leave it like this. He\u2019s still Reed, you know?\u201d\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d I decide to drop the subject. Probably not the best time for it anyway. \n\nSoon after that conversation, I had to return home. Trish\u2019s mom was apparently not in the mood to see me and I wasn\u2019t about to push my luck. We said our goodbyes and traded hugs and kisses and then I was on my way back to Skin Row. I tried to relax when I got back to my apartment, but my mind roiled and toiled over what had happened. \nReed hates me. A lot. I can\u2019t exactly blame him, either. Would telling him what happened between Trish and I help? Would he even believe me? Should I even get involved, or can Trish handle it herself? Too many questions and no answers. I realize that I have absolutely no idea what Reed has been doing over the last few months. \n\u2018We all got fucked up. He did too.\u2019 My own words rattle around in my head. I\u2019m not even sure what I meant by that. I don\u2019t think I have ever seen Reed stressed before in the first place. How does Reed handle these things? Is it healthy? Probably not, considering the drug use. Fuck. Could be bad, but no idea how bad. And I won\u2019t know until I\u2019m able to talk to him again.\nI try my best to cast these unanswerable questions from my mind and drift off to a troubled sleep.\n"},"A Suprise Visit Chapter 5.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Chapter 5.txt"],"text":"5 - CARDS ON THE TABLE\n\nA few days come and go and I find myself once again on Trish\u2019s couch, with her wrapped around me, enjoying each other\u2019s company. Or at least, attempting to.

No response. \u201cTriiiish,\u201d I quietly call again, lightly rocking her. Nothing again. Desperate measures. \u201cTriiiiiiiiiiish,\u201d I repeat as I sneak my arm towards the base of her tail. Still quiet. Starting from the base, I slide my palm across the top of her tail and down towards the tip.

And everyone just wants to fuck it up.\u201d Discontent morphs to anger. \n\u201c\u2018Mama didn\u2019t raise no skinnie-sucker, Trish!\u2019 \u2018Why are you hanging out with a murderer, Trish?\u2019\u201d Her mocking tone fails to hide the building storm within her. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like being with you means they don\u2019t want to even care about me anymore.\u201d Trish shakes with barely constrained rage. \n\u201cWhy am I a lost cause to them now? Do they want me to go back to languishing in my fucking room all day? Do they want me to hold these stupid fucking grudges forever? God DAMNIT! I NEED them! But the fucking SECOND I do something they don\u2019t want, they threaten to throw me away like fucking trash!\u201d Trish collapses onto me, sobbing uncontrollably. \n\u201cI hate it so fucking much, Anon. I just want it to go back to normal. And now I have to decide between you, and them, and...\u201d Her tears drown out the end of her thought. I attempt to encourage her, but the lack of confidence in my voice is obvious.\n\u201cThey just...need time. We\u2019ve got time, it\u2019ll come around.\u201d\n\u201cUnless a miracle happens, you\u2019re going to be homeless at the end of the year.\u201d \n\u201cTrish, we-\u201d I\u2019m cut off by a buzzing in my pocket. My heart drops. I know exactly what this buzzing is for. Trish looks at me with wet eyes, and I pull out my phone to check the time. Ten minutes until Trish\u2019s mom normally returned, and I had to be out of the house to prevent an \u2018incident\u2019.\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d Trish screams, burying herself into me. Goddamnit all, this is the worst possible time. I can\u2019t stay, though. A parent-child shouting match\u2026\nA chill shoots across my spine and throughout my entire body.\nCan I really just leave her like this, though?\n\u201cYou wanna come with?\u201d I offer.\n\u201c...\u201d\n\u201c...\u201d\n\u201c...yeah.\u201d \nI dial the taxi service as we rush ourselves out the door. Within minutes the taxi driver appears and we\u2019re off on our way to Skin Row. Trish is still visibly upset and exhausted by what had just happened, and the driver stays uncharacteristically silent as we roar off towards my part of town. \n\nThe taxi blows past what would normally be \u2018end of the line\u2019 and comes to a screeching halt in front of my apartment building. \n\u201cI\u2019ll put it on your tab, go,\u201d the driver says, ushering us out of the taxi. Before we can even close the door behind us it screams down the road and out of sight. We hurry into the relative safety of my apartment as the sun dips below the horizon. Trish wastes no time flinging herself onto the bed and loudly groaning into it.\n\u201cWhy on earth did I agree to this. She\u2019s going to be so pissed.\u201d\n\u201cSomething tells me it\u2019d be worse if you stayed. And it wouldn\u2019t have been right for me to just leave after that.\u201d \n\u201cYeah...thanks.\u201d I take my place alongside Trish. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just...damnit. Why can\u2019t everyone just get along?\u201d Trish chuckles, albeit sadly. \u201cThat sounded kinda weird coming out of my mouth, but still\u2026we share something special. Something we don\u2019t share with anyone else. And everyone...everything seems like it\u2019s trying to take us apart.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019ll work through it, Trish. They just need time. I know I probably sound like a broken record at this point, but it pays to stay optimistic.\u201d I wrap my arms around Trish and pull her close, bringing our eyes to bear. \n\u201cI know, and I appreciate it...but\u2026\u201d Trish trails off, this particular thought not seeming easy to put into words. \n\u201cI know I said that I needed them earlier, but...do I? If they\u2019re just going to hurt me, why bother keeping them around?\u201d\n\u201cNot a good idea to burn those kinds of bridges. You said it yourself - barring a miracle, I\u2019m gonna be in trouble real soon. We\u2019ll need something to fall back on.\u201d\n\u201cWe could be homeless together.\u201d I raise an eyebrow.\n\u201cI...can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re joking or not.\u201d Trish just shrugs. \n\u201cOf course you could always get a job, you know.\u201d I grumble, but the idea seems...slightly more palatable than it was a couple of weeks ago.\n\u201cI mean, your dad is paying for the rest of the year, right? A few months to save up some money might go a long way.\u201d Hmm. She\u2019s right, but\u2026\n\u201cYou got anything better to do?\u201d \n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d I admit. \n\u201cCome on, how bad could it be?\u201d I try to formulate a protest, but Trish pleads with me. \u201cDo it for me?\u201d I\u2019m completely enraptured by her eyes, and her tone makes my voice catch in my throat. It takes me a few moments to finally break the spell, and I shake my head in an attempt to clear the daze.\n\u201cAgh, you fucking...fine.\u201d Trish cheers and hugs me tight, then starts pecking at my face with her lips. Her assault is relentless, lips planting on random parts of my face, tiny smooch noises punctuating each attack. \n\u201cHey!\u201d Peck. \u201cNo!\u201d Peck. \u201cQuit that!\u201d Peck. \u201cStop!\u201d Peck. \u201cAAAAA!\u201d Peck. Trish cackles and snorts as I fail to evade her. I go to counterattack, holding her face still and all but ramming my lips into hers. \n\u201cMmph!\u201d Gotcha, you twitchy little hooligan. She relaxes in my arms as we kiss, and we pull apart a few seconds later with a satisfying pop. We cuddle for a while longer, then Trish\u2019s phone goes off. The ringtone is different from last time.\n\u201cHmm? Oh, it\u2019s...Reed.\u201d Worry paints her face as the merry tone jingles in her hand.\n\u201cYou should take that. See if he\u2019s willing to come around.\u201d Trish hesitantly nods and then steps away to the bathroom to answer the call. \n\nShe returns a few minutes later looking...uncertain. \n\u201cEverything go well?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cMaybe?\u201d \n\u201cIs it a start?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cAh, wonderful. I guess it could be worse.\u201d Trish snuggles up alongside me and we eventually drift off to sleep together. \n"},"A Suprise Visit Chapter 6.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Chapter 6.txt"],"text":"6 - HEAT OF THE SEPTEMBER SUN\n\nThe first thing I notice when I wake the next morning is that I\u2019m covered in sweat. The next thing I notice is that I\u2019m resting in a veritable pool of sweat. I slowly raise from my bed, careful not to wake Trish, and walk over to the thermostat. It\u2019s set to a reasonable temperature, so why the fuck was it so hot? \nI slip on some shoes, go outside and run down to the lobby of the apartment complex. It\u2019s no cooler in there than it is in my apartment, and I walk up to the bored looking receptionist. Before I even open my mouth, she speaks.\n\u201cBuilding\u2019s A\/C is fuckered, be fixed whenever.\u201d Right, of course. I thank her and make my way back to my apartment. I hear Trish groaning and stretching, and then shouting.\n\u201cHoly fuck why is it so fucking hot. What the fuck?\u201d I repeat what the receptionist said to me. \n\u201cGod damnit. Fuck.\u201d She gets up and walks over to the window, throwing it open. She stands in the sunlight for a few moments.\n\u201cThis did not help in the fucking slightest. Fuck.\u201d I quickly check the weather on my phone. It\u2019s currently the hottest day of the week, clear skies, and no wind. This was gonna be a long day. I relay the information to Trish.\n\u201cFffffuuuuuuuuuuuck,\u201d she groans, stepping into the bathroom and slamming the door behind her, the shower creaking on soon afterwards. I remove my jacket and toss it to the side. I\u2019m usually apprehensive about revealing my skeleton arms around others, but I don\u2019t think Trish will care outside of some mild teasing, and it\u2019s worth it to alleviate some of the heat. I also swap out of my sweat-drenched clothes and into fresher ones, then sink into my desk chair. After a few moments I realize the sun is bearing directly onto me and my seat, so I close the window and shut the blinds, the room darkening significantly. Much better. \nSome minutes later Trish emerges from the bathroom and oh my sweet Raptor Jesus. \nHer signature yellow hoodie is hanging loosely from her hand, and what\u2019s beneath it is a baggy black tank top that just barely leaves enough to the imagination. And then she stretches, raising her arms out high and puffing her chest out. \n\u201cYep, still hot as shit,\u201d she grumbles.\n\u201cI know. Weather\u2019s pretty brutal too.\u201d Trish looks at me this time, her face a blur of emotions. At first confused, then fucking pissed, then aroused, then back to fucking pissed, all in the space of an attosecond. She throws her hoodie at my face in response, mumbling some swear under her breath. I chuckle and move to the bathroom to commence my own morning routine. \nI throw open the door to the bathroom after I finish, stretching vividly and puffing my chest out.\n\u201cYep, still hot as shit,\u201d I say, out loud. Trish is leaning against the wall perpendicular to the bed, on her phone and still in her tank top. She doesn\u2019t look up or bother responding at all. Bitch. \nI lean back against the bed\u2019s pillow and navigate to an Tunisian boat maintenance forum on my phone, ready to start my day with some easy internet baiting. Before I can find a suitable target, the phone is practically knocked out of my hands and my shoulder is pushed into the wall. \nThe first thing I see is what\u2019s directly down Trish\u2019s tank top, which happens to be her heaving, sweat-glistened, purple breasts. Her top is just baggy enough to let them hang freely, and just tight enough to hide whatever else might be in there. Above that is Trish\u2019s arm, currently pressing my shoulder into the wall, and above that is her face, a wicked, malicious smirk painted on it. \n\u201cYou say something, skinnie?\u201d I grin incredibly nervously.\n\u201cUhhhh, I said \u2018yep, still hot as shit\u2019.\u201d  \n\u201cAnd after that?\u201d Shit shit shit shit shit.\n\u201cN-nothing?\u201d She leans in as close as she can, her mouth an inch from mine.\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d She whispers. I lean forward to kiss her, but she backs away as if she expected it, and slaps me in the face. \n\u201cAh, you bitch!\u201d FUCK! Why did I say that!?\nShe holds my head in place and lurches forward, stuffing her tongue into my mouth and sitting down right on my stomach. I don\u2019t even bother fighting back, closing my eyes and lazily hanging my arms on her shoulders to pull her in closer. The muscle flicks around inside of my mouth like a hunting predator as I rub against its underside with my own, reflexively suckling on the invader. She pulls away with a \u2018mpwah\u2019, a string of spittle connecting us for a moment before falling into my lap. \n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought you said,\u201d she laughs triumphantly. I can only give a weak \u2018hah\u2019 in response as I stare into her eyes. My mind is clouded by two different kinds of heat, which, at this rate, is going to be an ongoing issue for some time. \nTrish grabs the bottom of her tank top and pulls it off, her breasts flopping out and giving an extremely mesmerizing bounce as their full glory is revealed. She flicks the article to the side and tentatively squeezes her boobs together, bringing full attention to the dark purple nipples adorning them. I can only sit back and marvel at their beauty, light shimmering off of her purple scales. I can feel my heart hammering, as well as another organ pulsating against Trish\u2019s thighs. I swear I can see rainbows refracting from her.\n\u201cYou just gonna sit there, you fucking idiot?\u201d Her impatient voice snaps me out of my enamored trance, and in a moment of pure clarity, I say the most important sentence that\u2019s ever come out of my mouth in my entire life.\n\u201cYou have some fat fucking titties, Trish.\u201d \n\u201cYou are fucking hopeless.\u201d She reaches over and latches onto my head, pulling me forward and into her heaving chest. My head presses into those heavenly pillows of life and I wrap my arms around her back, pulling me in further. I nuzzle her sternum as her warm breasts cradle my head, panting like a dog.\n\u201cDo something! Fuck!\u201d I feel a smack on the back of my head, and I\u2019m pulled out of my daze, making a very important realization: my face is in Trish\u2019s fat fucking titties. I sit all the way up and plant a kiss on Trish\u2019s neck, taking one of her breasts in my hand and lightly cradling it. I kiss her collarbone and gently squeeze, then work my way down to her other breast, kissing the top and moving around the side, eventually facing her nipple directly. I put my mouth on it and suck while pressing my thumb against the other one and squeezing. \n\u201cFinally\u2026\u201d Trish moans softly. I eventually swap breasts and continue my work, getting closer to figuring out exactly what she likes with every shiver and shudder. \n\u201cHaah...at least you learn fast\u2026\u201d Sensing an opening, I quickly push against her, shoving her into the bed and I clamber over her, panting heavily, then lean down to kiss her. She lets me take the reins this time, and I take the opportunity to lovingly tongue-dance with her. A hand makes its way down my chest and to my crotch, my blue jeans completely unable to hide the outline of my diamond dong. I respond in kind, my hand making my way down her thigh and to the crease in her black track pants. Trish starts to rub me through my jeans, and I rub her back, her pants offering little resistance to my prodding.\nI fall down onto my side and pull Trish close with my free arm, continuing to kiss her as our stroking increases. She hungirly rattles the button to my pants and undoes it, shoving her hand into my pants and wrapping it around my cock. I slip my hand into her pants, pressing my fingers against her wet pussy. She starts to yank my member, and I apply some pressure to her opening. She makes an audible \u2018mmph!\u2019 as a finger slips in and starts stroking faster. She brings her free hand around and tears my pants off, my throbbing cock finally free of it\u2019s denim prison as my finger explores her. She breaks our kiss, breathing heavily as the twin-heat assault rages in and out of her. I move back above her, pulling off her pants and fully revealing her dinosaur slit, the slightest bit of rose peeking through her purple scales. I practically fling myself against her, my cock ready to plunge the depths as I maneuver it towards her.\n\u201cW-wait! C...condoms...\u201d she manages between heavy breaths. I lumber over to the dresser and start yanking open drawers. No, no, no, come on, they\u2019re here somewhere, no, there! I pull the box out and throw the whole thing at Trish. She tries to catch it but it just bounces off her outstretched hand and falls to the floor.\n\u201cUh...h-how many\u2026?\n\u201cAll of them,\u201d I grunt as I clamber back on top of her, my cock twitching with anticipation and glistening with sweat and precum. She fiddles with the box and pulls out the entire strip of twenty-four Ragnum condoms. She shakily pulls one off and tears it open, pressing it against my dick. I unroll it the rest of the way and collapse back onto her, shifting and gyrating my hips into position. I press my tip against her entrance and take a good look at her face, full of arousal, anticipation and preparedness. Why, I could probably stare at it forever\u2026\n\u201c...Anon?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u201d\n\u201cAre you gonna\u2026?\n\u201cGonna what?\n\u201cGonna\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific, Trish. What is it you want?\u201d She tries to growl, but I lightly thrust against her and it comes out as a moan. She bites her lip.\n\u201cFuck me like the raptor-damned monkey you are!\u201d Say no more.\nI plunge my cock straight into her, watching as her eyes roll into her head and her tongue flops out, letting out a guttural moan of pure lust and pleasure. I waste no time getting to work, the apartment very quickly filling with moans, grunts and the slaps of flesh against scale as I take this once-bitchy triceratops straight to pound-town.\nHer arms and legs all wrap around me simultaneously, begging me to go deeper and deeper as she incoherently moans into my ear. I wholeheartedly oblige, my full length finding refuge inside of Trish as I continue to hammer away at her, every thrust sending a jolt of pleasure through our bodies. Her shape, her tightness, and her wetness all work together to create the perfect home for my cock, which I am currently completely and utterly destroying. \n\u201cAnon\u2026!\u201d She loudly moans my name as she squeezes me even harder, our explosive finish just ahead.\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d Trish screams in pure ecstasy and her entire body tenses, inside and out. The sudden pressure from every direction pushes me over the edge, and I roughly commit my final slam into her as wave after wave of orgasmic pleasure washes over us.\nWe collapse into a moaning, shuddering pile together. We bask in the afterglow, our hot, sweaty bodies pressed against each other as we gaze into each other\u2019s eyes, our heartbeats and breathing synchronized. \nTrish eventually breaks the relative silence with giggles. It\u2019s contagious and I giggle with her, unsure why. \n\u201cHehehe, what....what\u2019s so funny?\u201d\n\u201cMom\u2019s gonna be piiiiiiiissed.\u201d She busts out laughing.\n\u201cHehe...if you think that\u2019ll piss her off, wait till you see what I do to you in ten minutes.\u201d \n\u201cYou sure you can handle that? You look like you\u2019re gonna pass out.\u201d \n\u201cI...uh\u2026\u201d Holy FUCK it is hot in here. Trish snickers at my exhaustion. \u201cMaybe...maybe fifteen minutes. Ugh\u2026\u201d I fall onto my back, panting. \n\u201cI\u2019ve got a pretty good idea,\u201d Trish says, glancing over towards the bathroom. She looks back to me, and I obnoxiously waggle my eyebrows in response. She picks up the nearest things she can and throws it at me, which happens to be the condom strip.\n\u201cHey, only twenty-three to go!\u201d \n\u201cYou wish.\u201d She slowly stands up, and I take the opportunity to drink her fully naked body in. She was magnificently lithe, her hips and ass having the perfect amount of meat and curve. She starts off towards the bathroom, her hips and tail swishing mesmerizingly with every step. You really struck out, huh Anon?\nI follow her into the bathroom as the shower creaks on, a spray of water falling from the spout. She smirks at me as she silently steps into the stream, although I can see her body tense from the temperature. I step in after her and\u2026\n\u201cFfffffffffff....ooh fuck that\u2019s cold.\u201d Trish cackles in reply. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s refreshing.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have a solution.\u201d I press Trish into the wall and plant my lips on hers, pressing our bodies together. Ah, sweet warmth. I suckle on her neck and start working my way down the rest of her body, tasting the sweat and lukewarm water clinging to her. I squeeze her breasts as I pass them, continuing down her midriff and between her legs. I lovingly kiss and caress her thighs as she moans, and plant one final kiss just above her pussy. I dive in with my tongue, greedily lapping at her and causing her to yelp in surprise. \n\u201cAh\u2026! Anon...shit...!\u201d I press my face against her nethers, shoving my tongue inside her like she did to me all those times. She writhes against me, loudly moaning as I explore her velvety interior. \nI break off and stand back up, pulling Trish into another kiss, and we share her taste. I look down at my almost painfully throbbing erection, and back up at Trish, the same lust in her eyes as earlier. She turns around and braces herself against the wall, spreading her legs and waving her tail back and forth, looking back at me wantingly. I grab another condom, tear the packaging off and wrap it around my dick. \nI don\u2019t bother with the games this time, and instead grab her tail and use it as support to pull myself straight into her. \n\u201cFuck! Haah\u2026\u201d Her cute moans only arouse me further as I reach around, grabbing her tits and slamming all the way into her. \n\u201cFUCK!\u201d Damn she\u2019s loud. She doesn\u2019t get any quieter as I jackhammer her against the shower wall. The warmth from her body and the cold from the water as well as my still-sensitive dick amplify the entire experience as Trish and I synchronize our thrusts together. We somehow keep our near-perfect rhythm as our pleasure and tempo increases, the slapping and moaning overpowering the noise of the shower almost entirely. Our rhythm crescendos with our pleasure, Trish screams, and we\u2019re blasted with powerful waves of ecstasy as we orgasm again. \nSoon enough we\u2019re left with just the sounds of the shower and our breathing. \nWe wordlessly clean ourselves up and dry off, then lie back down on the bed and embrace each other. \n\u201cHoly shit, Anon. That was...incredible.\u201d\n\u201cA compliment from you? That\u2019s incredible.\u201d \n\u201cThis room\u2019s about to be incredibly red if you don\u2019t shut up.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve still got twenty-two more of those, you know? It would be a shame to waste them.\u201d Trish starts to protest, but all that comes out is some affirmative mumble. Guess I win that one. \n"},"A Suprise Visit Chapter 7.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Chapter 7.txt"],"text":"7 - TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION \n\n\"Ow! Fuck!\" I'm startled from my sleep and into Trish swearing loudly, her face contorted in pain. \n\"You good?\" I drearily ask.\n\"Sore. Everything's fucking sore. Holy fuck. Ow.\" I try stretching a limb and immediately realize just how sore I am as well, a jolt of pain shooting through me. \nYesterday was incredibly exhausting. We hadn't noticed the A\/C click back on during the day, and we hadn't even noticed the sun going down that night. I lost count of how many times we had gone at it, trying a number of different positions and other interesting ideas throughout, only briefly stopping for food and drinks when we were on the verge of passing out completely. \n\"It was kinda worth it, though.\" Trish continues to groan and swear, not acknowledging my response. \nThe soreness eventually subsides to the point where we can get out of bed and get on with the day; showering, eating, and getting dressed. And laundry - definitely laundry. Trish\u2019s phone goes off at some point and she answers it. It\u2019s a fairly one-sided conversation, with Trish only offering the occasional \u2018yup\u2019 and \u2018mmhmm\u2019 as the other voice - almost certainly her mom - rants and raves about something I can\u2019t understand from my position. Trish eventually answers a question with more than just an affirmative, an absolutely dastardly grin on her face.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m with him right now...yup...mmhmm...yeah, I spent all day yesterday getting my horns fucked off.\u201d Oh. That\u2019s what that conversation is about. Figures, honestly. The voice on the other end doubles in volume, although it\u2019s no more understandable to me, and Trish looks like she\u2019s about to explode into laughter. \nShe manages to barely keep her composure throughout the rest of the call, and when it ends she promptly busts a gut, howling with manic laughter. I get the sinking feeling that she\u2019s just burnt a bridge she shouldn\u2019t have as her cackling continues. \nHer laughter eventually falls to a giggle as she catches her breath, and she looks at me with an incredibly goofy smile. \n\u201cThat felt good,\u201d she says briefly. \n\u201cAre you sure that was a good idea?\u201d \n\u201cPfft, whatever. I\u2019m done with these fucking twiddlydick games, holding fuckin\u2019 Swords of Dinocles over my goddamn head all the time. Either fuck off or let it drop, not worth the stress of shitting myself over it. Besides, I\u2019d rather know where she stands now rather than a month or two.\u201d That\u2019s....reasonable. I think. \n\u201cStill, couldn\u2019t you have...sugar-coated it a bit?\u201d \n\u201cNah, this way she gets it all out of her system. Might have to avoid the area for a bit though. Which means you're stuck with me for a while longer.\u201d \n\u201cRight, pizza it is then.\u201d \n\nTrish and I return to the apartment later in the afternoon, hands full of groceries, essentials, and two freshly baked pizzas. We get everything put away, and I move to open one of the pizza boxes, but Trish\u2019s voice stops me.\n\u201cHey, Anon...you wanna like, invite Reed?\u201d I reflexively scowl at the memory of our last encounter. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll be a bit more sympathetic, considering the situation,\u201d Trish attempts to assure me. I roll the idea around for a bit. What could go wrong? A lot. \nWhat could go right? Enough. \n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d I sigh. \nLooks like today\u2019s gonna be out of the frying pan and into the fire. Trish pulls out her phone and dials Reed. Part of me hopes that he just says \u2018no\u2019 so I can continue putting this off, but that hope is quickly dashed when I hear Trish offering over my address, hanging up soon after. \n\u201cHey, it\u2019ll go better this time, okay?\u201d Trish says. Is my nervousness that obvious? \n\u201cYou know we can\u2019t keep him in the dark about all this stuff forever, right?\u201d I reply. Trish only nods in response, and I can tell she\u2019s dreading what\u2019s to come as much as I am. It needs to be done though, if only to find out where he stands. \nReed shows up surprisingly quickly. Was he in the area, or did he live close by? The second wouldn\u2019t actually be all that surprising. We sit on the floor and eat in relative quiet for some time, errant bits of smalltalk failing to start any meaningful conversations. The mood is solemn, the air is tense, and all ears are on Reed to finally shatter the tentative peace of our meal. \nSoon enough, he does, launching straight into the hardest questions that can only be answered with the most painful memories. Trish and I agree that, for all of our sakes, Reed deserves to know everything. He needs to. The next few hours are unequivocally brutal. Question after question and answer after answer eventually turned a grueling interrogation into a heartfelt confession circle. By the end of it Trish and I had cried our weights in tears, and even Reed couldn\u2019t hold it back the entire time, although whether it was true sympathy or simply emotional contagion remained to be seen.\nReed goes quiet and looks at the floor, his face going through a number of conflicting emotions. He silently struggles to find the words he\u2019s looking for, unearthing memories and truths that have yet to be spoken. \n\u201cTrish...I\u2019m sorry for what I said a few days ago. I couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined...any of this. I just...I saw Anon with you and was terrified of seeing it all happen again. I freaked out and told myself I couldn\u2019t let it happen again. That I had to take control of things for once, rather than watching things happen. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling myself for months. That I couldn\u2019t just keep sitting by as a...a fucking spectator. Someone without any control, just watching from the sidelines as my friends live out their lives. I needed to do something. Anything. I said the first thing that came to my mind that I thought would snap you out of whatever I figured you had gotten into. I had thrown away the first chance I was given in months within minutes.\u201d Reed shudders, out of breath and emotionally drained. \n\u201cAnd Anon...I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to completely move past everything that happened. But it was stupid of me to think that it didn\u2019t change you. Like it changed all of us. Trish trusted you, and I should\u2019ve trusted her. I don\u2019t see her for months, and the first thing I do is lose control of myself. Again.\u201d\nHis frown turns to a scowl as he collects his thoughts again.\n\u201cA few days after the funeral, I overdosed. Bad. I don\u2019t know how long I was out or how long I was in the hospital. I sat in that damn bed for who knows how long, just wasting. Waiting to be back in control. I kept telling myself that I\u2019d never lose control like that again. That I wouldn\u2019t be known as \u2018the stoner friend\u2019 who just sits around, off his ass on whatever the fuck all day. That I\u2019d actually get myself involved rather than waiting for others to involve me. But that\u2019s just not how it works.\u201d Reed sighs and hangs his head in shame. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone about it. After all, who would trust a guy who can\u2019t even control his own damn intake?\u201d He falls silent, allowing his words to fully soak in. \n\u201cDamnit, Reed!\u201d Reed flinches as Trish lunges across our circle and towards Reed, practically tackling him - thankfully with much less murderous intent than last time - knocking the wind out and wrapping him in a hug many months overdue. \n\u201cOof...apology accepted, I guess?\u201d \n\u201cYes, you...fucking jackass\u2026\u201d Trish tries to play up her anger but the last few hours have taken their toll on her. On all of us. They right themselves after a moment and Trish grumbles.\n\u201cWhy were we so...stupid?\u201d  A pretty good question, honestly. I wait for a follow up, but one never comes, Trish only expectantly looking at us for an answer. I decide to speak up.\n\u201cWell, if we all thought it was our own faults, why would we expect anyone to want to help us? We were just getting what we deserved.\u201d They both nod, seeming to agree with this sentiment. \n\nEvening starts to roll in soon after the tail end of our conversation.\n\u201cAlright dudes, I think I\u2019m gonna head out. I\u2019ve...got a lot to think about now. But at least I\u2019ve got friends again, right?\u201d The two of us smile and nod. Things will never be the same again, but at least we still have each other. \n\u201cWait, Reed,\u201d Trish stops him. \u201cI...might have...kind of pissed off my mom. Like, a lot. Any chance we could maybe crash at your place at some point?\u201d\n\u201cHmm. Yeah, I know a couple places you could hang out at if you need to take the heat off. But, uh...are you two like...a thing?\u201d Reed glances between Trish and I. \n\u201cNah,\u201d Trish replies quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re just hanging out and my mom hates that.\u201d \n\u201cAh, shoot, my bad. Don\u2019t want to imply anything weird, I\u2019ll just get going.\u201d\n\u201cReed, don\u2019t believe her lies. Her mom is pissed off specifically because of how much of a thing we are,\u201d I interject.  \n\u201cAnon doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Trish rebuts.\n\u201cShould I repeat what you told your mom on the phone earlier?\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Trish dares, her signature smugness reignited. I hesitate. Reed doesn\u2019t really need to hear it, but to back down now would be admitting defeat, and I couldn\u2019t let that happen more than it already had. I clear my throat.\n\u201cI believe the phrasing you used was \u2018getting your horns fucked off\u2019, right?\u201d Trish\u2019s mouth stays curved into that smirk, but her eyes widen in surprise. \n\u201cAlright! I think I\u2019ve officially overstayed my welcome, I\u2019ll be going now, you two have a good night, good luck with the mom situation, bye!\u201d We wave and yell goodbyes while Reed rushes himself out the door, closing it behind him. \n\u201cYou are such a jackass, Anon.\u201d \n\u201cYou literally asked for it. I don\u2019t want to hear any complaints, especially considering the amount of shit you would\u2019ve given me for backing down.\u201d \n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll give you even more shit for not backing down.\u201d\n\u201cImpossible, it won\u2019t be justified if you do, and I\u2019ll be able to give that shit back.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, whatever. I\u2019ve got other ways to make you back down, anyway.\u201d An almost sadistic grin forms on her face.\nUh oh.\n"},"A Suprise Visit Chapter 8.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Chapter 8.txt"],"text":"8 - FACE THE MUSIC\n\nThe temperature dropped as September rolled into October and eventually into November. Things had continued between Trish and I well enough, albeit sporadically. She assures me that her mom has calmed down over the entire situation, but the fact that I haven\u2019t stepped foot in her house since then wasn\u2019t exactly a vote of confidence. \nReed warmed up to us fairly quickly after that second meeting. There were still some times where he seemed distant, but he promised it was because of him quitting carfe cold turkey, at least in part. He still had some...interesting...ideas about spots to relax at. I still have no idea why we agreed to meet up at an abandoned factory, or why we stayed for as long as we did. \nA response from the government had come in at some point, expressing their \u2018interest in helping\u2019, while outlining a laundry list of requirements and detailing a long and arduous process about how to confirm eligibility. The legalese and in-depth bureaucrat-speak made my eyes glaze over, but what I did glean was that it would take months to actually get everything squared away, and I didn\u2019t exactly have months to spend on a chance of something going right. \nThat only left one half-way decent idea, which was to get a job. Almost certainly minimum wage, or close enough to it. Desires of spontaneous and violent laminectomy aside, it was the only real way to secure a relative amount of independence and cash flow while I worked to unfuck my increasingly desperate financial situation. At the very least, I had convinced Trish to join me in the job hunting. It wasn\u2019t exactly ideal, but it would help more than it hurt. \nI had applied to a large swathe of businesses, straying from food service and call centers except for a last resort, and ended up accepting a job at some sort of thrift-slash-curio-slash-pawn shop called \u2018Red Sun, Blue Moon\u2019. It was run by an aging male triceratops who could flip between cool and charming to argumentative and stubborn as all hell at a moments notice, and he seemed to thoroughly enjoy employing both attitudes towards prospective buyers and sellers alike. \nThe store itself was cramped, with barely enough space for two people (or one tyrannosaurus) in each walkway. Most of the floor and wall space reserved for shelves and stands that sat filled with all sorts of random items: Jewelry; old toys; book; low-end tech; hobbyist supplies; crap that looked like it came from a gift shop on another continent; some things that were just plain offensive, and some that looked like they might have been illegal. Not that I bothered to ask questions anymore. Asking the owner - Mr. B - things as simple as what the \u2018B\u2019 stood for, or what the name of the store meant, were only answered with a chuckle and nothing more. \n\nMost days in the shop were slow, as was this one. A slow trickle of various dinos and occasional humans came through, sometimes even buying something, although most were here to sell whatever random stuff they could come up with. Mr. B handled these requests with ease, a veritable master of salesdinoship - at least from what I could tell - while I handled the register for the odd customer looking to buy. \nThe bell above the front door dings as someone walks into the store. I lean forward and sit up in the little chair behind the cash register, knowing full well who had just arrived. Trish became an assistant for a hairdresser place not too far from mine, and we would occasionally visit each other during breaks and walk together after our shifts ended. \n\u201cHey Anon. Hope you aren\u2019t busy,\u201d Trish says, putting her arms on the counter and smirking. I take a quick look around the shop. Completely empty, outside of Mr. B and some middle-aged pteranodon discussing the quality of the wood finish on some random knick-knack. \n\u201cPretty fast today. Might only get a couple minutes.\u201d \n\u201cOh well, I guess we\u2019ll have to make them count.\u201d I walk out from around the counter and take Trish\u2019s hand, walking down one of the aisles and glancing at all the random items neatly placed along the shelves. Trish flicks a bobblehead that dances the line between cute and grotesque. \n\u201cI swear most of this stuff wasn\u2019t here last time I visited,\u201d Trish comments. \n\u201cIt was only a couple days ago. Mr. B might be weird but I don\u2019t think he can pull an entire shop\u2019s worth of stock out of nowhere.\u201d \n\u201cI dunno...like, what the hell is this? Surely I would remember seeing something like this.\u201d She picks up a small watercolor painting of what appears to be two human men wrestling. Naked.\n\u201cAlright, alright. I really don\u2019t need to see that. There\u2019s probably weirder shit in here anyway.\u201d\n\u201cAh, well now I have to buy this,\u201d Trish giggles at my groan, only slightly exaggerated. \n\u201cAtta\u2019 boy, Mous! Make some sales!\u201d Mr. B raises his voice at us before turning back to his bartering opponent. \nWe continue down the aisle, gawking at all the assorted gibberish taken physical form. Trish kind of had a point; a lot of this stuff I have never seen before. Then again, it could just be confirmation bias. \nWe round a corner and Trish gasps, something apparently catching her eye, and she rushes over to get a closer look. Something different catches my eye, on the opposite corner of the shop. Trish\u2019s words fade away into the background as all my focus centers on an unassuming instrument in front of me. A lightly worn, light-brown wood, six-string guitar silently rests on a simple black stand in the corner. \nMy heart and mind fall prey to fear and anxiety, but something within me perseveres. My legs move me forward. My fingers calmly trace the taut strings from the neck and down the body. A tentative strum shows that the strings are tuned well enough. My heart and mind are a complete frenzy of emotions and thoughts as the strings return to their rest. They beg me to let go, to move on, to leave and never look back. Their cries are ignored as I take the guitar into my hands and sit cross-legged. \nA thousand moments and memories flash in the background of my mind, but only one is strong enough to stand out. It\u2019s the only one I need. It\u2019s what guides my hands to those familiar positions. It\u2019s what guides my fingers to press those familiar strings, and to make that familiar strumming motion. It\u2019s what recognizes that familiar sound. It\u2019s what takes me from one chord to the next. It\u2019s what turns that familiar sound into a familiar tune. It\u2019s what wets my face as it continues. \nI miss a note, and it falters. In an instant, the moment is shattered, and I\u2019m painfully aware of everything. My racing heart, my unsteady breath, my blurry eyes, the deafening silence, and the eyes on me. I lurch over, hiding my face behind the guitar and blocking the world out. A gasp and a shudder preclude a quiet sob. Quiet sobs preclude louder ones. Within moments I\u2019m bawling into my lap. I had it. And now it\u2019s gone. \nA hand rests on my back, fingers soothingly tracing across me. \nYou are not alone. \nI glance over and see Trish, gripped with concern but offering a smile of comfort. I turn back inwards, but my lips curve upward. \n\u201cWhat was that, Anon?\u201d Trish whispers. I sigh in relief and pain, gain and loss, and so much more.\n\u201cFang\u2019s song.\u201d \nI\u2019m not sure how long we sit in silence. My breath steadies and my heart slows. I eventually manage to pull my head out from behind the guitar, returning to reality. I slowly stand up and look at the guitar in my hand. Inspiration. Motivation. Progress. \nI walk over to Mr. B at the checkout desk, and gently place the guitar on it. He rings up the total, and I reach for my wallet, not even bothering to check the display.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2018bout it, Mous. We\u2019ll do a...a weekly thing, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\u201cYeah...thanks, Mr. B.\u201d\n\u201cThink I\u2019ll close up early, too. Doubt anyone will notice.\u201d \n\u201cThanks, Mr. B.\u201d \n\u201cAlso I\u2019ll throw in that\u2026\u2019painting\u2019 your girlfriend wanted.\u201d\n\u201cNo thanks, Mr. B.\u201d\n\u201cToo late, already sold.\u201d I hear a \u2018Yes!\u2019 from Trish behind me, and I can\u2019t help but chuckle. \n\u201cSee ya, Mous. Have a good weekend. Don\u2019t forget the stand, that\u2019s part of the package.\u201d \n\u201cThanks, Mr. B. You too.\u201d \nTrish follows me out the front door, guitar stand and painting in hand.\nNo longer did I hear the cries of anxiety and the pleadings of fear from a time past. I feel my mind, body and soul unite, dedicated towards a single purpose. A purpose I now held in my very hands. \n\n-- End --\n"},"A Suprise Visit Gangster Edition.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Suprise Visit Gangster Edition.txt"],"text":"Title: A Suprise Visit Gangster Edition\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Trish and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-Off\nAuthor: Lowkeyloki\n\n\n\"How?\"\n\"How could this have happened?\"\n\"Why did I let it get to this point? I thought we were happy. We should've been family! How...\"\n\nLeo sits at the foot of his bed, holding himself in a straight up fetal position. Every day was just like this one, an endless wave of suffering. Even after he had made up with everyone and having been accepted, fate had to throw him another baseball that aimed straight for his head. He had abandoned his mask-persona of the everyday loser kid in school, Anon, fully embracing who he was in this wretched world. A murderer, a thief, a liar, a disappointment, and just like with his parents, someone who couldn't save the ones he cared for.\n\n...What was the point of even saving my friends in that shootout then? It was all for nothing. NOTHING. God apparently didn't care about how hard I tried to keep them safe from the scum of the world, even though I was fully prepared to die. What the hell did I do to deserve this fate?\n\nLeo shoots up from the edge of his bed, walking to the basement for another bottle of wine. In the gritty bedroom laid many more, showing just how far gone Leo truly was. Working with the gang far back gave him access to the finest wines the world had ever seen, some going as far back as 200 years. Popping open the top, Leo downs more than half of the bottle in one go, showing his practice from the 3 months he had to shrivel up and die alone. After he finishes it with another chug, he heads to the bathroom to take a good look at the abomination that he was in the mirror.\n\nConsistent glowing green eyes replaced the once-in-a-blue-moon black eyes from before. The bloodshot surrounding his irises along with the darkened veins coming from his neck to the eyes showed how much rage was stored inside of him. Leo started to wear his old gang attire after the shooting. The dapper black and grey striped suit and tie along with the matching fedora on his head contrasted the person that he tried to be before the tragedy.\n\n\"Look at you, you pathetic letdown. You're named after the greatest Greek hero in history and you hold up his name by being a wallowing coward.\"\n\"You're supposed to stare down the black wolf, not run away from it. You probably can't even handle the snow that he once did.\"\n\nHis parents decided to name him Leonidas, symbolized with bravery and boldness. It felt like that holding on to this name after the shooting was the worst disrespect he's ever given to anyone. He was disrespecting the dead, and that is something that no person on this earth should ever do.\n\nEven on graduation, he only appeared for a few minutes in Principal Spears' office to grab his diploma. Each second in that terrifying room had Leo and Spears looking at each other longingly. They both knew what true pain was.\n\nSpears knew, too, that Anon was gone. The eyes staring into his was somebody else's. It was as if Anon was struck with a bullet to his heart on that day, leaving only the corpse that is Leo to rot away in front of everyone.\n\nBANG BANG BANG\n\n3 loud knocks startle Leo out of his downward spiral, giving himself a furious glare in the mirror.\n\nWho could possibly want to bother me? It had to have been almost nine o'clock. Whoever's here is probably going to get the bullet. They can't be that important.\n\nBANG BANG BANG\n\nThat's odd. Usually if someone's looking for trouble they only knock once and burst in. This could actually be worth my time.\n\nLeo makes his way to the front door, each step feeling like they have an entire minute in between each and every one of them. He had almost never gone out that door. The world out there had nothing left to offer him. Suddenly, a voice calls out to the door before he could open up.\n\n\"Anon?\"\n\nNO, NO, NO. THIS CAN'T BE POSSIBLE. WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE? ... IT CAN'T BE HER, CAN IT?\n\nLeo gently opens the door to reveal... Trish. She begins to stare at him with infinite hatred before she catches a good glance at them.\n\nThese eyes... were someone else's.\n\n\"Anon-\"\n\nA slam in Trish's face cuts her off before she can say anything else. There was no way in hell he was letting the ghosts of his past haunt him again. It had already happened once, one more time could prove fatal. Not only mentally, but possibly physically as well. A muffled voice now full of desperation comes out of Trish's mouth once again.\n\n\"Anon...\"\n\"Please, we just want to talk to you.\"\n\nWe? Who else could possibly be there with her? One visitor is already enough of a hassle, two is just sheer madness. Screw this, there's no way anyone who may be out there is coming back into my life. I can't lose more than I already have, lest I die from the overwhelming grief.\n\n\"GO AWAY.\"\n\"JUST... DON'T.\"\n\"Please...\"\n\nLeo starts to hyperventilate with tears as all of the memories come rushing back to him in a picosecond. The Double Date. The scuffle in the car. The hospital. The band. The new vehicle. Naser. Naomi. Fang. Reed...\nA commanding voice from Trish yanks Leo from his second spiral that day.\n\n\"Break it down.\"\n\nWhat?\n\nBANG.\n\nLeo dashes away from the door and behind the closest wall, taking everything in. Not only had a ghost come back to him at the least expected time, but it looked like it was trying to kill him now, too.\n\nBANG.\n\n...Just what else could fate throw at me, huh? How badly did the chooser of fates want me to suffer? ...How do I fix this? How can I possibly fix my fate?\n\nCRASH!\n\nThe door flies off of it's hinges and onto the floor, scraping the wooded floor with the friction and momentum. Leo almost yanks the pistol out of his holster, preparing for the worst. Leo whispers to himself as the reverberating crash fades away.\n\n\"Come on, you dirty meteor dodgers... walk on in. You won't even get the chance to regret your actions before you're both corpses covered in your own brain matter.\"\n\nSuddenly, Leo's body turns cold at the realization of what he was about to do. He was about to kill two dinosaurs in cold blood, one of them being someone who he genuinely liked. Someone who he truly cared about in the end.\n...\nNo. I can't do this anymore.... I need to appreciate what I have.\n\n...Maybe that's why God is giving me the worst battles of all of them, it's as if I'm receiving a message. One that will stick with me for as long as I may live, and one that I have only realized now. It may have been late to the mailbox, but it's better late than never.\n\nIt appears, I am the one who must change.\n\n\"Come on out Anon, we just want to talk to you. Don't make this any harder than it has to be.\"\n\nQuietly unloading his pistol, Leo shoves the loaded magazine in his pocket, just in case things go haywire. If he was going to start becoming a better person, a good first step would be to not kill anyone the moment they look like a threat to him. Seeing the big buff companion next to Trish, he grips his pistol firmly and with a newfound determination.\n\nJumping out of the shadows, Leo slams the edge of the barrel onto the companion's vagus nerve, knocking him out in one swift attack. The now unconscious dinosaur slams onto the ground with a loud THUMP, shaking the house as his limbs also flop to the ground. Luckily, a hit like that will keep him out for at least a few hours. \n\nLeo places his pistol back into his holster in hopes that no more physical conflict is made.\n\nTrish is now posing as if she was frozen in a block of ice. She couldn't believe what was happening in front of her. Just a few seconds ago she wanted to pick a fight, but now all of the confidence that backed her along the way has left her behind. Even fear itself has abandoned her, leaving her only with shock and a bitter cold dripping down her back. Leo's glowing irises stare into Trish's, giving her the feeling of the Grim Reaper's skeletal hands grasping at her shoulders as it floats above her.\n\n\"What do you want.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Trish, tell me.\"\n\nMore silence... looks like I'll have to be threatening if I want her to talk.\n\n\"TELL ME NOW!\"\n\nTrish jumps back, starting to panic as she stares at the towering human in front of her. The person she was looking at was definitely Anon, but the way he was acting was the exact opposite of what she had predicted. What was thought to have been a pathetic terrified skinnie was actually a dangerous mastermind with terror's aura seeping out of him. Seeing as this method was going nowhere, Leo lets out a heavy sigh as he quickly nabs the pistol in his holster and tosses it to the ground, trying to tell Trish that he wasn't going to hurt her. However, the expression on her face doesn't change.\n\n\"Trish, just... please.\"\n\"Be honest with me.\"\n\nA sincere, guilty expression creeps its way onto Leo's face. Trish searches deeply for any sign of malice or manipulation, only to find none of it.\n\n\"Were you here to kill me?\"\n\nThe triceratops takes a heavy breath in and out. After what felt like a century to the two, she nods silently.\n\nThe two young adults sit and stare distantly for what must have been at least 5 whole minutes. The air had become completely stagnant, and dread boils the inside of each of their stomachs. Any more tension added would have broken the fabric of reality itself. After a silence that was way too long, Leo breaks the silence.\n\n\"Trish, I'm sorry.\"\n\"I'm sorry for meeting you all when you had the perfect life, I'm sorry for causing this horrible shitshow to happen to all of you.\"\n\nLeo's voice begins cracking as tears flow down, making him struggle to speak. His voice starts to quickly raise.\n\n\"I'm sorry for letting them die, I'm sorry for not stopping her in time, I'm sorry for being a total failure to all of you!\"\n\"I'M SORRY FOR RUINING IT ALL!\"\n\nTrish now saw the contrast between the man she once new and the one before her. The once awkward but happy Anon wasn't there, but rather a troubled, guilt-ridden gangster with his life nearing the end of the road. A stare into the watering, glowing green eyes had confirmed her suspicion.\n\nHe didn't just look and act like a different person.\n\n...He was.\n\nThere is no resemblance to Anonymous. Another soul had taken over his body. The human that everyone once knew has fallen into the void.\n\nThat happy human had to have been in there... somewhere.\n\nTrish slowly brings her hand up to the crying human, regret taking over her mind as she does so. She was initially trying to kill her friend, and for what? He obviously didn't want for this to happen, and he especially didn't want the guilt that he holds for it all. It was clear that Leo thought that everything that happened was his fault. Not only that, but he has to carry the fact that despite saving their lives, they were still caught by death's grip.\n\nTrish knows with certainty that if she had to live with that, she would've been long dead. Seeing Leo still alive brings back a memory from long before.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\"...Ripley said that I was the strongest person on Earth. I find that kinda hard to believe, don't you?\"~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNo, that is not hard to believe. Trish realized she was looking at a being with a stronger resolve than any other person in history, by a long shot. She utterly paled in comparison. She brushes Leo's cheek with her palm, the regret now rushing in like a tsunami into a populated town.\n\n\"Oh, Anon...\"\n\"THAT'S NOT MY NAME.\"\n\"...\"\n\"My name is Leo, Trish.\"\n\nTrish gives another look into the dry, incredibly bloodshot eyes. What she sees is the stare of a man who had died a long time ago, a decomposing corpse rotting with the smell of the smoke from the eternal fires of hell.\n\nDeath's gaze.\n\n\"Trish, I can't let you come close to me.\"\n\"Anybody that follows me around goes through the worst kind of pain imaginable.\"\n\"If you get too close... you're going to die. That's how it's always been.\"\n\"I've killed three people by allowing myself to bond with them. Please, Trish...\"\n\"Please don't do this, I can't let you do this to yourself. You're just...\"\n\"...You're just another sinner from the past.\"\n\"Why do you have to crawl back and torture me?!\"\n\nNo more sobs could have come out of Leo. This surprise visit had already taken everything he had left in his ducts. He desperately wanted to shed more tears, but his eyes were now like the Arizona desert; Beautiful, but empty and void of water. His glowing green eyes now show nothing but despair.\n\nTrish slowly begins to embrace Leo. He tenses up in fear for a minute, not really sure how to respond. Not only has he not felt this kind of embrace since Fang was around, but it felt like that someone was beginning to care for him again. Accepting the embrace, Leo gives Trish a hug of his own. She quietly sobs into his coat, her tears beginning to stain it. At any other time he would have been irritated about his best clothing dampened, but that does not matter anymore. Trish repeatedly whispers \"I'm sorry\" over and over again, almost faint enough to be inaudible.\n\nThe two survivors have stayed in the embrace for almost 10 minutes now. Trish's tears have all dried up, and the color starts to fade back in for both of them. They were no longer alone. After a long 3 months, two lost souls have finally found someone to lean on. Someone is finally there for the both of them.\n\nLetting go gravely slow, Leo and Trish stare into each other's shining colorful eyes. What was found in both pairs was something that each of them had been searching for, what they've been after for the longest time.\n\nIt was hope for the future.\n\nLeo finally speaks up again, voice still raspy.\n\n\"You don't want to leave me behind? ...You don't want to just forget about me and go on to live a normal life?\"\n\"No. I can't do this without you.\"\n\"Ano-\n\nTrish stops herself, remembering what Leo said about his name. However, he gives a slow nod, allowing her to continue.\n\n\"It's okay, you can call me Anon.\"\n\"Only you, though.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Anon, you're all that I have left. I just can't live like this.\"\n\"I want you to be by my side.\"\n\"Please...\"\n\"Will you stay by mine, Trish? No matter what happens?\"\n\nTrish stares into Anon's eyes, her gaze full of promise.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFor the first time in months, Anon and Trish smile. They had finally found their calling, their answer. They found the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\"Trish, I promised Fang something, and I want to fulfill it.\"\n\"I told her I would make her world wonderful, just for her.\"\n\"I intend on keeping that promise. I want to make the world better.\"\n\"I'm going to force the gang out of Volcaldera. I'm going to face the boss myself and finally rid the gang's presence forever.\"\n\"I'm going to fix Skin Row, and get the drugs out of our town.\"\n\"I'm going to find Reed and stay by his side, too.\"\n\nAnon stops with a long pause, and speaks again as the words come rushing back into his head.\n\n\"...But I can't do it alone. I'll need someone by my side.\"\n\"I need you Trish. I need you so that we can...\"\n\"Do it for her.\"\n\nAnon walks to the broken entrance, taking notice of the pouring rain outside. He takes in the smell of the fresh rainwater with a deep breath. Looking back to Trish, he slowly brings out his hand, waiting for her to hold on to it.\n\n\"Trish...\"\n\"Will you join me?\"\n\"Will you help me fulfill my promise?\"\n\nA warm purple hand grips Anon's with sincerity, the aura surrounding him changing to a familiar one as the green in his eyes dims. She had finally pulled him out of his shell, drowning away the previously violent, hopeless persona.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nAnd so, Anon and Trish went on to face the world.","Title":"A Suprise Visit Gangster Edition","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Trish and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One-Off","Author":"Lowkeyloki"},"A Surpise Visit Author's Notes And Misc.txt":{"path":["Trish","A Surpise Visit Author's Notes And Misc.txt"],"text":"9 - AUTHOR\u2019S COMMENTARY\n\nFuck you i\u2019m venting\/reminiscing \nI\u2019ll end up talking about all sorts of plot holes and other \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 shit as well as explaining a bunch of bullshit that doesn\u2019t really need to be explained, if you don\u2019t want to see that shit then don\u2019t bother reading this.\n\n>Chapter 1\nA good chunk of this was lifted directly from the \u2018alternate\u2019 version of this story (which was actually made first after a bizarre spark of inspiration the morning I woke up after getting Ending 1). There\u2019s a piece of my \u2018original intent\u2019 for this story that stayed in there. The \u2018NO\u2019 - nothing like it shows up anywhere else in the rest of the story. It was supposed to represent some sort of repression of what had happened in Ending 1 and Fang in general, which would also synergize with anxiety and PTSD and god knows what else. For better or for worse, I found out fairly quickly that I had no idea how to write PTSD and all that other shit, so that \u2018intent\u2019 ended up being scrapped pretty much entirely by the time I was done with Chapter 2. \nTrish\u2019s monologue about plans failing is lifted almost directly from my own life. Won\u2019t get into details but to say that shit almost went tits up for me because of my sheer fucking stupidity would be a massive understatement. \nThere\u2019s a part where Trish says that \u2018Fang\u2019s dad said something\u2019 that mentally destroyed her and caused her to re-evaluate her life in reference to Fang. I have no idea what this could be and it never really gets expanded upon.  \n\n>Chapter 2\nThis shit took me like a full week to write (although considering the size of 2-3 normal chapters I guess it isn\u2019t that surprising), and it\u2019s the only chapter to have an entire fully-written scene completely cut from it - the \u2018Unused Sequence\u2019 that follows this commentary shit, which was supposed to be during Anon\u2019s first walk to Trish\u2019s house. It\u2019s a clearer view into the \u2018original intent\u2019 that I had. It was supposed to be a PTSD flashback sequence, but - and thank Raptor Jesus I asked for critique before I went along with this - turns out that\u2019s not how PTSD works at all. It functions as a nightmare sequence well enough, or would with some trimming at least. Regardless, shit like that was supposed to be very prevalent throughout the entire story, with Anon suffering anxiety, panic attacks, nightmares, and all that good shit because of the events of Ending 1. \nAnother mention of Fang\u2019s dad that never gets elaborated on or resolved. Maybe it\u2019s for the best, but I still consider them mistakes. \nCringing hard at the \u2018Murphasaur\u2019s Law!\u2019 line and the bit of dialogue that precedes it, that plus the \u2018It\u2019s a little surprising that we\u2019re able to look back on high school without completely breaking down.\u2019 is a warning sign that the general pacing is going to get fucked. And fucked it gets. \nTrish\u2019s mom also doesn\u2019t really show up again. I had sort-of planned some sort of confrontation between her and Anon but I ended up just sweeping it under the rug\nFunny enough, the shit with the pictures was actually completely unplanned, and also hard as fuck to write. I can only hope I captured the sheer panic and terror and anxiety, as well as the following grief Anon was experiencing in those moments as well as I\u2019d like to think I did. \nThe shit with their first kiss was actually planned a decent while in advance. I woke up one morning, opened my phone and wrote pretty much the entire sequence from \u2018Our lips meet and the world around us melts.\u2019 to \u2018A dagger of ice pieces my heart.\u2019 At the time it was completely disconnected from the rest of the story, seeing as I hadn\u2019t even started that part of chapter 2 (or chapter 2 at all, I don\u2019t exactly remember), and the challenge was to get it to line up properly without being completely retarded. Whether or not I succeeded is up for debate. \n\n>Chapter 3\nThis one contributed to the fucked pacing pretty good. I enjoyed writing it regardless. A decent amount of plot and conflict advancement, Anon getting \u201ctricera-TOPPED\u201d as one anon put it, and just the general atmosphere was nice. Putting it literally the day after they spent an entire night crying their eyes out and being wracked with untold levels of grief was probably not the best idea. \n\n>Chapter 4\nRock Ring reference lmao. Was actually originally called \u2018Truth and Reconciliation\u2019 but that fit Chapter 7 better, but I still wanted the reference so I changed it to \u2018Two Betrayals\u2019. Trish and Reed kind of betray each other, right? Two Betrayals? Eh? Ehhh?\n\u2018Some part of me had expected whatever was going on between Trish and I to accelerate, but that part had probably watched too many mediocre Chinese cartoons.\u2019 My not so subtle attempt to reign in the broken pacing that ends up getting blown to bits two chapters later anyway. Oops lmao. \nI actually do like how I wrote Reed in this chapter (sorry Reedbros) and the general arc I planned out for him. \nAnd if you were wondering, when Anon excuses himself, Reed lightly grills Trish for an explanation of why Anon is there, she says that she just wants to have a good time with her friends, and Reed says something along the lines of \u2018How am I supposed to have a good time next to the guy that murdered our best friend?\u2019 \n\n>Chapter 5\nNot much to say about this one, tbdesu. Trish has her own mini-rooftop scene that I feel like I did a pretty good job of writing, and then they act cute together.\n\n>Chapter 6\nThis should\u2019ve been chapter 5.5 aka a non-canon shitpost with no actual bearing on the story, and not a full fledged chapter but oops lmao. \nThe original \u2018storyboard\u2019 was simply \u2018A\/C breaks on a hot day, shenanigans ensue\u2019, and boy, ensue they did. \nRegardless, the \u2018You have some fat fucking titties, Trish.\u2019 and the sentence preceding it might be my absolute favorite thing that I wrote in the entire story.\nThis chapter was also the first time I\u2019ve seriously written actual full-penetration smut. I enjoyed it, despite how difficult it was to concentrate at times. Probably could\u2019ve done more shit with the actual anthro features like Trish\u2019s tail but eh, details got fuzzy in the moment. \n\n>Chapter 7\nRock ring reference part 2 \nMore mom stuff that kinda gets swept under the rug\nReed gets his redemption arc \n\n>Chapter 8\nThis felt good to write. Genuinely just a good fucking chapter (or maybe I\u2019m just saying that because I just wrote it and I haven\u2019t been able to pick apart any issues with it who cares rofl xd lol). I didn\u2019t really know what I had in mind for the rest of the story when I finished chapter 7, I just knew that I had to start wrapping up conflicts and arcs because I was kinda reaching the end of my patience with the whole thing. The scope eventually ended up shrinking from maybe 3 chapters to maybe 2 chapters and then just pushing it all into a single chapter and tying it off before it could get out of my control. \nSome of it may feel like I was just writing off the various conflicts with a paragraph of text. And that\u2019s because I was. \nAs for the actual ending, that was something I did have planned pretty much since the very beginning. Not in that exact context of course, but the idea of Anon picking up a guitar and doing something with all the love and effort Fang poured into him was just too fucking good to not use. It might be an Ending 1 Anon but he at least picked the \u2018Play the guitar\u2019 option while in Fang\u2019s room. \nAs for Mr. B and \u2018Red Sun, Blue Moon\u2019, no there is no meaning and no it isn\u2019t an intentional Metal Gear Rising reference.\n\n>Chapter 4.5\nYeah I\u2019m talking about this, what a piece of shit chapter, goddamn. It being a shitpost doesn\u2019t excuse it from being fucking incoherent garbage. The idea I had when I originally thought of it was present at the beginning with the main character swap, but then it just morphed into some retarded bullshit meta-shitposting that never went anywhere and had nothing to do with what I was originally planning on writing. Fuck. \n\n\nUnused Sequence\nThe tightness in my chest and pit in my stomach grows with every step I take towards Volcano High. My attempts to reassure myself that nothing will go wrong barely help, and the mid-afternoon sun bearing down on me wasn\u2019t helping either. I turn that oh-so-familiar corner and come face to face with Volcano High. \nFlashing lights and blaring sirens assault my senses, police vehicles and ambulances surrounding the entrance. And the screaming, sweet God the screaming; a symphony of pure terror and anguish surrounds me, and I scream with them. \n\u201cFANG! NO!\u201d\nI need to stop this, I need to-\n*BANG*\nA stray bullet hits me in the leg as I start to run, and I immediately stumble and crash onto the concrete sidewalk. The pain, the heat, the lights, the sirens, the screaming, it\u2019s too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much.\nDon\u2019t leave me alone.\nPlease\u2026\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d A voice from above. A beautiful voice, full of caring and hope. I look up and see an angel offering me their hand. No - not an angel.\n\u201cFang!\u201d\nThe crippling wound in my leg no longer matters as I embrace my angel. I\u2018m trembling, crying, hyperventilating, but it doesn\u2019t matter. The nightmare is over. \n\u201cWhat the hell is with you dude?!\u201d Fang forcefully pushes me away, and I barely keep my balance as I stumble backward. Fang\u2019s eyes meet mine, her face full of confusion.\n\u201cYou hit your head or something? Need an ambulance?\u201d\nI look at Fang. Her eyes green and plain, her face noticeably flat, her voice strangely deep and masculine.\nI turn to Volcano High. The sirens are off, the police and ambulances gone, the screams quiet, the pain absent. \n\u201cOh fuck\u2026\u201d I pant as I lean onto a nearby wall, trembling.  I bury my head in my hands and slide down the wall, desperately trying to regain control over my breathing. \n\u201cHey. You gonna be alright?\u201d\n\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d I look up at whoever is trying to get my attention. A human, clearly worried about whatever just happened. What had just happened?\n\u201cI heard someone scream, I come out here and you\u2019re on the ground curled up and crying like someone just stuck you.\u201d I try to respond, but words fail me.\n\u201cWho the hell is Fang?\u201d His final word hits me like a blast of ice-water, and I suddenly become very aware of my surroundings. \nFang is gone. Volcano High isn\u2019t in danger. And I\u2019m sitting against the wall of some random business having a fucking panic attack. I let out a shaky, ragged breath.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine. Just...need a moment.\u201d \n\u201cYou sure? Cause\u2026\u201d I glance up as he trails off, his eyes on the school across the road.\n\u201cShit...guess you got a lot on your plate. I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d He walks back into the store. \nI eventually rise to my feet. Don\u2019t know how long I was down there. Don\u2019t really care. I\u2019m never stepping foot near this fucking place again. \n\nBY THE WAY\nFORTY-FOUR FUCKING PAGES IN GOOGLE DOCS\nGODDAMN THAT'S A LOT"},"Death At The Carnival.txt":{"path":["Trish","Death At The Carnival.txt"],"text":"Title: Death At The Carnival\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Trish, Tana and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One-off\nAuthor: Pshy\nSummary: Trish finds herself saddled with Anon at the carnival\n\n\n>The cacophony of lights and sounds is stunning\n>I had never been to a carnival before\n>When Trish asked the Fang gang if they wanted to go, I was the only one who spoke up\n>I got the impression she wasn't actually asking me\n>Too bad, trigga\n>Turns out the only reason she was going at all was to watch her little sister, Tana\n>A tiny hand grasped mine and tugged me forward\n>\"C'mon Mr. Mous!

Shaking my head, I pull open another box of our old things, searching for the camera that Trish promised would be in here. Through the open door, sounds of the engagement party drifts down the hall towards me: Trish regaling our friends with the story how I got down on one knee on the bluffs overlooking the sea, asking my old high-school nemesis for her hand in marriage. It\u2019s been two years since Trish came to apologize to me for what happened all those years ago at Volcano High, two years since Fang\u2026 well, since Trish and I bonded over sharded trauma. It was an unlikely relationship at first, Trish spending equal parts trying to gore me for something I said and stealing away around corners to shut me up with her kisses. As we spent more and more time with each other, we realized that our hatred for each other stemmed over the same thing: A love of Fang, as a friend and as a woman. Because of that, we carried a unique pain in our hearts that would never fully heal, and sought comfort with the only other person who we could confide in. \n\nReed\u2019s laugh booms down the hall at some unheard joke, rising above the collected voices. Reed, Stella, Rosa: The whole gang had shown up for the party, the first time we\u2019d seen everyone together for months. Each of us was dealing with the pain in our own way, and I suspected everyone was just happy to have something to smile about again. A smile of my own splits my face as I finally find the box I\u2019m looking for, an old dusty one at the back labeled \u201cpictures\u201d. \n\n\u201cJackpot,\u201d I mumble to myself, dragging the box out and splitting the tape open with my trusty pocketknife. I never gave up the habit of carrying it around, even though Trish and I had moved in together in a much nicer part of Volcaldera. It seemed Trish\u2019s parents were well connected in the real estate business, and were able to get the two of us a nice deal on a place not too far away from the local community college where the two of us attended. It was small, but with a storage closet full of our old things, clearly not small enough. \n\nI let out an oath as I rip open the box, seeing nothing but old photo albums and loose polaroids. Clearly a box OF pictures, not for things to take pictures with. Disgruntled, I move to put the box back before something catches my eye at the bottom: An unopened white bubble envelope, the faded address label listing my old apartment. It catches my eye like a vice, squeezing everything else out of my sight, out of my mind. The noise from the party dims as I thumb over Fang\u2019s old address on the return label. These must be the prom pictures Fang\u2019s mom took, right before it happened\u2026\nMy hands shake as I gingerly rip open the pull tab, a thick stack of photos wrapped in paper falling out. Having never been able to open them or throw them out, I must\u2019ve kept them, all this time, a glimpse into a past I wanted to forget. As I turned the paper-wrapped photos over in my hand, I see a hand-written message on the other side: \u201cShe would want you to remember who she was, not what she had done.\u201d Fang\u2019s mom\u2019s handwriting. \n\nSitting down on that dusty storage closet floor, I flip through the photos, tears welling in my eyes. My photo with Naser, us looking like a couple of dorks in our suits, arms around each other. A sob escapes my lips as I find one of Fang and I standing there in our prom outfits, smiles on our faces. Not a day goes by where I don\u2019t think about her, but I had forgotten just how beautiful she looked. The photos dredge up memories I had long since buried, memories of a time right before it happened\u2026 A tear falls on the photo, and I wipe it away quickly, my finger tracing Fang\u2019s face. \n\u201cGeez Anon, I thought you skinnies were good gatherers or something! Come on, my mom can just get the photos on her phone.\u201d At once, Trish\u2019s voice breaks me out of my misery. I can see her standing in the doorway, an elegant evening dress of green shimmering in the half-light. Catching my face, her face goes from an expression of happiness, to confusion, to concern, all the in the space of an attosecond. She\u2019s at my side at once, kneeling on the dusty floor with me, wrapping me in her arms as she cradles my head to her sizable bosom. \n\n\u201cOh, Anon, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s going to be okay\u2026\u201d Rocking me back and forth, Trish glances down at the photos as they spill out of my numb hands. Although I can\u2019t see her face, I can hear the strain in her voice as she fights back her own tears. \u201cI miss them too, Anon. Every day I miss Fang, but they brought us together, didn\u2019t they?\u201d Kissing the top of my head as I sob into her dress, Trish slowly strokes my bald head, rocking me back and forth like a baby. \u201cI didn\u2019t want things to end up like they did, but I\u2019m so glad at what you and I have become, and it wouldn\u2019t have happened without them.\u201d\nDrawing a shuddering gasp, I manage to get a hold of myself at last. Withdrawing my head from Trish\u2019s chest, I wrap her in a hug of my own, her tears falling wetly on my shoulder. \n\n\u201cI know Trish, I know\u2026 I miss Fang too, but I\u2019m happy now, happy with you. You\u2019ve made me grow as a person, helped me see them for who they were, and I\u2019m glad I can share that with you.\u201d Drawing Trish\u2019s face to mine, I dry her tears with my hand, laughing as she moved to do the same to me. Sharing a deep kiss, as deep as the one we had when I first proposed, Trish and I finally pick ourselves up, smiling at one another. Our hands entwine as we move back to the party, Trish complaining that I\u2019ve ruined her make-up. \n\nTrish and I may share the pain of what Fang had done, but there\u2019s no denying that without them, neither of us would\u2019ve found love. \n\n","Title":"Ending 1 - Anon's Got A Brand New Girl","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Trish and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"Short","Author":"Anonymous"},"Personal Demons (Concept).txt":{"path":["Trish","Personal Demons (Concept).txt"],"text":"Title: Personal Demons\nStatus: Complete\nCharacters: Trish, Trish's Mom, Tana and Anon\nRating: SFW\nClassification: One Off\nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\n:::::Original 4chan Trish Short Story Summary:::::\n>>39670220\n>In the AnonXTrish romance line, Anon follows Trish home to help her with practice and exam studies.\n>Anon hears arguing inside.

Trish started to look and not in a 'body height' sort of way. It was like every step closer to the door was leeching the life out of the spunky teen and transforming her into a timid girl.\n\nThey heared arguing from inside the house. Furniture was being shoved around.\n\nThe arguing died down.\n\nTrish slowed her pace and cringed. She turned to Anon.\n\nTrish: \"You should go, we can study tomorrow.\"\n\nAnon: \"It'll be fine Trish, we'll tell them we'll be upstairs studying for the exams.\"\n\nAnon standing next to her wraped one arm around Trish and gave her a snug shoulder hug.\n\nTrish: Ah- Don't you touch me, skinnie or I'll punch you right in the balls.\n\nAnon complied and shrugged.\nTrish whispered something to herself then anxiously took a deep breath and let out a shaky sigh.\nRight before anon turned the knob the door was flung wide open, an angry triceratops in a wife beater undershirt and ripped up jeans stormed out, separating Trish and Anon apart. An odor of pungent cigarette smoke and stale, alcohol stained carpet followed him from inside the house. He turns around into the doorway and shouted.\n\nAngry Boyfriend: \"Bitch you thought I wouldn't find out about that shit with you and Marco?\"\n\nTrish's Mom: \"I-it wasn't like that, he'sh jusht- was there! A-and we accidentally drank to much a-'hic'-and he was bein' so nice and- uh-\" \n\nAngry Boyfriend: \"And 'uh- uh- uh', Trigga bitch, I'm done! 'Fuck off outta here with your excuses!\"\n\nTrish's Mom: \"w-Wait-'hic'- baby!\"\n\nHer mom started stumbling towards the door from the living room, knocking down a lamp and bumping into a table. Anon could see Trish's kid sister curled up and crying in the corner of the living room next to a toy chest as Spongegar Rockpants plays on the TV in the background. Trish's mom leans on the porch railing crying the most artificial sob it'd make soap opera actors vomit.\nThe unfathomably uncomfortable cringe in the air would have made milk instantly curdle into cheese.\nThe angry boyfriend stormed off towards his car parked on the sidewalk. Every step he took made Trishes mom get even more furious.\n\nTrish's Mom: \"Wait you fucking ass-'hic'-hole! I'm talking to you!\"\n\nAngry Boyfriend: \"Drunk ass skank!\" *Car door slams*\n\nTrish's mom threw an empty beer bottle at the car but drastically missed with a loud shatter on the pavement.\nTrish immediately ran to her kid sister, hugged her and hushed the distressed child down. One of her mothers' beer bottles tipped over off a foot rest and soaked one of the little girls coloring books. Trish was quietly whispering curses at her mom, telling Raptor Jesus to just kill her now, and reassuring and calming the sniveling seven year old girl.\nTrish turns to you briefly, her eyes scanning the floor for her sisters favorite Patar Star toy. You can see the embarrassment in her distraught teary eyes. She gets down on all fours and shuffles through the toys strewn across the floor and accidentally crushes some crayons on her knees. \n\nShe finally found the toy and passed it over to her sister and gave her a big hug.\n\nTrish: \"Sorry Tana baby, I'll get you some new ones okay?\"\n\nThe puffy eyed girl nodded and cuddled with her Patar doll.\n\nAnon was stupified.\n'This was far from the Trish I know in school...' Anon thought\n\nTrish huskily whispered: \"A-anon go upstairs and wait for me at my bedroom door. Please!\"\n\nShe nudged her little sister to go play in the corner with her coloring books.\n\nMom: \"That- That fucking asshole Trigga fuck!\" \n\nHer mom bashed into a coffee table on her way back on to the couch. Her eyes smeared with wet eyeliner.\n\nMom: \"Trish! Get me another beer.\"\n\nTrish twitched like she was stuck with a needle. She gave a quiet huff and silently obeys, her eyes didn't seem to leave the floor.\nShe came back with the beer from the kitchen. She expertly popped the cap off with the side of the well abused coffee table strewn with cigarrette ash and sticky beer stains.\n\nTrish said in a shallow voice: \"Mom I brought one of my friends to study for a-\"\nMom: \"Trish, do you know what men are good for...?\"\nTrish: \"No, uh n-no mom...\"\nMom: \"Nothing. Ab-so-lutely Fuh--king Nuh-Thing!\"\n\nShe waves her newly lit cigarette around the couch, pocked with ash burns.\n\nMom: \"This is why you should never EVER respect men because they will never respect you for the woman you are! They'll take advantage of you! They'll lie to you! They'll spit on you! They'll rape you! And then after all is said and done, they'll leave you! They won't do anything good for you and-(rant continues)\"\n\nHer mom was unknowingly yelling at her as if they were in an argument. Trish's head sank in between her shoulders as she stood there silently looking at the ground. Her mother not realizing just continued on with her spat.\n\nAnon was upstairs listening to the drivel in disbelief.\n\nTrish raised her gaze towards her kid sister. Tana was trying to escape the stressful day by drawing a happy family under a sunny blue sky. During her mother's rant she was carelessly sprinkling ashes and smoke towards Tana's way as she was coloring in her book. Tana began to have a coughing fit, coughing quietly to herself to not attract her mothers attention. Despite her efforts her weazey coughs could be heard from across the house.\nTrish interrupts her mother's rant.\n\nTrish: M-mom, didn't the doctor say to -*She paused*\nHer mother was giving her a sassy headshake with a raised brow, waiting for Trish to finish her sentence\nTrish: - To stop smoking near Tana?\n\nMom: \"EXCUSE ME?! Girl, you don't tell me what I can and can't do in my own household.\"\nTrish: \"But mom it's not healthy for her-\"\nMom: \"Trigga, who pays the bills? Who feeds you two? Who bought you those clothes?? Who under this Raptor Jesus given green earth gave birth to you?\"\nTrish shallowly: \"You did- but mom\"\nMom: \"Don't but mom me child. Tana is fine, a little smoke ain't gonna hurt her. My momma and her gra'momma before her smoked around the kids and we grew up fine.\"\n\nShe takes another swig of beer bottle and motions Trish away as she resumes browsing Facebook on her phone.\n\nTrish light footedly walked over to Tana\n\nTrish whispered: \"What'cha coloring over here, baby?\"\n\nTana looked up with her big puppy eyes.\n\nTana: \"It's our family at the park.\"\n\nTana gave a big, but slightly pained smile.\n\nTrish looked over to the drawing and saw the crayon drawing of Tana, Trish, and her divorced father and mother playing in a park. The drawing of her mother had a smoke in one hand and beer bottle in the other.\n\nTana: \"I miss dad...I'm hoping he could come back and we could do that ag-COUGH-COUGH\"\n\nTana's sentence was interrupted with another lung constricting billow of smoke that drifted away from her mothers couch. \n\nTrish quickly lifted Tana up and nudged her towards the living room doorway.\n\nTrish:\"Go finish your coloring in the kitchen, okay baby?\"\n\nTana agreed while she tried to suppress her weazing coughs and walked out of the room.\n\nTrish scornfully glared at her mother, whom of which was busy with her phone. Trish turned away and gritted her teeth in a tearful frustration. From the mixture of anger and throat wrenching stress she attempted to quietly hyperventilate on her way upstairs, a futile attempt to calm herself down as every breath would seize up when a puff of smoke would touch her nose.\n\nAfter, Trish rushed upstairs to her room to find Anon standing quietly against the wall of her doorway.\n\nTrish's eyes resembled that of a miserably tired and abused puppy's. The excruciating embarrassment of having Anon: that dorky looking skinnie spear chucker, see how she lived was more painful than any physical harm she had ever experienced before. Her eyes teared up from both overwhelming frustration and emotional anguish. Trying to search her memories of even more painful experiences; Her father leaving the family behind. Her first break up in Primary school. The public embarrassment of Naser's concert. Hoping to find something to fall back on to reassure to herself that \"It's okay I've gone through worse\". She couldn't find it. She needed to funnel her anger and frustration into something. She turned to Anon.\n\nTough girl Trish briefly snapped back into reality and held anon by his shirt collar:\n\nTrish: \"If you tell anyone, ANYONE at school about this, I will personally gore you and pin you to the wall of the auditorium.\"\n\nHer fury was ignited and burning with a passion. Her hand clenched white and blood hot. She was the boss again and she was in control.\n\nShe looks into Anon's eyes expecting to see fear, disdain, irked disgust, or even defiance; reactions that she was familiar with and she could counter with her shear aggression. What she saw in Anon's eyes wasn't what she was expecting from him at all. A deep pity and bleeding sympathy. \n\nAnon: \"Trish. Are-\"\n\nThat dripping sorrow in Anon's eyes made Trish look away and wince as if her soul was cut with a cold razor. The flame in her heart instantly extinguished by her shame and her blood ran cold. She turned away from anon and embraced herself for comfort.\n\nTrish: \"Anon, I-i think you should go. I need to be alo-\"\n\nHer legs began to grow weak and the back of her throat felt like it was being twisted by a cold vise. The futility of her tough girl act was weighing her down physically and she was at the verge of breaking down and sobbing herself to unconsciousness.\n\nShe felt two arms wrap around her from behind and embrace her. Anon's head rested in between her horns. At that moment she felt a warmth she hasn't felt for a very long time. This warmth enveloped her body and released the cold clutch of hatred, anguish, and depression that was strangling her for so long.\n\nAnon whispered: \"Everything is going to be alright. You. You're going to be alright.\"\n\nShe shivered when hearing those words, the exact words she read in a human x dino romance novel she has secretly stowed away in her backpack. She slowly looked up to Anon. His eyes were closed, his complexion soft. He swaddled over her like an umbrella keeping the storm clouds away. She couldn't stop staring at anon as they stood there silently. Trish could feel a kind of emotional static charge build up inside her of which she couldn't really explain.\n\nThey both froze in place for a time. She, hoping that moment would last forever; and he, his heart bleeding out for her after the realization of what she was going through on possibly a daily basis.\n \nDown the staircase, Tana's bright puppy eyes were peaking around the corner seeing the two hug. Tana gleefully squee'd and skittered into the kitchen, inspired with the new crayon coloring artpiece she was going to make.\n \nLike a weight lifted from her chest she snapped back into reality, took a slow deep breath and nudged anon away. Anon awoken from the trance and reoriented himself.\n\n(And this is where I get tired and BS it.)\n\nAnon: So uh... we should...\nHe points to the room with the backpacks lying inside.\n\nTrish: Uh yeah-yeah the exam.\nTrish's voice pitch was higher. She angled her head, adjusted her hair and fluttered her wet eyes at him as she walked past him into the room and for a brief moment Anon thought he saw her smiling gleefully.","Title":"Personal Demons","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Trish, Trish's Mom, Tana and Anon","Rating":"SFW","Classification":"One Off","Author":"Anonymous","Summary":"::::"},"Some Race-Play Fetishist's Smut Fiction.txt":{"path":["Trish","Some Race-Play Fetishist's Smut Fiction.txt"],"text":"Title: Some Race-Play Fetishist's Smut Fiction\nStatus: On-Going\nCharacters: Trish, Fang and Anon\nRating: NSFW\nClassification: Short \nAuthor: Anonymous\n\n\nAs the last bell for the day rings and everyone streams to the exits, I find myself fighting against the crowd and working my way deeper into the school\nMy destination is clear in my mind, but it feel like the distance has doubled since I last walked here\nThe school auditorium, specifically the backstage doors\nWhat would normally be one of my safe, regular hangout spots at school is now a foreboding monolith of uncertainty\nAll because of one stupid text message\n\"Meet me backstage after school.

You're just going to study for midterms. With Trish. At Trish's house. With Trish. Alone. With Trish. \n...\nWow, that did not help. At least this alarm sounds new, I don't think I've heard this particular flavor of klaxon before.\n\"You say something?\" Oh right, Trish is here too. And I'm going to Trish's house. With Trish. Alone. With Trish. \n\"Yup, yup, all good here, all cool,\" I reply. How many times am I going to have to tell that lie today? \n\"Alright, anyways, so I\u2026\" The alarms drown out Trish almost immediately. Hope whatever she's saying isn't important. \n\"And we're here!\" Raptor Jesus, what? That was fast. I think. \nI take a moment to drink in where I would be spending the next few hours, or the rest of my life in some scenarios. Trish's house was actually quite modest, boasting only a single story, a small garage suitable for a single car, and a fairly small stripe of lawn that stretched to the sidewalk. \nTrish fiddles with a keychain that clearly has too many keys, tags and other random stuff on it, then finally slots a key into the door and turns it. She opens the door and ushers me in, closing it behind me.\nThe living room was surprisingly barren. There was a moderately sized flat screen TV on a console, a coffee table littered with random papers and office supplies, a dull but comfortable looking couch and not much else to speak of, leaving plenty of space to walk around in. Wonder if it looked any different during Triceratops History Month. \n\"So, uh, where-\"\n\"Not out here, follow me.\" Trish swiftly rounds a corner down a hallway, and I follow. Where else could we study?\nShe pops open a door and waves me inside, and the alarms return in full force. \nI'm in Trish's room. With Trish. Alone. With Trish. How on earth did this even happen? I mean, Trish had warmed up to me a little bit over the last few months, despite all the speciesist slurs and threats of violence she still hurls at me, but that surely shouldn't have brought me this far, right? \nWhat the fuck am I even thinking? We're here to study, not get laid. Raptor Jesus above, Anon, get a goddamned grip.\nI take stock of the room, and it's in complete contrast to the rest of the house. The walls are covered almost top to bottom with posters of famous musicians, artists and celebrities. The bulk of the floorspace was taken up by a bed and set of dressers, both of which seemed far larger than necessary for someone Trish's size. A pair of basses and a small pile of audio equipment sat in a corner, wires snaking around towards some unseen power source. \nTrish flings her backpack onto the bed and then dives onto it face first, letting out a drawn out groan. \n\"You brought the fuckin'...books, right skinnie?\" I unzip my backpack and start rifling through it.\n\"Yeah I brought the fuckin' books. Math, science, language, music. Where are we gonna start?\" Her only response is another groan.\n\"Music?\"\n\"I have that covered, if you didn't realize.\"\n\"Math?\"\n\"Reed actually helps me instead of just doing all the work for me, you know.\"\n\"Language?\"\n\"Mister Gobbledegook and his midterm can go fuck themselves.\"\n\"Okay, science it is.\" She lets out another frustrated groan like a teenage girl would. \n\"Shoulda picked something else. It's science time.\" I yank the bulky textbook out and toss it onto the bed next to her. Wait, this is not a good idea.\n\"Uh, where am I\u2026\"\n\"Get up here, idiot.\" Raptor Jesus save me. I clamber onto the bed and seat myself next to her. Trish sits up as I flip open the textbook to one of the chapters we covered. \n\"I guess we'll start here. How do you want to do this?\"\n\"I dunno, just...read it to me or some shit,\" she says noncommittally, lying back down.\nWork with me you...you\u2026\nMy thought is interrupted by what I can only assume is the garage door rattling and squeaking open, followed by a car engine getting closer and cutting off, then the garage door rattling and squeaking closed. \n\"Ah, look who's home,\" Trish says, not a single trace of emotion present. Must be mom, considering that's the only family member of her's that I've heard about, and only during rants. \n\nI look over to a relevant paragraph in the textbook and start reading aloud from it. I throw in one of the text's basic questions that do little more than reassure you that you know how to read, and Trish actually answers it correctly. Maybe she is paying attention after all. I continue for a bit until she leans back up and interrupts me.\n\"Hey Anon?\" Her voice was unlike anything I had heard from her before, like she was about to say something genuine and not insult me or anything like that.\n\"Yeah?\" I hopefully didn't sound too worried about what she was going to say. She reaches over and touches me on the arm and oh fuck fuck fuck-\n\"Can you do me a favor?\" Why did it sound like she was pleading with me?\n\"Y-yeah?\" I try to contain my panic and probably fail.\n\"Could you get some water from the fridge?\" You've gotta be fucking kidding- no, Anon. You're just an asocial idiot, panicking about extremely basic questions because they're from a girl. A pretty girl- anyways.\n\"Yup, water, can do. I'll be right back.\"\n\"Wait, Anon.\" Oh, I'm fucked now aren't I?\n\"If my mom says anything to you, just ignore her. She probably won't have anything nice to say.\" \n\"Oh, yeah, no problem.\" I leave the room and close the door behind me, taking a second to catch my breath. What the fuck is wrong with me? I nearly drowned Vulcadera Bluff in spaghetti because a girl touched my arm. Surely I'm not that pathetic, right? \nI eventually wander over to the kitchen and into the fridge, grabbing a couple of store brand bottles of water. I step back into the living room and a purple head with long, sharp horns and a glass of cheap wine in hand looks over at me.\n\"Oh what the hell, why is my daughter bringing home goddamn skinnies? Now you listen to me, boy\u2026\" I did what I was told and tuned her out, power walking back to Trish's room with bottles in hand. I enter the room and close the door behind me, silencing the buzzed triggout behind me. \n\"Told ya,\" Trish says, her voice strangely sympathetic. I murmur an agreement of sorts, handing her a bottle and cracking mine open. All that talking made me thirsty. \n\nOne bottle of water later and we resume our study session, but just a few paragraphs in, Trish interrupts me again.\n\"Hey, Anon?\" That same tone of voice from earlier. Relax, Anon.\n\"Yeah?\" More confident than last time, at least.\n\"I appreciate the studying help, but there is another reason I wanted you here.\" Oh fuck, I am not ready.\n\"It's about my mom.\" Oh, nevermind. Wait, what?\n\"Uh, what is it?\"\n\"Well, you heard her earlier, and I've talked about her a lot, she's kind of a bitch.\n\u201cAlright, but I don\u2019t know how you would want my help with that. I\u2019d only end up making things worse.\u201d\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s quite simple. I need you to fuck my mom.\u201d\n\u201cWH-\u201d My voice catches in my throat and I practically choke, violently coughing.\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean? Are you...oh, haha. I get it, you got me good there. Ha.\u201d She smiles warmly at me, her face full of a sincerity and understanding that terrifies me, but stays quiet.\n\u201cYou\u2019re...you\u2019re joking right?\u201d Still quiet.\n\u201cWhat am I saying, of course you\u2019re joking. You\u2019re going to bust out laughing any second now, and I\u2019m gonna laugh, and it\u2019s gonna be funny.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not joking, Anon.\u201d \n\u201cWhat? Trish, I am not going to fuck your mom.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d What the FUCK.\n\u201cBecause, I\u2026\u201d There are no wrong answers here.\n\u201cBecause I like you.\u201d Except maybe that one.\n\u201cOh wow, Anon, you...you just cost me ten bucks.\u201d What the fuck is happening to me.\n\u201cLike, it was pretty obvious, but I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually say it.\u201d I think I\u2019m just going to curl up and die. \nTrish slides over and wraps her arms around me, snapping me out of my spaghettastrophe. \n\u201cTrish, do you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPlease, just an ounce of reassurance.\u201d \n\u201cWell, if I say \u2018yes\u2019 now, it\u2019ll be cheating when you go fuck my mom.\u201d\n\u201cTrish, why on earth would I fuck your mom? I\u2019m pretty sure she hates me anyway.\u201d\n\u201cSee, that\u2019s the thing - she really doesn\u2019t. She just wants you to think she does to save face.\u201d \n\u201cWhat the actual fuck are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cShe likes skinnies, you dumbass. A lot. She doesn\u2019t like showing it, but she\u2019s totally jealous that you\u2019re here with me.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but that doesn\u2019t answer why I should do this in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said, she\u2019s a bitch, and she\u2019s gonna be a real bitch to me after you leave, and if I want to keep you around for more than a couple weeks, we\u2019re going to need her to stop being a bitch. Which is where you come in. Pun not intended.\u201d \n\u201cSlow down, I\u2019m not exactly Casanovasaur, considering I nearly died like two minutes ago just saying that I liked you. I can\u2019t go from that to seducing older women within minutes.\u201d\n\u201cAnon, if I didn\u2019t have the utmost confidence in you, I wouldn\u2019t be asking. You might be a colossal fuck-up, but there is absolutely no way you can fuck this up.\u201d\n\u201cT-thanks?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now, listen closely, this is important. She\u2019s gone through a few glasses of wine by now, so she\u2019s not going to randomly gore you just for looking at her. You just need to sit on the couch right next to her. She\u2019s gonna start bitching about skinnies, but it won\u2019t last long, she\u2019ll quiet down and start muttering about this and that, and that\u2019s when you scooch over and wrap your arm around her. It\u2019ll shut her up and make her blush, and that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re in. You don\u2019t even need to say anything, she\u2019ll pounce on you - in a good way, don\u2019t worry - and from there you just let it happen. Just remember, don\u2019t show weakness, but don\u2019t be too aggressive either.\u201d\nI take a minute to soak all of this information in and ask myself some questions. Is Trish worth it? Trish is cool and pretty and has nice boobs and is probably the closest I\u2019ve been to a girlfriend in my entire life. Is fucking Trish's mom worth Trish? She seems to think it's a good idea if she wants to 'keep me around'. I feel like there might have been implications in that phrase that are currently lost on me.\n\"Yeah, alright.\" \n\"Good, although I wasn't really asking in the first place.\" Of course she wasn't.\nI stand up and face the door, suddenly not wanting to move anymore.\n\"Don't make me push you out there. I will.\"\n\"Alright alright, jeez. I guess I'm gonna go...fuck your mom.\"\n\"Have fun!\" I walk into the hallway and close the door behind me. I can see the couch from here, a pair of horns sticking out from over the upper cushion, the TV tuned to some overdramatic trash. Raptor Jesus, protect me. I quietly shuffle forwards, eventually bringing myself around the arm and onto the cushion next to Trish's mom, quarter-glass of wine in hand. Hopefully not about to be in my skull. \nIn what should be completely unsurprising to me, she looks a lot like Trish. Incredibly purple from top to bottom, short, particularly well endowed. The only real difference, besides the age, is the tasteful thickness she had. It was hard to see the exact details under her casual wear, but she looks like she dated an architect at some point.\n\"Oh great, now the fuckin' skinnie is parading around like he owns the damn place, like this isn't my fuckin' house, you think you\u2026\" Just like Trish said, she's ranting about skinnies. It's partially slurred, but it sounds like nonsense anyway so it probably didn't matter. I keep quiet and sure enough, the arant reduces to a murmur of speciesist epitaphs and swears. Alright. Now or nothing. \nI wrap an arm around her, planting it on her opposite shoulder. She goes quiet immediately, and I can swear I heard a tiny yelp. I glance over and her purple face has turned a darker shade of purple, and she glances over to me. Our eyes meet, and for a few moments we just take each other in. \nFor a half-drunk triceratops, she's surprisingly agile as I suddenly find myself on my back, with the aforementioned dinosaur looking down at me and panting shamelessly. She leans down and aggressively plants her lips on mine. I wrap my arms around her and pull her into me, and she responds by grinding against my crotch and sticking her relatively massive herbivore tongue into my mouth. I thrust against her while trying to fight off the intrusive muscle in my mouth. \nShe pulls away and straightens herself, sitting directly on my now-erect cock. She expertly gyrates her hips while taking her top off, and I can only desperately latch onto her love handles and hump upwards as she reveals her delectable curves and large purple breasts, the dark purple nipples hard and perked. She falls forward again, and the world goes a beautiful shade of purple as I'm buried in her breasts. I frantically kiss, lick and suck every inch I can find as I reach further down around her waist, pushing her pants off. She shifts her legs back and forth and I can hear the flick of fabric impacting something further off, and a hand violently yanks at my jeans button, ripping the articles off and exposing my dick. \nShe wastes no time pointing my member upwards and plunging herself down onto its entire length. She lets out an impassioned shout as I hilt her and she goes into an aroused frenzy, her hips slamming against mine over and over as she rides me like a crazed animal. The sounds of slapping, squelching and moaning echo off the walls and surely carry on through the rest of the house as my mind and body revert to primal instincts, dedicated only to giving this horned reptilian woman as much monkey dick as possible. Her inner walls rub against my most sensitive spots as I hungrily try to plunge deeper than is even possible. She lets out a guttural moan and I feel her body tense and muscles contract against me, the sudden sensation causing me to echo her as it pushes me closer to the edge.\nIt eventually becomes too much, my hungry thrusts become rapid jackhammers as I reach the end of my rope, and another sudden contraction sends me screaming over the edge, waves of orgasmic pleasure washing over us as I fill her with cum and send my final parting thrusts before we collapse into each other. \n\nThe only sound left is that of our breathing. I look over and her eyes are shut, her limbs completely limp. I bask in the afterglow for a precious few more minutes before the reality of the situation starts to creep in. Just a bit longer\u2026\nI just fucked Trish's mom. Like holy shit. I was supposed to be studying and I fucked my best friend's mom. She told me to and probably wouldn't have taken no for an answer, but that's besides the point. \nRaptor Jesus as my witness if that smug purple slut calls me a motherfucker one time I'm using her horns as handlebars the first opportunity I get.\nSlowly but surely I wiggle myself out from under the passed out mom, and put my clothes back on. I groggily walk back to Trish's room and invite myself in, then collapse against her bed.\n\"See? Told you it was fine.\" I blissfully murmur nothing in particular.\n\"You're welcome, motherfucker.\" Trish snorts at her own awful joke and I groan. Handlebars for you, it is. Later.\n","Title":"Trish's Mom Has Got It Going On","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Trish, Trish's Mom and Anon","Rating":"NSFW","Classification":"One Off","Author":"SurpriseVisitor"}}};
