    "Fang": [{"path":["Fang","The Ptero and The Trigger.txt"],"text":"Once upon a time,* a ptero and a trigger worked** together in a garden.***\n\n*It was a Saturday\n**We were not paid. We were sentenced to beautification duty for spray painting the school wall with our bands' logo.\n***The pride and joy of a certain Ankylosaur.\n\nWe were there because we had to be there or face Spears' wrath. There was no bargaining or talking your way out of it. If you tried weaseling your way out of it or flat out skipping beautification duty, Spears would make sure you'd regret it. \n\nIn the first hour, the ptero cut the long wines that needed trimming with sharp sheers while the trigger held the ladder, for that was the task that required the least effort.\n\nIn the last hour, the trigger got them both stuck with weeding duty as punishment for munching on some Middlemist Red Camelias leaves.\n\nThe day dragged on to infinity, and the breaks lasted less time than it took to check if there were any new messages. Insects buzzed between the flowers, pollinating the plants and filling the air with the droning of their wings. Clouds were absent from the sky. A tree of silver wings, with mushrooms growing around its trunk and roots, provided some shade. \n\nThe ptero and the trigger passed the time by talking about their band.\n\nThese are the rules of Vvurm Drama.\n\nRule One. Any member can make suggestions about the band's future.\n\nRule Two. Every suggestion is settled with a democratic vote by its members. \n\nRule Three. Having a unique gimmick takes precedence over sounding good.\n\nRule Four. Always think bigger because there's merchandise to sell.\n\nHigh school bands typically challenge students musically more than those in middle school. The music increases in difficulty with more complex passages, intricate rhythms, and more involved phrasing. Selections also vary in style. A well-rounded band is expected to play a wide variety of music, ranging from serious 'program music' to lighter 'pop-style' music. For many high school students, school bands are the main form of music education available to them.\n\nAnd yet the typical high school band is nothing compared to the one where the ptero and the trigger play in. The discordant shredding of two bass guitars creates a cacophony equal to hundreds of cats being ritualistically sacrificed.\n\nThe ptero and the trigger discovered that there were many possible instrument combinations. A problem arose with unconventional band layouts. If the members were anything short of being masterful, the entire thing sounded off. When it comes to music, it either sounds good or doesn't. The ptero knew this, for she had been playing instruments since pre-k.\n\nAnd in time, the ptero became vexed.\n\nIt always ends the same,\" the ptero complained. \"Everyone always jeers.\"\n\n\"What do they know?\" I asked. \"They're just jealous.\"\n\n\"They're right. We sound terrible with two basses,\" the ptero complained. She kneeled to flick a patch of sod with her trowel. It struck an open flower, ruining its petals. The Ankylosaur would yell at them again for ruining her hard work.\n\n\"They're retarded,\" I said. \"When we make it big, everyone will regret making fun of us.\"\n\nWe would all become rock stars and make tons of money selling merchandise. The ptero will finally be happy, and it would be all thanks to me. All we have to do is hold on a while longer, practice a little more. The ptero got up and brushed the dirt off of her torn jeans.\n\n\"Every time we perform, people mock us. You might care about it, but it gets to me every time. I've been playing for most of my life, and what do I have to show for it? No one is going to give us the time of day because of this stupid...gimmick.\"\n\nThe ptero took hold of one of the long feathers with her hand, slowly rubbing it between her palm and thumb.\n\n\"I'm going to do something about it,\" she said. \"We need a new rule.\"\n\nI looked up in shock. I said, \"What? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"A special new rule. Something to...\" The ptero threw up her hands in exasperation. \"I don't know. To not make me feel miserable every time we practice. A veto that helps me not regret dedicating my life towards playing music.\"\n\nThe ptero begins pacing back and forth, \"The human was right. The band is supposed to be fun. I'm not having fun playing the bass just so we can have a dumb gimmick in a vain attempt to sell more merchandise.\"\n\n\"But we voted on it!\" I said, with rising panic|fury in my voice.\n\n\"No, that doesn't count. You can't have a democracy with only three members.\"\n\n\"We're gonna have to rewrite all our songs. If you start playing guitar, we'll be like any other band out there. I'll have to make new designs for the shirts.\"\n\n\"No,\" the ptero said. \"Either I can play the guitar, or I'm quitting the band.\"\n\nAnd thus, Vvurm Drama's layout changed to have the lead singer play the guitar. And I had to allow it for fear of losing my best friend. And I could do nothing but follow my true nature and try to convince the ptero that the human was a bad influence.\n\nI looked at the ptero.\n\nI looked at the phone in my hands.\n\nI discovered the human photoshopped himself kissing an anime girl.","Title":"The Ptero and The Trigger","Status":"","Characters":"Fang, Trish","Rating":"SFW","Author":"F4L","Summary":"The first doxxing"}],
    "Multiple": [{"path":["Multiple","Snootstiny.txt"],"text":"A torrent of red energy fills the air, promising destruction to anything it touches. A slender figure gracefully leaps behind a metallic pillar to take cover from the onslaught. Using the moment of respite, she focuses on the weapon in her hands. The gun is engulfed with a bright orange glow, a symbol of the raw power its wielder commands. Before the weapons fury can be unleashed, the owner is charged by dozens of seething machines. They care not for losses and move with a singular purpose, to expunge the intruder. Many are cut down, but for every one blown to bits, two more take their place. When enough of the metallic monstrosities are close enough to the woman, they simultaneously self-destruct.\n\nThe force of the explosions sends her clear across the room into her companion. The man instinctively grabs hold of her and retreats under the covering fire of the rest of the group. The machines sense an opportunity and unleash everything they have. Their efforts are fruitless, as the man carrying to woman forms an impenetrable bubble shielding the entire group. Even the woman, her body all but broken by the suicidal robots, has begun recovering. Shrapnel wounds disappear, her mangled wings regain their splendor, the damaged visor protecting her amber eyes becoming like new. \n\nEveryone begins focusing their firepower on the machine's leader. A bipedal metal horror larger than a house and with weapons powerful enough to level them. Yet the imposing monstrosity is no match for the group. After several seconds of being bombarded by all manners of explosives and fantastical abilities, it explodes in a shower of sparks and metal. Without their leader, the smaller machines prove no match and are quickly mopped up.\n\n\"Well? What do you think?\"\n\n\"It was kind of fun, but you said the game had great music. I heard nothing for most of the fight, Anon.\"\n\nBefore I can begin uttering the phrase 'smol indie company' the sound of an angry Stella fills our ears. \n\n\"God damn it! Another week without it dropping! Fuck bongo and fuck this game!\"\n\nFang gives me a puzzled look, \"What's she talking about?\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter. Let's go see what you got.\"\n\nFang moves her character to the final boss chest. Next to it are two dodecahedrons. One purple and one yellow. The moment Fangs' character passes over the yellow one Stellas' anger increases tenfold.\n\n\"Come the fuck on, on her first clear?! Fucking typical!\"\n\nStellas' shouting is replaced with the sound of plastic hitting a wall and a frustrated scream in the distance. Some days I wasn't sure if Stella was just pretending for the viewers or if she genuinely had anger issues.\n\n\nEvery step on the gruesome surface threatens to either pull off or simply dissolve her boots. The woman's black armor was slick with gore. Venturing inside the eldritch abomination was, unfortunately, necessary to end its life. Only one task remained, bringing the artifact to their allies. It needed to be purified or the nightmare would never end. A member of the team picked up the stone and everyone else followed them up and out of the creature's gullet.\n\nThe courier made it to the end of the gigantic tongue, when they vanished, leaving the artifact behind. Another member picked it up and the group continued onward. Out of the frying pan and into the fire. Immediately after exiting the gigantic monster, they were set upon by dozens of lesser creatures. A horde of twisted, twitching shapes covered in black ink charged them, determined to avenge their master. The un-burdened members provided covering fire while the runner focused on placing one foot in front of the other. Not long after, the second artifact carrier was plucked away by an unseen force. \n\nThe woman suddenly felt an overwhelming need to pick up the orb. Unable to fight her compulsion she grabbed it and continued the previous runners' journey. Her mind was flooded by promises of wealth, power, and prestige. Anything and everything, all she needed to do was wish it. Thankfully, before she caved, the woman was transported to a different place. The same place her compatriots were sent to. \n\nThey were desperately trying to push back the black tide that threatened to drown them. The woman focused on her anger and let it blossom. From her wings erupted hundreds of molten knives, each finding their mark in one of the inky monstrosities. Seconds later the black wave crashed back into the trio. From the churning mass rose a towering horror. It roared and spewed forth a torrent of flame at them. Her two companions were hit dead-on by the attack and expired within moments. The woman collapsed on her back, both legs and left arm ruined from the creature's attack. Suddenly, the black monstrosity shifted and was right upon her, its massive blade high above its head and ready to cleave her in twain. Before it could bring down the blade, the creature was slammed into by a bright blue comet, or rather a man temporarily transformed into one. \n\nHe pulled the woman on her already mended feet and moved to where one of their comrades had fallen. She went to the other and focused what little power she had left. In a few seconds, her teammate was standing before the woman, good as new, and mad as hell. For a few moments, it seemed like they could hold back the waves of nightmares. Yet, the atmosphere became increasingly oppressive and began sapping everyone's strength. \n\nEven the fifth members' appearance did little to help the situation. Their weapons ran out of ammo and were only good as bludgeons. The woman leaped on the back of a towering horror threatening to crush the man that saved them not even a minute ago. She tore at its throat with her claws in mad desperation, with little effect. Before the giant could bring down its foot a blinding light engulfed the area. The last member made it to their allies just in the nick of time, saving the rest from certain death.\n\n\"I can't believe it! We won!\"\n\nFang was ecstatic at our triumph. As much as it pained me to give bongo money, seeing her so thrilled was worth it. \n\n\"Yeah, yeah. Whoop-de-do.\" \n\nStella was far less pleased. The green steggo was starting to regret she convinced Fang to stream the game. Stella never expected Fang to exceed her viewer record in the few hours we were playing. \n\n\"Anyway, Fang, how are you enjoying your newfound celebrity status?\"\n\n\"My what?\"\n\n\"Don't play dumb, just look at how many people have tuned in.\"\n\nFang takes a glance at her streams stats, \"Oh, is five hundred a lot?\"\n\nStella stops talking, but from her angry muttering, it's clear she's still upset about getting upstaged so easily. I send her a text promising I'll fix this.\n\n\"You did great babe.\"\n\nHearing my voice sends Fangs' stream chat into a panic. The moment I appear on camera and pull her into a tight hug, the viewer numbers drop like a stone. Works every time.\n\n\nAbsolute chaos fills the once pristine hallway. Metal bends and warps, pipes rupture and spill their contents, stray gunfire pokes holes in the walls causing hundreds of small atmospheric leaks. Six figures run frantically towards the slowly closing blast door on the other side of the hallway.\n\nThey are pursued by dozens of insectoid creatures, all hell-bent on taking them down with them. With their pursuers rapidly gaining on them, the midnight-clad woman leaps into the air. Power courses through her and a bow of pure energy materializes in her hands. She lets loose a single arrow, instantly killing the first creature it hits. The thing's corpse doesn't even hit the ground before tendrils burst out of it and shackle every other pursuer. The beings struggle to break free, granting the fleeing party precious seconds to get to the almost closed blast door.\n\nOne by one, the group ducks and slides through the ever-narrowing opening. The woman is the last one among them to pass through. She tucks her wings to her body and just barely manages to slip under the bulkhead before it fully closes. Moments later, there is a pounding heard from the other side of the door, followed by a loud crash. Another loud impact quickly follows, this time slightly deforming the blast door.\n\nThe beast on the other side can rage all it wants, it doesn't have long anyway. The team was assured this room would somehow allow them to survive the crash. Strapping in and hoping they weren't deceived is all they can do right now. A large hand grabs the black-armored woman by hers and gives it a reassuring squeeze. Seconds later everyone is knocked unconscious as the station makes violent contact with the icy moon's surface.\n\nAn unknown amount of time passes, but finally, there is movement inside the twisted wreckage. The woman pushes herself up from the floor, vision blurred and ears ringing. Her teammates also begin showing signs of life and together they slowly make their way out of the wreckage.\n\nA little while later the group reaches a small clearing strewn with the guts of the deorbited space station. They walk past a particularly large pile of scrap, which suddenly explodes, revealing the creature they were escaping also survived the fall, although not unscathed. Its lower body was replaced with a hovering mechanical platform. The cybernetic abomination screams with rage and charges the group.\n\nAt first, all weapons seem ineffective against the mechanical horror until a lucky shot hits one of the platforms' engines. With its weak point identified, the six quickly get to work. Before long, all the other engines are destroyed and the thing crashes to the ground. Static fills the air and within moments several large pieces of scrap are flying through the air towards the group. An unlucky member doesn't dodge a hunk of magnetized iron in time and is knocked unconscious.\n\nThe black-armored woman begins running towards the creature, deftly dodging the metal storm determined to cut her to pieces. She leaps over the crippled monstrosity as it tries to slice her to ribbons with its metal claws. The woman plants her shotgun to the base of the alien's neck and pulls the trigger. Hunks of metal crash into the ground, no longer held aloft by the twisted alien, its head slumping forward as it hopefully expires once and for all. \n\n\"Eat it, bitch!\"\n\nFangs' joyous expression is mirrored on Stellas' stream. This time, she is just part of it, instead of having her own. Something about not stealing the steggos viewers. The ptero looks at her phone to check Stellas' chat. One viewer has proclaimed he was 'Fangs' little pogchamp', whatever that meant. An argument quickly broke out, many other viewers were not willing to give up the coveted title without a fight. \nFang puts down her controller and embraces me. Just as we're settling in for a cuddling session she can't help but ask something that has been bothering her for a while.\n\n\"Anon, what's a 'pogchamp'?\"","Title":"Snootstiny","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Anon, Stella","Rating":"SFW","Author":"F4L","Summary":"The trio play a game"}, {"path":["Multiple","Battle of the Bands.txt"],"text":"School is over and the Fang gang can finally relax for a few months before college begins. At least that's what I had hoped would happen. Instead, Trish had managed to convince both Fang and Reed to have another concert. Fang wanted to just have another concert at Moe's, while Trish was looking for something grander. Reed in his typical carefree fashion was OK with whatever venue the girls decided to pick. While the girls were arguing about the optimal venue size I decided to gamble a little bit. Without telling any of them, I sent footage of the bands' concert at Moe's to the upcoming Volcaldera battle of the bands event organizer. I didn't want to get the trios' hopes up, only for them to be rejected. The organizer must have been impressed by the bands' performance because only a few days later I got an e-mail stating that Vvurm Drama is now an official participant. I call up Fang to set up a band meeting.\n\n\"Hey, sweet tooth, what are you up to?\" A groan is heard before I get a reply.\n\n\"We're about to head out again, hopefully, this time we'll finally settle on a place.\"\n\n\"You guys should put that on hold. I have some news.\" There are a few seconds of silence before Fang speaks up.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"Oh no, I'm only telling you guys in person.\" I can hear the trio talking in the background for a few moments.\n\n\"Alright, we'll come to pick you up. It better be good news though.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, Reeds' van pulls up to the curb near my apartment. I quickly clamber inside before the locals do anything stupid. All of them try to get me to spill my guts, but it proves fruitless. I'm only telling them when we get to the nearby bar. Mostly so we can celebrate, but also so I have witnesses if Fang or Trish decide they do not appreciate me going behind their backs. We walk inside and sit behind the cleanest table booth. The Vvurm Drama members are starting to get impatient, but I assure them it will be worth it, we just have to wait for our drinks. Finally, the waitress brings us our order, a few minutes longer and Fang would have wrung the secret out of me.\n\n\"Alright, don't be mad, but I sent footage of your concert at Moe's to the Volcaldera battle of the bands organizer\" The trio is not particularly thrilled at first until they realized I wouldn't have dragged them here if I had bad news. Trish is the first to speak up.\n\n\"What did they say? They liked us but had no slots left? That we had potential? Come on, spit it out already!\" I chuckle for just a moment to draw out the suspense.\n\n\"You got accepted, the event is next month.\" They stare at me for a second before realization sets in. Reed and Trish are happy as can be, while Fang pulls me in for a hug.\n\n\"Can't say I appreciate you going behind our backs, but I'll make an exception this time.\" \n\nWe finish our drinks and order another round to celebrate. The initial excitement wears down and the band begins discussing their plans. Reed is the first one to speak up.\n\n\"We better start practicing though, don't want to be the worst band of the bunch.\" Trish also gives her thoughts.\n\n\"We need somewhere we can practice in peace. Preferably a single spot so we don't have to lug our gear around too much and waste time.\"\n\n\"I'll talk to my parents. Pretty sure I can convince them to let us use the garage.\" I give Fang a skeptical look.\n\n\"And how exactly are you going to convince your dad to let the band practice at your place for a month?\"\n\n\"That's easy. I'll talk to mom and mom will talk to dad. Dad will have to move the car out of the garage because I'll let mom take plenty of pictures of us practicing.\" The rest of us can't help but laugh at the thought of tiny Samantha bossing Ripley around. Reed has a single request though.\n\n\"Just tell her to turn off the flash on her camera. I don't want to be blind by the end of the month.\"\n\nThe next day I take the bus to the Aaron residence. When I arrive I already see Trish and Reed moving their gear into the now empty garage. Fangs' mom must have immediately put the squeeze on Ripley. Soon the band begins their first practice session. A few hours in Fang calls for a proper break. Everyone is exhausted and her voice is starting to become strained. The ptero asks Trish to come with her while Reed and I just chill.\n\n\"How are you holding up man, nervous like the girls?\"\n\n\"Nah bro, as long as I got this,\" he shakes his ever-present thermos, \"I'm cool as a cucumber.\" After taking a sip from it the pink raptor continues. \"We really need a lot of practice though. Doing well would mean a lot to the girls, especially Fang.\" He stops to take another sip, \"I won't lie and say I don't hope we win, but even placing high would be an achievement.\"\n\n\"Yeah, the girls probably think the same. Speaking off, I'll go check on them, they've been a while.\"\n\nI don't have to go far to find the two ladies, Fang is leaning against Reeds' van talking to Trish.\n\n\"-say, Trish? Please?\" I didn't hear whatever it was Fang asked the purple triceratops, but it must have been important. Trish just stares at Fang for several seconds before suddenly hugging her.\n\n\"Of course, how could I say no?\"\n\nTrish is acting uncharacteristically emotional, hopefully, it isn't anything bad. Fang seems both relieved and a little taken aback at Trishs' reaction. I clear my throat to let the girls be aware they're not alone anymore. \n\n\"Sorry to interrupt, everything OK over here?\"\n\nTrish quickly lets go of Fang and does her best to appear nonchalant. \n\n\"Y-yeah, everything is fine. Just some girl talk is all.\" Fang starts making her way back into the garage.\n\n\"Well, break time is over, back to practice.\"\n\nVvurm Drama goes through all the original songs they've ever played, picking and choosing which ones would make the best impression on the crowd. Some are dismissed, some require changes to the lyrics. Reed writes down which songs require further polish and takes some suggestions from all of us. It's gotten late and I have bid farewell to the trio or I'll miss the last bus.\n\nMorning comes and I do my usual routine. Face-plant the ground, shovel cereal into my mouth, and go to the bus stop. By the time I arrive at Fangs' place, the band is already practicing. Reed has made some lyrical improvements and the band as a whole is ever so slightly better. A good while later Trish calls for a break. \n\n\"I know we have a lot of work to do, but I can't even hear Fang singing over my stomach growling.\" Everyone quickly comes to the same conclusion as the diminutive triceratops. We barely start talking about what to get when Naser appears at the garage entrance.\n\n\"I heard you guys were hungry, so I ordered some pizzas from Moe's. My treat.\" He looks at me before continuing, \"We just have to go pick them up. Anon will help me with that while the rest of you take a breather.\"\n\nI barely manage to take my seat before Naser hits the gas and the NasCar peels out of the driveway. We arrive at Moe's in record time, although at the cost of me losing several hours of life expectancy thanks to Nasers' reckless driving.\n\n\"Alright Anon, I'll wait out here in the car while you go get the pizzas. Don't worry, they're already paid for.\" With payment already taken care off I'm in and out of Moe's in a flash. It doesn't take long before we're on our way back.\n\n\"Thanks for signing up the band for the event, Anon. I know you didn't tell them from the start to spare their feelings if they didn't make the cut.\"\n\n\"No problem, I guess. Besides, they're doing all the work.\"\n\n\"Exactly. That's why I was thinking you and I do our best to help them with whatever they need so they can just focus on practicing.\"\n\n\"Uh, sure. Although, I was kinda hoping to watch them practice and give feedback.\"\n\n\"Remember how happy Fang was when people cheered for the band at Moe's and for her at prom?\"\n\n\"Of course, but what does tha-\"\n\n\"Remember how hard she practiced for prom? She's going to practice ten times harder for this. We need to do everything we can to ease her burden. Helping Vvurm Drama win the contest would mean the world to her.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're right. Sure, I'll help with anything she needs of me.\"\n\nThe moment we're spotted pulling into the driveway the band drops their instruments and makes their way towards us. Their desire for greasy pizza far outweighing everything else. The NasCar is ransacked before I even unfasten my seat belt. The only survivor is a lone box of meateor lovers pizza. I make my way to the empty spot Fang is tapping, pizza in hand. The ptero has a wide grin on her face. Whether it's because she's happy to see me or the extra pizza I'm not sure. Fang has somehow managed to devour three-quarters of hers already. \n\nHow she manages to stay so thin is a mystery.\n\n\"I already told you Anon, doctors said I won the genetic jackpot.\"\n\nOh god, how much did I mumble?\n\n\"Pretty much everything. I'm much happier to see you than the pizza if you really must know.\" I take a seat next to Fang and open up the box. With the help of my ptero girlfriend, we cut the poor pizzas' life extra short. Its sacrifice will be remembered. \n\n\"You know, Naser and I were talking. Agreed we'd do errand runs and stuff like that so you guys could just focus on practicing.\"\n\n\"That's so sweet of you Anon. I'll make sure to make it up to you, just after the concert, OK?\"\n\nFang gives me a quick hug and a peck on the cheek before she picks up her guitar and the band restarts their practice session. I stay with them for a few more hours before I have to take my leave and head for the bus stop.\n\nI spend the next few weeks as being Vvurm Dramas support staff. I watch them play as much as I can, but a lot of time is spent doing various tasks to make their lives easier. Be it getting them food, various bits from the music store, picking up the new T-shirts Trish designed for the band, bringing the band merchandise to the venue a few days before the event, and so on. The day before the event is here. I arrive bright and early at the Aaron residence, but like always, the band is already there. The long hours spent practicing are really showing. The lyrics flow smoothly and the band members are in sync like a well-oiled machine. I've listened to them for so long I know all the lyrics by heart. My reverie is interrupted by a bright flash. While Samantha remembered to turn off the miniature sun that resides in her camera on most days, this wasn't one of them.\n\n\"I'm sorry dears,\" she giggles for a bit before continuing, \"Just letting you know dinner will be ready in about an hour, so don't stuff yourselves with junk food.\" The ptero matriarch leaves and the rest of the bands decide to take a quick break. \n\nI make my way towards the group before a gigantic clawed hand stops me in my tracks.\n\n\"Boy, a quick word.\"\n\nI'm shepherded towards Ripley's car, too focused on not shitting myself to object to the abduction. I take the front passengers seat and wait. Moments later Ripley gets into the driver seat, the car lurching as the patriarch sits behind the wheel. My imagination is running wild with possibilities. Did I do something to piss off Ripley? Is he going to snap my neck and dump my body into the sea? Not like I had any alone time with Fang for the last month so hopefully, that isn't it. Ripley clears his throat to get my attention. His voice is neutral, so I can't gauge just how much trouble I'm in.\n\n\"I'm still not a hundred percent sold on you, boy. But I have to admit you've had a profound effect on Lucy in the few months you two have known each other.\"\nRipley lets out a long sigh and is silent for a few moments. I decide to stay silent and hope he eventually continues.\n\n\"I was worried we were close to losing her,\" a low chucked escapes him, \"But apparently all she needed was someone like you in her life.\"\n\nThe car comes to a stop in an empty street, not a single soul in sight. \n\n\"I'm thankful for all that you've done for her boy. It's obvious to even an old fossil like me how she feels about you.\" The patriarch puts his oversized hand on my shoulder and gives me a stern look that freezes my blood.\n\n\"If you break her heart or if I find even a single feather out of place on my little angel...\" The grip on my shoulder tightens enough to make me wince.\n\n\"...I'll make sure you regret being born. Understand?\" I can barely manage to nod my affirmation.\n\n\"Good. Don't take it as a threat, take it as a promise.\"\n\nWe spend the ride back to the Aaron residence in silence. The feeling in my left arm returned after a couple of minutes, hopefully, no permanent damage. The car comes to a stop and I see Samantha ushering the musical trio into the house. Dinner was ready and she would not allow it to get cold because the band wanted to keep practicing. Before I even close the car door Fangs' mom is already next to me.\n\n\"Do you want to have dinner with us Anon? I made plenty.\" Ripley replies in my stead and his voice makes it clear there will be no arguing.\n \n\"Of course the boy will join. He's earned it.\"\n\nThe matter settled without my input, I make my way inside the house. Ripley takes his seat at the head of the table and I take the one Fang has been saving for me. Do pterodactyls have telepathy? Doesn't matter, the food smells great and I'll finally be able to spend some time with my ptero girlfriend that isn't band practice. Dinner goes smoothly, Ripley not looking at me with murderous intent if I so much as touch his daughter greatly contributing to the good mood. I had so much fun I forgot what time it was and missed the last bus. Thankfully Naser volunteered to drive me to my apartment and even pick me up tomorrow. \n\nJudgment day has arrived. I barely got any sleep, spent most of the night tossing and turning, thinking about how the band would perform. I wasn't even the one that would be on stage. I can only imagine what the trio is going through. The hours feel like days before I get a text from Naser saying he's coming to pick me up. The NasCar comes to my apartment and doesn't come to a complete halt. Instead, I have to run next to it and jump inside. Naser is taking no chances in this shitty neighborhood. I finally manage to get properly seated and put my seatbelt on. Just in time too, as Naser once again puts the pedal to the metal and we're almost launched into the air as the NasCar goes over a small hill. \n\nWhat should be a half-hour drive, takes a little over ten minutes. Thank god I don't have hair or they'd start going gray, maybe that's why Fangs' hair is the color it is. Even this early, a crowd is already forming. We make our way backstage to where the gang is waiting. We quickly spot Reeds' clunker of a van and the musical trio are all there. Reed is sitting in the back of the van, fiddling with some of the bands' equipment. Trish is leaning against the side of the vehicle, eyes closed in thought. Fang is pacing to and fro, already wearing a groove into the patchy grass. \n\nThe moment our eyes meet, she slightly relaxes. The surroundings fade away and we can't help but go to each other. When I get close enough I take her hands in mine.\n\n\"How are you holding up?\"\n\n\"Excited. Nervous. Terrified.\" I pull her into a hug to comfort her.\n\n\"You'll do great.\" We just stand there, embracing each other for a while until we're interrupted by Trish.\n\n\"Alright you two love birds, break it up. There'll be time for that after our show.\" She holds up two T-shirts with 'Vvurm Drama' printed in bold letters surrounded by a pair of bat wings.\n\n\"Put these on, we need everyone to know our name.\"\n\nThe five of us put on the shirts over our regular clothes. The shirts are surprisingly comfortable, Trish didn't cheap out on the material choice. For a moment, everyone forgets about the concert and just jokes around. Even then Trish can't help herself.\n\n\"When we make it big, these things will sell for thousands as memorabilia. How many do you want to buy Anon?\"\n\nWonder if she has any rhinorex ancestors. We don't even notice the show had already started. The first band started playing and they don't sound half bad. Of course, everyone keeps repeating that while the guys on stage sound OK, they're not nearly as good as Vvurm Drama. After a while, the band ends, and the final cheer of the crowd is their score. The cheers are middling, even with a large crowd already in attendance. Time passes, more bands come and go and soon day turns into evening. \n\nThe latest band is finishing up, with Vvurm Drama being next in line. The members have psyched each other up and are itching to get on stage. The curtains on the stage falling are our cue. The previous band is scrambling to get their stuff off stage, while we're bringing ours on it. Naser and I bring on the heavy equipment, while Reed is setting up the lights on stage. Just as we put the last piece in place the announcer gives us our two-minute warning. I give Fang one last hug before getting off and joining the audience. There's got to be several thousand people there now. It's going to be a struggle making it to the front but I have to try. Vvurm drama starts playing and the crowd is making it known they like what they're hearing. I do my best to try and squeeze through the partying crowd and avoid getting an elbow to my face. I'm only partially successful on the latter. Fang has noticed me a couple of times in the crowd, but can't do more than slightly smile for a few seconds before returning her focus on the song. \n\nI've almost reached the front, one of the last hurdles being a hulking gray figure. I tried squeezing past him to no avail. The guy turns around, clearly upset. He gets into my face and starts shouting, partially in anger, partially so I can even hear him at all.\n\n\"Hey bro, what's your problem?!\" Isn't this the guy Stella went to prom with?\n\n\"I'm just trying to get to the front!\"\n\n\"Maybe you should have come earlier!\"\n\n\"Come on man, my girlfriend is playing!\" His expression changes from angry to excited. I doubt he recognizes me from school, so hopefully, he's sympathizing with my current struggle. \n\n\"No way. Which one?!\" he points a finger at Trish, \"Is it the purple chick?!\" I do my best to not shudder at the thought. \n\n\"No! The other one! The ptero girl!\"\n\n\"Whoa, you're one lucky guy! Go get to her then!\" The shark guy gives me a thumbs up before lifting me over and in front of him. My triumph is short lived thank to two even larger dinos in front of me. \n\nThe current song ends and Fang grabs the microphone. She is tired, sweaty, and completely in her element.\n\n\"Thank you Volcaldera, you've been amazing!\"\n\nThe crowd starts cheering like all of them when a performer mentions the place they're at. The ptero does her best to catch her breath while waiting for the crowd to settle down again.\n\n\"Before we finish, we'd like to play one last song! This one is dedicated to a very special person in the crowd tonight!\" Fang steels herself and takes a deep breath before continuing.\n\n\"I love you Anon!\"\n\nThe crowd once again erupts into cheers, while I'm standing there dazed from what just happened. I feel the same way about her, but I don't know if I'd have the courage to say it in front of such a large crowd. I look up at the stage and see Fang has begun to sing. Thankfully I'm close enough to the stage to hear her, if only just.\n\n♫40 days and 40 nights♪\n♪I waited for a guy like you to come and save my life♫\n♫All the days I waited for you♪\n♪You know the ones who said I'd never find someone like you♫\n\nThis isn't like any song I've ever heard the band play. Instead of their regular intense rock stuff, this one is softer, upbeat, and a little cheesy as far as the lyrics go. The important part is that it's Fang singing it, which makes it the greatest song I've ever heard. I'm snapped out of my trance when a massive gray hand grabs me.\n\n\"Bro, didn't you say that was your girlfriend!?\" I can only nod, the whole ordeal has overwhelmed me so much I'm starting to choke up.\n\n\"Why are you standing here like an idiot then?! Go to her!\"\n\nThe sharkman notices the obstacle in front of me. He pushes the two dinos apart just enough for me to slip through. He gives me a thumbs-up before letting go and the two living barricades slam back together. The first chorus has ended and Anon once again focuses on the song.\n\n♫From time to time I pinch myself♪\n♪Because I think my guy mistakes me for somebody else♫\n♫And every time he takes my hand♪\n♪All the wonders that remain♫\n♫Become a simple fact♪\n\nI turn around to my right, only to be greeted by the face of a familiar Ankylosaur.\n\n\"An-on, you finally made it!\"\n\n\"Yeah, just barely! Didn't think you are into this kind of music!\"\n\n\"I'm not, but when I heard my friends were playing I just had to come!\"\n\nWhen the second chorus ends, the lighting on stage changes from bright yellow to a softer blue. Significantly more impressive than the light change is what happened to Fang. Suddenly her body and wings are aglow with intricate blue patterns. I can only stare until I'm grabbed by someone yet again. This time the lucky grabber is Rosa.\n\n\"Why are you just standing here stupid?! Go!\"\n\nBefore I can say anything I'm already launched up onto the stage. Thankfully the stage isn't very high up so I quickly recover from the Mexican launch. I pick myself up and look at Fang who has just finished the final chorus of the song. She stops singing, leaving Reed and Trish to pick up the final vocalizations of the song. Fang places the guitar on the floor and slowly makes her way to me.\n\nEverything that isn't Fang fades into the background, the roar of the crowd only barely perceivable. When we finally reach each other Fang puts her arms around my shoulders.\n\n\"Thank you for everything Anon. How can I ever repay you?\"\n\nInstead of saying anything stupid that would ruin this incredible moment, I just lean towards Fang and kiss her. After a few seconds, Fang pulls back slightly and gives me a smirk.\n\n\"I think we can do better than that\"\n\nThis time she's the one to initiate the kiss and nearly forces me to the ground. The crowd is going absolutely nuts. If this was the metric, then Vvurm Drama won the event by a landslide. The performance over, Trish and Reed run up to the mic to close out the bands' performance. Just before the curtain starts going down they both grab the microphone.\n\n\"Thank you Volcaldera!
