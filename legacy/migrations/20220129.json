As she swished the old-fashioned feather duster back and forth along the top of the fridge, her thoughts stewed in her head, bubbling wildly. It wasn’t necessarily that they took her places she didn’t want to go, but she was afraid they might. The longer she was idle for, the more likely it was.\nDully she wondered if she wasn’t way too young to be this tired. For a long while, she’d started each day wondering what reason she might have to get out of bed, then remembering that she had too many people that she’d be letting down if she gave up. She’d only even started bothering to get her associates because of a promise she’d made. That and her mother’s insistence that getting out there and doing something, even something small, would help. It had, a bit, she supposed. It was a decent distraction from her life.\nIt was her own fault, really. She’d fucked up. She wasn’t really bitter about it, though, not anymore. She wasn’t exactly miserable. Maybe... Resigned was the right word? It was the closest she had, anyway. With all the mistakes she’d made, with as far back as she’d set herself, this was the bed she now had to lie down in.\nHer father’s voice calling her from the lounge room was a welcome return to mundanity.\n“Lucy, could you go down and find the grill in the basement for me?” \nShe put the feather duster down for the minute, thankful for the reprieve from her thoughts, and joined him in the lounge room. “Sure, dad. What for?”\nHe picked up the phone and started flipping through the old phone book they kept in the lounge room. Lucy had to keep an amused smirk down; he and mom were both so old fashioned. “Charity event next week. Big barbecue at the park. Just want to make sure I’ve got everything ready before then.” \n“Oh, cool. Sure, I’ll find it.”\nShe wondered if he might get her to come along and help again as she made her way to the basement. She liked those charity events he participated in – they gave her something to do. She remembered the first one that he’d asked for her help with, a youth fundraiser of some sort. There’d been a bunch of kids there, and at first she’d thought they’d be nothing but annoying – but the moment they extended an invitation for her to come and join in their game, she was quite certain she’d felt her heart melt. They were precious.\nPrecious enough that the next week, when her mom had suggested she go to community college, she knew exactly what kind of course she wanted to look for. It wasn’t anywhere near as prestigious as Naser becoming a doctor, but at least it was something.\nThe basement light was nowhere near as warm and welcoming as the rest of the house as she opened the door and flicked the switch on. There were piles of random old stuff, bits of ancient furniture, unmarked cardboard boxes stacked high, and close to the front, grandma’s old piano. She’d have to be careful with all this stuff... At least mom and dad had the good sense to leave a little empty space to walk in between the assorted bunk.\nHer gaze lingered on the piano as she made her way down the stairs. She remembered learning to play, sitting in front of that thing. It was the first ever instrument she remembered playing. Almost a shame that it be left to rot down here...\nWith a start she realized that her hand had automatically drifted towards it, intent on opening the lid and... and what? She took a step back. Why did she want to play that thing? She hadn’t played in ages. No, she didn’t want to, not really. No point in playing for yourself, and she had no-one around to play for. Not that she wanted to play for anyone.\nShe’d liked playing music, once. \nBut that was then. A darker time, even darker than the grey area she currently inhabited. She had a new life, now. A good one. Well, good-ish, anyway. She was getting there.\nShe gave the piano one last affectionate rap as she stepped past it, intent on continuing her search – and then promptly stopped dead as she saw something resting against the box behind it.\nHer old guitar – No, not her old guitar. That thing wasn’t hers anymore. It didn’t belong to anyone. It was just a guitar.\nWhere the piano was her first instrument, the guitar had once been her favourite. Seeing it again was an instant reminder of times she’d rather leave behind at this point. It was proof positive that she really had loved her music at one point in her life, no matter how much she didn’t care for it anymore. Or how much she pretended she didn’t care. \nMusic had once been pretty much the centrepiece of her life – she’d connected to people through it, she’d had fun with it. She’d found friends through it, she’d found an anchor to hold onto in it. And then... Trish had led her to believe she could build her life around it. \n‘Hey... I’ve got an idea. Since I play bass, and you play guitar...’\nEven now she couldn’t get her out of her head. Trish had used to be cool. Used to be her best friend, as a matter of fact. Lucy had loved her like a sister. They’d started a little band and everything. It was... still difficult for her to think about. She wasn’t even sure if she wanted to think about it at all anymore. She’d had the worst times of her life in that band... and the best. \nFor all the times she’d thought they were worthless, that they weren’t going to make it, there had been a while she’d really thought they might be going places. That one wonderful concert at Uncle Moe’s, where everything had gone right, and people had seen just what she could really do. She’d felt so nervous when they’d started... that Hitler song she couldn’t even remember the name of anymore. She was surprised she’d ever remembered it, honestly. But it had all turned out fantastic, people had loved them when she’d played guitar. Why had Trish insisted on making her play bass for all that time, again? She didn’t like bass. She’d never been good on bass.\n‘We need a hook! We need something to really stand out!’\nHer face soured as she remembered. Trish had just stopped caring about her, is why. Somehow, at some point, for some reason, the band had become more important to that purple bitch than any of the people in it. All she’d ever cared about was marketability, selling tickets, getting famous... trivial things like ‘Lucy’ and ‘Reed’ and anyone else had just become stepping stones for her to get what she wanted.\n‘It was a small crowd. We gotta think bigger now! I still have stock I gotta sell!’\nWhy hadn’t it just been good enough to just have fun? Had it been Trish who’d started wanting to take the band to the big leagues, or had it been her? She couldn’t remember. She remembered she’d just grown to love passing every other lunchtime with band practice, happily shooting the shit with Trish and Reed. Making music together. Showing each other dumb shit on their phones, complaining about their assignments together. \nAfter that one good concert, things had started to look up. Trish had seemed to be softening up to Anon, accepting him as a part of their little friend group. Lucy had been happy to have a new friend – and then, something a little more. \nTrish, however, turned out not to have appreciated that at all.\n‘I was hoping you were just taking a time-out to cool off and reconsider – What’s happening to you, Fang!?”\nThe auditorium. Trish's voice echoing. Fang. That stupid fucking name. Anon wasn’t there. \nThis was why she hadn’t wanted to start thinking. That itchy feeling was returning to her wings, the insistent little nag that promised relief... if she would only mangle herself. Not beyond recognition or anything. Just a bit. Just a touch.\nShe shook her head, taking an involuntary step back. She wasn’t considering that. She was not considering that. She was seriously not even vaguely entertaining that idea. She’d made a promise – twice in fact, both to Anon and to Naser. She wasn’t going to hurt herself anymore. She had to do better. Doing so well for so long wasn’t enough.\n‘... the songs we wrote, the stories we came up with, all gone? Is that it? And for fucking what!?’\nThe screaming. Right in her face. It wasn’t the band anymore, it was just Trish. She’d taken over. How did she even have the nerve to do half the shit she’d done? What was wrong with that lunatic? What had honestly broken in her head that last year? It was like she’d just flipped a switch and become a completely different person. They’d connected over a love of music, started a band together to share it, but... but what? What happened? She loved music so much she’d stopped loving people? Or she stopped loving music, and started loving money and fame instead?\n‘You told me when the year first started you were scared shitless you weren’t gonna amount to anything in life. Are we in this together or not? If not you’ll dive headfirst into exactly that, you’ll be a nobody!’\nHer hands went up to her wings before she jerked them away. Why couldn’t she get that bitch’s voice out of her head? And why did she have to be fucking right? She couldn’t say it wasn’t true, that was the worst of it. Without the band, she was a nobody. She’d gone nowhere. She’d done nothing.\nShe just wanted to leave those memories behind. She wanted a new life, without the band.\n‘Best friends forever, right Lucy?’\nAnother involuntary jerk as she kept her eyes on that guitar. That bitch. She’d made a promise, too.\n“Fuck you, Trish.” Lucy growled at it vehemently. Nobody in the cluttered, dusty basement answered her, but she didn’t expect them to. That guitar was a vector for her memories, but Trish wasn’t able to hear her through it or anything.\nShe was sorely tempted to just up and smash it, but she didn’t. She couldn’t. It wasn’t her guitar. It didn’t belong to her. It wasn’t hers to break.\nBut, when she thought about it... If it wasn’t her guitar, it wasn’t her problem, either. She could just leave it there. She could be better – She wouldn’t break her promise, no matter how much her old ‘friend’ had. She forced her arms down to her side, away from her wings, and took a deep, steadying breath. Inhale, and exhale. Eyes closed. Focus on herself. Focus on quiet. Inhale. Exhale.\nAt length she finally felt calm enough to turn back to the piles of junk again, and she turned her back on the guitar that belonged to no-one. It would be better if she just left it in the dark. It could stay there for all she cared, where it belonged, alongside all her memories of that time.\nNot her problem. She didn’t need it. She didn’t need any of it.\nShe wondered how many times she’d have to repeat that in her head before it became something she believed. Or rather – something she could forget. That dumb band, that stupid dream had stolen enough of her life already, and the sooner she moved the fuck on away from it, the better. She could still be somebody, even if it was just somebody really small. She deserved to just be happy.\nWhen Anon came back, things would turn right around. Him and her, they could be somebodies together.\n“Hey, Lucy! You found the grill yet?” Her father’s gruff voice from upstairs startled her, recalling her to reality. \n“Not yet, dad!” She hadn’t even been looking, actually. “Give me a second, I’ll find it if it’s here! Are you sure it’s not in the garage?”\nThere was a brief pause before he responded. “I dunno. Might be. You keep looking, I’ll go check in there.”\nShe set about the search again with renewed vigour. She needed the distraction.\nShe did not want to think about VVurm Drama anymore.\n","Title":"VVurm Drama Reflections","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Fang, Ripley","Classification":"One-Off","Rating":"SFW","Author":"Cobalt Blue Sphere","Summary":"Lucy finds nobody's old guitar, lying abandoned down in the basement. Memories of the biggest hit that never actually was come rushing back."}, {"path":["Fang","Ending 3 - Light Inside - Family Dinner.txt"],"text":"As we pulled up out the front of the house, I had to say I felt an odd sense of nostalgia. I didn’t even really know why, because it wasn’t like I hadn’t been here often enough since I’d come back. It felt like before Lucy and I had moved out, I’d spent as much time here as I had at my own place. Nonetheless, my mind leapt back to the times I’d first visited here. Back when I’d walked there instead of driven, on my own instead of with Lucy.\nIt was a nice house, in a nice neighbourhood. Big, two storeys, nice garden. I remember being really impressed by it the first time I saw it – I’d been kind of surprised to learn Lucy had lived somewhere so upscale, but I guess that was partly because I’d gotten too used to my own place being such a dive. I preferred the apartment I had now to either one of them, though. It was more of a home than the both combined.\n“What’s with that look on your face? You look like a reminiscing old geezer or something,” From the other side of the car, Lucy was casting a playfully suspicious glare onto me. “Last time we were here wasn’t that bad, was it? Dad even invited you to go out golfing with him.”\n“No, I know, it’s nothing serious,” I laughed. “I was just remembering the first time I came here. Back in high school,”\nShe gasped in mock horror, shying away from me as much as she could in a seatbelt. “God save me. You actually are turning into a reminiscing old geezer.”\n“We’re like the same age. If I’m old, you’re old,” I jabbed back as I finally turned the car off and climbed out.\nLucy suddenly dropped the act as she considered that for a moment .“Oh yeah, good point. I take it back, you’re not old.”\nI leaned against the car and waited for her as she took a moment to stretch her wings. The sun was just starting to set, but there was still light enough to see the few other cars parked out on the street. The NasCar wasn’t among them, so I could only presume Naser was running late or something. Well, I supposed I couldn’t blame him – he still had a lot on his plate even now. Medical school was no joke, from what he'd said to us.\n“Can’t see Naser’s car anywhere,” Lucy echoed my thoughts as she made her way around the car, extending her hand out to grasp mine. “Hope he’s still coming.”\n“He said he’d be here, so I’m sure he will,” I reassured her as we made our way up the little footpath. “He would have said something, otherwise.”\n“Yeah, you’re probably right. He’s never been a dick like that,” Lucy conceded with a nod.\nShe knocked firmly on the front door as we reached it. From inside I heard Samantha yell out a reply of ‘Coming!’, and then something less distinct to someone else. I could only presume that she was asking her husband to go and get the door for her, and found myself reflexively bracing for an impact that probably wasn’t going to happen. I knew it was dumb, he’d been nothing but nice to me lately, but in my own defense it’s hard to get first impressions out of your head. I’d been more than a bit unnerved by the guy when I’d first met him.\nThe door opened, and to both of our surprise it wasn’t Ripley who greeted us at all, but Naser. \n“Hey, Anon. Hey, Lucy. Been a while,” He said with a warm smile.\n“Hey, Naser. Yeah, it has,” I replied, managing to recover well enough to keep the shock out of my voice. I hadn’t seen him for months now, it felt like, and I found myself a bit disarmed that he was right here in front of me. \n“Naser, hey! You’re here already!” Lucy practically squealed as her wits seemingly returned to her, immediately moving forward to pull him into a hug. “Did you take a cab here or something? Where’s your car? We thought you weren’t here yet,”\n“What? No, my car’s out front,” He pointed out past us, singling out the very car we’d parked behind.\n“Wait, what? What happened to the NasCar?” Lucy asked, turning around to check as he and she separated again. She sounded as taken aback as I was.\nHe shrugged as he stepped aside to let us in, his wing splaying slightly against the wall. The warm glow from the hallway suddenly shone over us without his obstruction. “Eh. Still in the garage, bogged down behind a bunch of stuff we haven’t moved. Naomi thinks I should be driving this one around more anyway,”\n“What? Why?” Lucy sounded scandalized, her feathers bristling slightly as they pulled away again. “I liked the NasCar better,”\nHe just gave us another shrug. “I guess cause it doesn’t have a big old hole in the windshield? I dunno. I wouldn’t stress too much anyway, Lucy, it’s just a car,”\nIt was weird to hear him talking like that about his old car. I hadn’t even realized he wasn’t driving it anymore. He’d been really attached to it, as I remembered. I mean, the name he’d given it had managed to be the cringiest thing I’d ever heard at the time, but he’d said it so proudly. He’d really loved that car... it was kind of a shame to hear that he wasn’t driving it anymore.\nIn spite of that, he seemed pretty at ease as we led the way into the lounge room. His stride was careless and relaxed, blissfully heedless of my thoughts. “So, how have you guys been going? What have you been up to?”\nI sat down on the little sofa together with Lucy as he took a seat on the chair opposite us. “Oh, not too –”\n“THERE YOU TWO ARE! I was starting to think you weren’t coming.”\nI’ll swear I jumped hard enough to graze my head against the roof as Ripley’s voice boomed out from practically right next to me. Somehow my eyes had passed right over him, sitting completely still in his chair. \nMy first detached thought was that it spoke well of my readjustment to civilian life that the thought of reaching for my kabar – which I didn’t even have on me anymore – hadn’t occurred to me at all. For the most part, though, my focus at that moment was stuck on trying to to get my now-rampant heartbeat back under control, and pretending I hadn’t just had the everloving shit scared out of me.\nLucy, on the other hand, didn’t seem to have been affected at all; in fact both her and Naser were sharing a smug little smile.\n“Jesus Christ, were you there the whole time?” I reeled, hand over my chest in an effort to steady myself.\n“I was waiting for that,” Naser snickered, his grin only growing wider.\nRipley let out an uproarious laugh. “Hah ha! Ahhh, you mammal sorts and your movement-based vision. I swear, that never gets old...”\n“That is not nice, dear,” Samantha appeared from the doorway leading into the kitchen to chide him, wooden spoon in hand and her usual pink apron on. I could see an amused smile on her beak in spite of her words as she made her way into the room at a brisk pace and wrapped her daughter up in a tight hug. “Hello, Lucy, Anon. It’s lovely to see you two,”\n“Hey, mom. And hey, dad,” Even as she returned it, Lucy still couldn’t quite keep the laughter out of her voice. “It’s good to see you, too.”\nShe separated from Lucy and immediately headed back towards the kitchen. “Dinner’s not quite ready yet, you two, but it will be soon! Do you want anything to drink?”\n“Not at the moment, thanks. Do you need a hand with anything?” I offered before she left the room. I was composed enough again to remember my manners.\n“No, thank you, I’ve got everything well in hand. It’s been a while since I’ve cooked for this many people, but I’ve still got it!” She yelled out her answer from the kitchen. “It really is such a pity Naomi couldn’t come, though, Naser! Why, this could have been our first dinner together as a whole little family,”\n“Yeah, that’s really a shame,” Lucy muttered under her breath with a roll of her eyes. Thankfully Naser didn’t seem to hear her.\n“So, like I was saying – How have you guys been going?” He asked again. “Been a while since we’ve gotten to talk.”\n“We’ve been going alright. It’s been a... really busy couple of weeks, though,” I answered again, still half expecting something else to scare me out of my wits as I did so. “What about you? You and Naomi still doing alright?”\nPreoccupied as we had been the last month or two, first with the move and then with Trish, we hadn’t had much time to keep up with anyone else. Before the move, I’d talked to Naser a little bit when I’d seen him at Lucy’s place, but never for too long. He’d seemed a bit preoccupied, and more interested to know how Lucy was doing than he was to talk about himself.\n“Yeah, we’re doing pretty good,” He said with a laid-back smile. “We just took out a mortgage on our own place, if you can believe that. Dad helped us find a cheap little house just out of town. We started moving in last week.”\n“Really? That’s great,” I congratulated him with a smile. Maybe I’d had the wrong of it at first. He seemed like he was doing pretty alright for himself after all. He certainly seemed a lot more relaxed now, if nothing else.\n“Wow, Naser! An actual house? You gotta let us come over and see it sometime!” Lucy looked surprised as well for a moment, before her expression shifted into one of guilt. “... I can’t believe this is the first I’m hearing of it. I’m sorry, Naser, I’ve just been really focused on my own –”\n“Hey, don’t worry about it, Lucy,” Naser headed her off with a wave of his hand. I caught how he shot a brief, dubious look my way as he did, though. His tone was as cordial as ever, but I heard questions unasked, masked behind. “I mean, if you guys have been real busy, your stuff’s gotta take priority. But yeah, when things settle down a bit I’d love to have you guys over. At least after we finish unpacking, anyway.”\n“I thought you said you moved in last week? We had our unpacking done in a few days,” I asked.\nHe gave a short laugh and a shake of his head. “You severely underestimate how much stuff Naomi has, Anon.”\n“And how much stuff he has, too,” Ripley chimed in, directing an amused chuckle Naser’s way. “Seriously. Ever since you and Lucy moved out, I’m certain we tripled our floor space. And wall space.”\n“Oh, come on, dad,” Lucy scoffed, gesturing exasperatedly around the lounge room . “Me and Naser kept most of our stuff in our rooms, it’s hardly changed here. Look, you still got everything in exactly the same spots.”\n“Well, yeah, I didn’t say which rooms we gained most of the space in,” He smirked, prompting Lucy to just roll her eyes. His face fell into a slightly more thoughtful expression as the smile faded. “It really has been a lot quieter with you both gone, though...”\n“We can come visit if you want, dad,” Naser suggested. “Like on the weekends or something.”\n“That would be a great idea!” Samantha appeared in the doorway again, her beak open in a wide smile. “Your father’s right, it really has been too quiet here. The both of you ought to give us a call more often! You especially, Lucy. We’ve missed you since you moved,”\n“Sorry, mom,” Lucy said ruefully, rubbing the back of her neck. “I’ll call more often, I promise. It’s just been... really busy,”\n“It’s alright, Lucy, don’t be sorry. Like I said, we just miss you,” Samantha gave her a consoling expression, before she abruptly clapped her hands and beckoned us into the dining room. “But now, come on, you lot! Dinner’s ready, come and sit.”\nWe took our seats around the table as she went back and forth between the dining room and the kitchen, each time bringing back a larger dish and again waving off anyone who offered to help. She seemed to have gone all out – the room was smothered in the heady aroma that can only come from home cooking, on a scale grander that even Lucy could manage. Just about every inch of the table that didn’t already have a plate or bowl on it was soon taken up by a pot of stew, a bowl of sauce, a platter of slow-cooked pork and vegetables. It wasn’t so much a dinner as an outright banquet. Lucy’s cooking made me feel as spoiled as a fat king – but even the king’s chef had no recourse but to quail and bow before the god’s own feast that was now laid out before us. \nI couldn’t deny I was tempted to start in already, but I knew from experience that was a bad idea. I’d seen Naser and Ripley cop stinging slaps to the hand for trying it on meals far less extravagant than this. Even now the both of them were eyeing the food up covetously, but Samantha’s baleful glare kept them at bay. Lucy was usually more restrained, but this time she looked like she was fighting off the temptation as well. \n“Wow, mom... I think you might have cooked a bit too much,” Lucy marvelled. \n“There’s no such thing!” Samantha clucked her tongue at her as she sat down. “And besides, it’s the first time we’re getting to eat together as a family like this, I wanted to make it special.”\n“No it’s not, mom. We’ve had Anon over for dinner tons of times.” Naser remarked bemusedly.\n“Oh, you know what I mean. Even if Naomi couldn’t be here, I couldn’t just un-cook everything,” She huffed, pointing a threatening finger his way. “You’re not too old for a whack around the crest yet, Naser.”\n“You’re never too old for that, as a matter of fact,” Ripley muttered.\nNaser just laughed, sounding completely unphased. “Sorry, mom.” \n“You better be. Now – What are you waiting for? Dig in!”\nThere was an immediate flurry of movement. Lucy didn’t insist on making anyone say grace – I got the feeling she wanted to, but everyone bar her and I already had their plates half full, so she settled for crossing herself before promptly setting about stacking her plate high with everything in reach.\nFor a little while, eating replaced speaking at the table as the dino family I was now a part of tucked in. The food became the centrepiece of what little discussion remained, and the only words uttered were to ask for someone to pass a dish around to them. I could hardly blame them as I finally managed to secure myself a bowl of casserole. It was phenomenal – like nothing I’d ever had growing up. Cooked to perfection, richer than probably anything I’d ever had before. The care and effort Samantha put into her work was on full display.\nI supposed I might be biased, but as good as it was, I still thought Lucy’s cooking was better – maybe only by the barest fraction, but still. Not that I’d ever say that out loud either way. I doubted that Samantha would deem me to be too old for a whack around the ears, either.\nI managed to pack away my share of the meal as we steadily tore our way through it, though I’d admit freely I couldn’t keep up with the voracious appetite of anyone else at the table. I’d grown so used to it, though, I didn’t even notice until Lucy decided to rib me about it.\n“What, Anon, not that hungry? Mom poured her heart and soul into this, you know,” She nudged me with one feathered elbow, a wry grin on her face.\n“Ahh, cut me some slack, I can’t help it if I can’t eat as fast as you,” I rolled my eyes.\n“You haven’t been overfeeding that boy at home, have you, Lucy?” Samantha cast a mock critical eye over her daughter. “He’s right, humans are just like that. You have to go easy on him,”\n“I’ve been careful, mom, don’t worry,” Lucy laughed, shooting me another smug little smile before turning to her mom. “Speaking of which, I was about to ask – this roast, I don’t think we’ve ever had it like this before, have we?”\n“No, I’m trying a recipe from one of my friends out,” Samantha answered happily. “What do you think?”\n“I think it’s f – I think it’s absolutely great,” Lucy caught her slip of the tongue well enough that she only received a playful finger wagging for it. “Can you send me the recipe? I want to make it as well.” \n“Oh, certainly! It’s in one of my binders. I can copy it out for you after dinner, if you want!” Samantha practically glowed. “But you’ll have to help me with the washing up, then.”\nLucy gave her a confused look. “Uh... I could just take a picture of it, mom.”\n“What? A photo just for a recipe? That’s so wasteful –” Samantha’s reproach died halfway through being delivered as Lucy reached into her pocket and displayed her phone. “Oh, right. You kids and your new technology these days...”\n“She’ll still help you with the washing up, though, don’t worry,” I saw my opportunity and I took it, leaning over to jab my own elbow into Lucy’s side this time.\n“He means we’ll help, mom. He’s volunteering himself, too, isn’t that nice?” She glared at me with playfully narrowed eyes.\n“Very nice indeed, dear.”\nEveryone else at the table was watching us with quiet amusement. Ripley said something under his breath that apparently got a laugh out of both Samantha and Naser, but I wasn’t able to hear.\nThe meal progressed steadily, the tremendous feast slowly crumbling under the family’s attentions – and my own less prodigious efforts. Though we hadn’t been around for dinner with them in a while, the atmosphere was exactly the same as ever. With all the turbulence Lucy and I were coming out of from the last few weeks, it was nice to have something that could be relied upon. It was still welcoming here, a place where we were we could be at ease and just relax.\nFinally, though, the dinner came to an unceremonious end as Lucy finished her plate off and didn’t go back for seconds – or another round of seconds, I should say. I’d given the ghost up a while back and was now in the process of fighting off a food coma, and the rest of the family didn’t look like they were doing much better.\nSamantha was the first one to rouse herself, pushing away from the table and using her wings to steady herself as she stood up and turned towards the kitchen. “Alright... Someone stack the plates and bowls up, please. Come on, Lucy. Let’s start washing up.”\n“Sure thing, mom. Come on, Anon,” Lucy stood up slowly, grabbing me by the arm as she did and hauling me up as well with surprising strength.\n“Actually – Just you, Lucy, please. I want to talk to you.”\nShe stopped abruptly, leaving me awkwardly hanging somewhere between sitting and standing as she exchanged a glance with her mom. “What about?”\nSamantha just shrugged. “About girl stuff. Come on,” \nShe tilted her head insistently towards the kitchen, and with a shrug, Lucy seemed to decide to go along with it. She pushed me back down into my seat with the same force she’d started lifting me out of it, still as casual as you please.\n“Alright, just me, then. Coming, mom.”\nWe three who remained hauled ourselves up out of our seats and retired to the lounge room. Ripley turned the TV on to some news program. A professional-looking yellow raptor with slicked-back hair was busily talking about some bullshit or other, but I’d already tuned it out. There was hardly any good news on the news these days anyway.\n“How are you going with med school, Naser?” I asked over the white noise.\n“Ahhh, I’m still working my way through my bachelor’s, Anon. It’s a long ride,” He chuckled. “It’s hard as hell, and there’s so much to remember, but I’m looking forward to the day I can start actually putting some of what I’ve learned to use. Feels like I’ve just been learning about stuff forever.”\n“How long have you got to go still?”\n“I’m not even halfway through yet,” He said with a lazy shrug. “Another year of college. Four years of medical school, but at least I’ll get to do clinical rotations in the second half. Then after that I gotta find someplace to work.”\n“You say that as though you’ll have any issues there, Naser,” Ripley laughed, shifting backward in his seat. “A boy of your talent? You’ll be getting letters from hospitals across the country begging you to come work for them.”\n“Yeah, thanks, dad. We’ll see,” He said with humble smile. “I’d like to stay close to home, if I could. If I can get a position at the Greater Volcaldera Hospital... that’d be nice. But either way, that’s like seven or so years off still. I ain’t gonna stress about it yet.”\nI whistled. “God damn. I know it takes ages to become a doctor, but that’s a long-ass time.”\n“Man, you’re telling me?” Naser gave another laugh as he stood up out of his chair. “I’m gonna get something out of my car. Back in a minute.”\nAs he passed me, he cuffed me slightly on the shoulder, tipping his head towards the door surreptitiously just as Samantha had a few minutes prior. The message wasn’t lost on me, and I gave him a tiny nod before he moved on.\nI gave it a few seconds before I stood up and excused myself to follow him. “I’m heading outside for a minute, too. I need to get some air.”\n“Anon.” Damn. A few seconds wasn’t near enough, apparently. Ripley’s voice was suddenly brusque as he addressed me. “I wanted to ask. How have you and Lucy been doing since she moved out?”\n“Well, we’ve been doing alright. Like we said earlier, it’s just been real busy for us both.” His authoritative tone of voice made me unsure if I should be calling him Ripley or ‘sir’ all of a sudden.\nHe nodded slowly, his expression somehow as much patient and understanding as it was firm and demanding. I got the distinct feeling that I was being judged, but the jury was still out. “You been treating her right?”\nI let out a short exhale. “... I’ve been doing my best for her. I’m not sure how much of it is my place to say, but the last few weeks have been a bit... tumultuous for us both. We, ah... We met an old friend from high school.”\nHis brow furrowed. “It wasn’t that pink raptor weirdo, was it? What was his name again...?”\n“No, that was Reed. We... bumped into Trish.” In a manner of speaking. “I don’t know how well you know her...”\n“Ah, yeah. I remember her,” A flash of recognition lit his face up before it fell back down into a focused look. “Hm. Now I think about it, I don’t remember seeing much of her after Lucy left high school... She just stopped talking about her all of a sudden.”\n“Yeah, she and Lucy didn’t exactly part on the best of terms...”\n“And did she do something? When you saw her?” He asked in a deadly serious tone, leaning forward in his chair slightly. “I’d chalked it up to the stress of moving, but Lucy’s been a bit distant lately. Did Trish do something to her?”\n“No, she actually didn’t,” I said quickly. Jesus, he sounded like he was ready to go up after her now if I’d given him half a reason. “I’m... really not sure how much I should say, Ripley. It was kind of personal. But... It went better than I might have thought. They made up and all,”\nA look of mild surprise overtook him for a second as he slowly sat back again. “Ah. Well, that’s good to hear. Still... Keep an eye on her, won’t you? Keep an eye on them both. I don’t want anything happening to my little Lucy, alright?”\n“Of course I will. I don’t want anything happening to her, either,” I answered firmly. “She’s tough, though. She can handle herself, too.”\n“I know. I just worry about her. For a while, it felt like we were... losing her,” A rare smile suddenly broke through on his face. “You know, you’re almost a completely different man to the kid who first stepped in this house, Anon. I never would have pegged you for it back then, but... I honestly think you are the best fit for my Lucy. You’re a good man, Anon, and... I’m glad she met you.”\nFor a moment, I was stunned out of a response. That was the last thing I’d come into this house expecting to hear tonight. “I... Thank you,”\nHe waved me away. “Don’t tell anyone I said that, of course.”\n“Of course.” I couldn’t quite keep a smile down. Man had to save face.\n“We really should go golfing sometime, Anon. Next time you’re around, we can sort something out. What do you say?” He’d made the offer before, but this time there wasn’t even the slightest undercurrent of an implied threat, joking or not. \n“... Sure, that sounds good. I don’t have my own clubs or anything, though. And you’ll probably kick my ass,” I agreed. I’d never really golfed before, but hell, it might actually be fun if I didn’t have to worry about one of those clubs coming down over my head at any point.\n“You can borrow mine, son. And don’t worry, I’ll teach you. Golf isn’t too hard to pick up, you’ll see.” \n“Alright, sure. Sounds good then.”\nHe gave me a crisp nod as I turned to leave the room and followed Naser out of the house.\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nThe cool wind was the first thing I felt as I opened the door, an immediate shift from the warm, cozy home. Night had well and truly fallen on Volcaldera bluffs, the only light now coming from the occasional streetlamp and the front light above me.\nNaser was sitting quietly on the front step, appearing at ease. He turned and looked up at me as I clicked the door shut again. “There you are. You get lost on the way out or something?” \n“No, Ripley just wanted to talk to me for a minute.” I said.\nHe looked slightly concerned. “... Okay, what’s the damage?”\n“What?”\n“I know dad. When he wants to ‘talk’ to someone, shit gets real.” He explained, looking me up and down as though inspecting me for injuries. “So what’s the damage? Nothing that needs a doctor, right? I’m not qualified to practice yet.”\n“What? No, it was fine,” I laughed. “He actually really just wanted to talk for a minute. It wasn’t anything bad. He invited me to go golfing with him.”\nNaser’s eyes opened wide with skepticism. “...And he didn’t mean it like he’s going to beat you to death with a golf club or anything?” \n“He’s never actually done that to anyone, has he?” I asked doubtfully.\n“Well, no. Not as far as I know. But I mean, he probably would if he was pushed...” Naser said, visibly nervous as he considered the prospect.\n“Yeah, I get that impression off him sometimes...” I sat down next to him on the stoop. “But no. I mean actual golf. He said he’d teach me.”\nNaser was silent for a second. “Huh. He must really like you.”\n“You think so? It’s just golf.”\n“He takes his golf pretty seriously, you know. So yeah, if he’s happy to spend time teaching you, I’d say so,” He sat back slightly, flicking his wings out behind him as he looked up at the black sky. \nI spent a minute thinking about that as I looked out at the empty street. It was a nice thought to consider, honestly. I’d been terrified of the grizzled old ptero when I’d first met him. To think that he’d warmed up to me made me feel like I’d finally properly earned a place in this family.\nMy eyes fell on Naser’s car as I slowly swept them down the street, and I had to wonder again why he’d sprung for a new car.\n“You mind if I ask you something, Naser?” He nodded a quiet affirmative. “Why’d you ditch the NasCar? I liked that thing.”\n“I haven’t ditched it, Anon. Like I said, it’s still in the garage,” He shrugged. “Dragging it out isn’t exactly the highest on my list of priorities right now, though. Once we get everything else sorted out I’ll probably drive it around more. Naomi thinks it should be repaired before I take it out anywhere, anyway... She’s kind of right, I guess.”\n“You think so? I like it how it is,”\n“What, with the big old bullet hole in the driver’s side windshield?” He asked incredulously.\n“Yeah. Gives it charm.” I answered without a moment’s hesitation. “Is it definitely a bullet hole, then?”\n“Probably. Dad won’t say, but I’m pretty sure it is,” He shrugged. “Anyway, at the end of the day, it really is just a car, Anon. A great car, but just a car. I’m not gonna throw it away if that’s what you’re worried about. I might get it refurbished at some point, get the windshield fixed up, but it’s not ending up in the bin even if Naomi doesn’t like it. It’s still a good car.”\n“That’s good to hear,” I smiled. “How come Naomi’s not here, anyway?”\n“Too busy, she says. Tons of paperwork,” Naser heaved a sigh. “She’s a secretary at this accounting firm now, I don’t know if I’ve told you. She’s always busy now, I swear... I don’t know if she just takes her job too seriously or what, but it makes me miss high school. I thought we’d have less work after we left, but we’ve just got even more.”\n“Damn, man. That’s rough,” I said consolingly. I didn’t envy the poor bastard, but I had no idea what I’d do in his shoes. “I hope she can chill out or something. Spend some more time with you.”\n“Yeah, thanks man. Me too,” He said with a short nod. “But anyway. I brought you out here because I wanted to ask you something.”\n“I gathered that. You want to ask how Lucy’s going, right?”\nHe drew back a bit in surprise. “Yeah, actually. How’d you know?”\n“Wild guess.” That and his dad had asked me exactly that already, not even five minutes ago. “It’s not entirely my place to say, Naser. You should ask her. But she’s doing alright.”\nHe was silent for a moment, inspecting me for any trace of dishonesty before he turned his gaze back out to the street again. “I’d just worried she was starting to... I dunno. Relapse a bit, when she didn’t call after she moved out. But you’re right, I will.”\nI didn’t have to ask what he meant by that. Lucy herself had told me the state she’d been in while I was gone, but she was a lot stronger now than she was then. “You shouldn’t worry so much before you at least ask her. It’s not like in high school, I don’t think she’d push you away now if you asked.”\n“... Yeah, I know. I suppose you’re right. I’ve just always worried about her. Even when she didn’t want me to, even when I probably shouldn’t have,” He said with another light sigh. “But I have noticed she’s seemed a lot better since you came back. You know, this’ll sound dumb, Anon, but... I probably wouldn’t be where I am now if it weren’t for you,”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Well, this course. Medical school. I don’t know if I’d have the, uh... fortitude, I guess, for it. I remember back in high school, I was worried as shit about Lucy all the time, it was hard to focus on class. I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown sometimes, no lie.”\n“It sounds rough, but... I don’t get what you mean about me.”\n“Look – this course is stressful enough as it is. If I still had to worry about Lucy on top of it, I probably would have gone postal by now.” He gave a weak chuckle as he looked out onto the darkened street. “I just wouldn’t be able to do it, man. I mean, for a little while after you left, I was still kinda worried for her. But she covered a lot of ground while you were gone, made up with mom and dad and all, and since you came back... she really does seem like she’s going to be okay, you know? It’s been a long time since I’ve seen her as happy as she is now.”\n“Well, it’s not just me you have to thank for that. She’s tougher than everyone thinks, you know. She’s tougher than even she thinks sometimes.” I pointed out gently.\n“Yeah, I know... Still, I was a bit nervous when she said you and her were getting married. You’re a good guy, Anon, of course you are, but I felt like – well, I still kind of do feel like you and her are rushing into it all a bit.” He shot me a sharp look, but it softened as fast again as he heaved a sigh. “... I get that it’s too late to say that now, though. What I’ll say instead is... You better not break her heart, man. Not that I think you will, but you still better not.”\n“Don’t worry. I won’t.” I said firmly. “Lucy means more to me than anything else in the world at this point.”\n“Good.”\nThe door clicked open, and we both looked back to see Lucy herself emerging from the house. She gave us a soft smile as she shut the door again. “Hey. What are you two doing, sitting out here in the cold?”\n“Just talking,” Naser and I said almost simultaneously.\n“Could be doing that in front of the heater, you guys,” She laughed.\n“Yeah, well... You know.” Naser shrugged. Cool as a cucumber. “Look, Lucy... I wanted to ask, have you been doing alright lately?”\n“What? Yeah, Naser, I’m fine. Why’s everyone keep asking me that? First mom, now you,” She nudged me with her foot as she spoke, and I scooched over to make room for her on the step.\n“I just got a bit worried when mom said you hadn’t called for a while, was all,” He said, slightly defensively. “Just wanted to make sure you’re okay.”\n“Oh, well... Well, yeah, I’m doing fine, Naser. Better than fine, actually – I’m doing pretty good. It just really has been... you know. A busy few weeks.” \nShe didn’t quite meet his gaze as he spoke. Instead she turned to me, flicking me a meaningful look. I supposed she didn’t want to tell him about how she’d met up with Trish quite yet. Of her family, I could understand why he’d be the last person she’d want to tell. He’d known Trish the most, and even if he didn’t hate her, my first guess would be to say that he liked her the least. \n“Well, look. We’ll all help if you need anything, Lucy,” Naser said solemnly. I nodded in affirmation – I’d promised as much to her already. “Don’t feel like you’re alone, okay?”\n“I appreciate it, Naser, but I’ve got to do some things on my own, you know? I can’t come to you guys for everything, every time I need help,” Lucy replied with a sigh. “It’s not that I don’t appreciate you guys or that I don’t love you or anything, it’s just... I don’t want to be a burden to you guys anymore.”\n“You’re not –”\n“I have been,” She insisted. “I have. Don’t say I haven’t. I have been, but I won’t anymore. I’m glad I’ve got you guys, I really am – but I’ve got to prove I can do it. To myself, if nobody else.”\n“Alright...” Naser relented, uncertain reluctance tinging his tone. “... You’re still going to come visit them, though, right?”\n“Yeah, of course. Mom was right, I haven’t visited or even called as much as I should. I’m going to do better,” She said confidently. “Just as long as you keep Naomi out of my face, if you’re going to bring her along when you come.”\nNaser shook his head exasperatedly. “I don’t get why you hate her so much, Lucy. She’s been really good to me, and she likes you too. She’s never said a single bad word about you, you know.”\n“Has she ever actually said a word about me at all?” Lucy asked dubiously.\n“Yeah. Every time I told her Anon came to visit, before you two got married, she’d ask me how you both were going. She always seemed pretty happy when I told her you were doing fine,” He explained. “It’d be easier if you got along with her, if we’re going to be a family. I wish you’d give her a chance.”\n“I... I just...” Lucy floundered for a second and fell silent. “... You’re really going to marry her?”\n“I’m thinking about it,” He said after a pause. “I’m honestly considering it. She really has been good to me, Lucy.”\nJust like Trish, I’d never really liked Naomi much back at Volcano High. I remember coming up with nickname after nickname for her back then. I couldn’t deny that she’d helped me out a lot, though, and I was grateful for it – even if she’d very obviously only ever done it for her own sake, help was help. \nShe was often sickeningly sweet, to the point that it came across as nothing more than a facade for a nasty person to wear – But honestly, she’d never wronged me or Lucy. I supposed it would be wrong to judge her without giving her a chance, really – I hadn’t seen her much since I’d come back. She might have changed. \n“She might not be that bad, Lucy,” I said with a little nudge.\n“Oh, alright, alright,” She huffed. “I’m sorry, Naser. It’s just she... I dunno. She never really seemed like my type of person. She just kind of annoyed me, but I’ll try and... I’ll be nice, okay? I’ll make it work.”\n“Thank you, Lucy. That’s all I’m asking for,”” Naser tipped his head. “That actually reminds me. What about your parents, Anon? We ever going to meet your folks?”\n“... Probably not, at this point. Dad doesn’t seem to want much to do with me now I’m out of his hair,” I shrugged. It came out a bit blunt, but it was better to just say it straight, I thought. I didn’t want them to think it was a big deal, when I’d mostly gotten over it. “He never rang me once after school, or when I came back, not even when I told him about how I was getting married. He’s got my number if he ever wants to talk to me, but I doubt it.”\nIt wasn’t really something that affected me anymore. Maybe it was sad to say, but I felt more wanted as a part of Lucy’s family than I had in my own. It was easier to be happy here than it ever had been with my own mom and dad. I didn’t feel like I had to do something to try and fit in here, I just did. I was in a good place, with a good family, and good friends.\nIf my own family wanted to make the push to be a part of that, I’d give them a shot. But I doubted it. I’d given them an invitation already, and they hadn’t taken it.\nLucy was looking away unhappily. She’d asked me about this before, before the wedding, and I’d said pretty much the same thing back then. Naser, meanwhile, was fixing me with a look that told me he had no idea what to say, his beak hanging partway open as he visibly tried to process it. I wasn’t sure what more I could say to assuage him. \n“Look, don’t worry about it,” I tried to reassure him anyway. “Ball’s in their court, is what I’m getting at. If they want to meet you guys, then they will. I’m not going to push them, though, because that wouldn’t end well.”\n“And – What, you’re happy with that?” Naser asked disbelievingly. \n“Not completely,” I answered honestly. “But it’s the best I can do under the circumstances. I am happy here.”\n“Well, that’s... Something, I guess,” He looked away, shaking his head. “Man. I don’t know what I’d do if my mom and dad were like that.”\nI remembered a time where he’d told me that Ripley and Samantha had both just about given up on Lucy completely, but I didn’t open my mouth to remind him of it. Unlike in their case, my own parents probably couldn’t be made to come around.\n“It doesn’t matter overly much, Naser. I wouldn’t worry about it,” I shrugged. “If they don’t want to, they don’t want to. If they do, I’m here.”\n“I hope they do,” Lucy said quietly. “I’d like to meet them at least.”\n“Me too,” Naser agreed.\nI leaned back and looked at the black sky above. “Maybe one day.”\n","Title":"Light Inside - Family Dinner","Status":"Complete","Characters":"Anon, Fang, Naser, Ripley, Samantha","Classification":"Series","Rating":"SFW","Author":"Cobalt Blue Sphere","Summary":"First and second of three suggested oneshot scenes, taking place after the main story.\nLucy and Anon are invited back to her old house for a nice little family meal."}, {"path":["Fang","Ending 3 - Light Inside - School Gathering.txt"],"text":"“Alright, Stella. We’ll see you then,” I said.\n“I won’t be late!” Stella’s voice came through into my ear ringing with overexcited glee. “I’m gonna ring Rosa up and tell her right now! Bye, Anon!”\n“See you.”\nI hung up and dropped my phone down onto the coffee table in front of me, sitting back into the couch for a brief moment. Organizing a date and time that worked for everyone was a bit more of a hassle than I would have liked, but it wasn’t like it was the first event I’d planned now. We’d settled eventually on a simple Saturday evening dinner out at Moe’s – maybe not the most high-class of venues, but we all knew the place. It had history with all of us to some extent, and it was a reputable joint in its own right. The pizza there was damn good even after Moe’s retirement.\n“How’d it go?” I heard Lucy ask from the apartment kitchen, calling out over the sounds of sizzling meat and the plastic scraping of her spatula. \n“All good. Stella said she and Rosa would be there, no surprises,” I replied as I stood up and made my way over to join her. “Trish managed to get any word out of Reed yet?”\n“I haven’t called her yet,” Lucy shrugged. “I was going to after dinner. Or, actually – could you ring her and put it on speaker for me? My phone’s on the table, I think.”\nI tapped her password in and scrolled through her contacts list to find Trish’s number. It had become kind of familiar to see by now, since that first time she’d called me. I placed it on speaker as I made the call and set the phone down on the table.\nTrish answered before the third ring, her voice coming through with enthusiasm. “Heyyy, Lucy! How are you?”\n“Hey, Trish. It’s Anon,” I greeted her cordially. It was an odd thing to describe, but hearing her so happy to talk to Lucy made me oddly happy as well. It reminded me that I could trust her, I suppose. “Lucy’s here too, though, you’re on speaker.”\n“Oh. Hey, Anon.” Trish said again. “What’s that noise in the background? Sounds like bad static.” \n“Hey, Trish. I’m cooking dinner. It’s stir-fry, can’t step away from the stove,” Lucy answered, turning away from her cooking slightly but not pausing her stirring.\n“Oh, shit! Stir-fry? Please tell me you’re ringing to invite me over.” Trish’s voice was suddenly filled with eager hope.\n“Uh – Well, no, actually. It’s not vegetarian, sorry Trish,” Lucy laughed. “I could show you how to make one if you want to come over tomorrow or something, though! Stir-fries aren’t too hard.”\n“Aw, your cooking’s so good though...” I could practically see her purple face falling even from this end of the phone. “What did you ring for, then?”\n“Just wanted to let you know we’ve got Stella and Rosa on board for Saturday,” I replied.\n“Have you had a chance to talk to Reed? Is he going to be there, too?” Lucy chimed in.\n“Yeah, I rang him up earlier today. He said he’d be there, no problem,” Trish gave an airy affirmation. “That reminds me, Lucy, I forgot to ask last time we were on the phone. Did you want me to give you his number so you guys can talk?”\n“No, no need. I was going to ask him when we see him on Saturday. I’d rather catch up in person,” Lucy said gently. “It’s... been a pretty long time. I’d rather talk face to face, you know?”\n“Oh yeah, true. Alright,” Trish sounded a little taken aback for a moment, as though she simply hadn’t considered that possibility. Her voice fell off for a moment, before she audibly rallied herself to keep going with a deep intake of breath. “Alright. Hey, Listen, Lucy, I wanted to ask you... I’ve still got my old bass laying around, and I wanted to ask if you’d like to bring your guitar along and... maybe we could play something together. What do you think?”\nFor a moment Lucy didn’t respond. With her facing away from me, looking down at the frypan, it was hard to tell what she was thinking. Internally I was glad that Trish had had the good sense to ask beforehand this time and give Lucy time to think, instead of trying to spring it as a ‘surprise’. I found myself hoping she would say yes – if for no other reason than that I simply loved to hear her playing, but I wouldn’t deny that I found myself hoping she’d want to play for an audience again as well. Even if it was only an audience of a few.\n“... I wouldn’t mind, Trish, sure.” Lucy answered slowly, nodding her head to herself with ramping confidence. “Do you think they’d actually let us, though?” \n“I don’t see why not if we kept it quiet, we could just say we wanted to play for our friends, right?” Trish was picking up steam now, her voice full of eagerness again. “We’d have to practice something together. Is there anything you’d want to play?”\n“I don’t know off the top of my head,” She shrugged. “It’d have to be something simple. This Saturday doesn’t leave us a lot of room to practice even if you come over every day.”\n“Maybe something from Vvurm Drama?” Trish suggested enthusiastically. “I still got like the tabs and stuff from our old songs! Wouldn’t be exactly the same without Reed on drums, but I dunno if they’d let us get away with bringing a drum kit in as well.”\n“Maybe not, Trish... That kind of music might be a bit loud for a restaurant...” Lucy responded with a note of trepidation.\n“Oh... You think so? We played it there once before,” As fast as it came, all the hot air blew out of Trish’s voice. \n“Yeah, but we’re not gonna get away with that this time if we’re not holding a concert there, Trish. Especially with Uncle Moe gone,” She explained. “And besides, I don’t really remember them that well, and... I think we should just do something easier. Something we can practice pretty quick and just have fun with it, right?”\n“Yeah, you’re right. Alright...” Trish said, just a tiny amount of reluctance audible in her answer. “But what, then?”\n“I don’t know off the top of my head. Do you want to come around after work tomorrow and we can figure something out?”\n“Sure, sounds like a plan,” Trish agreed. “Alright, then, I’m gonna take off. I was just about to drive home when you guys called. Call you tomorrow, okay Lucy?”\n“Sure! See you, Trish!” Lucy said happily as she returned her attention to her cooking.\n“See you, Trish.” I echoed as I hung up the phone and stood up.\nLucy shot me a smile as I approached her. “Hm. Me and Trish, playing together again. I’d wondered if she’d want to,”\nI sidled up beside her as she tossed the stir-fry around in its pan. “I’m looking forward to hearing it. You gonna be Fang again, just for the night, huh?” I was just ribbing her, but behind the joke I was at least a little serious.\nLucy met my eye nervously for a moment, before she looked back down with an embarrassed smile. “... thought I told you not to call me that, Anon. Do I have to dig up some cringy old nickname from your past to call you?”\n“Sure, that’d make it fair. You could just go with the obvious, I guess. Naruto or something, why not?” I suggested for her with a chuckle.\n“You’re not supposed to help coming up with your own nickname!” She laughed, pushing me away with mock exasperation. She stopped stirring for a moment afterward, her face turning up in introspection. “... Fang again, though... I don’t know, Anon. If I was going to, I wouldn’t be exactly the same. I’d want to be... a bit better than Fang. Like... the best of Fang. You know? If that doesn’t sound too dumb.”\nShe turned her gaze to me slowly, as if to quietly gauge my reaction. In response I moved back in and pulled her into a warm hug as she resumed her stirring. “I’d love to see it, Lucy.”\nWe stayed together for a few moments, her head resting lightly on my shoulders before she stood up straight and nudged me away a bit. “Gotta keep stirring, Anon.”\n“Okay. You still don’t mind Sweet Tooth though, right? Just checking.” I asked.\nShe let out an amused little laugh. “If my hands weren’t busy right now, I’d whack you around the head.” \n“I thought that’s what they made wings for.” I pointed up to the feathery appendages in question.\nAgain Lucy’s head shot up, this time in sudden and sharp realization. Her amber eyes fell upon me, alight with the arcane depths of eldritch knowledge I’d apparently imparted. A smile that spoke of wicked mischief spread across her face, and suddenly I had a very bad feeling about what I’d said.\nI flinched away as I felt a feathery slap against the back of my head. “Ow!”\nShe snickered playfully and turned back to the frypan. “You’re really smart sometimes, Anon.”\n“Thanks, I think,” I said as I rubbed the back of my head, trying not to show her my dumb little smile. I’d really invited that one on myself. \n“You’re welcome,” She beamed. “Just about ready, by the way, Anon. Gonna plate up in a few minutes.”\n“Alright, sweet. I’ll go and ring Naomi and Naser and let them know as well before then.”\n“Do we really have to invite Naomi –” She started up in earnest, but then cut herself off with a guilty sigh and a dismissive wave. “... Forget I even started saying that. Wouldn’t be fair if we didn’t, I know. Just do me a favour and make sure that Naser’s coming as well? Maybe he can keep her wrangled a bit,”\n“He should be, but I’ll make sure.”\nShe gave another short little laugh as I left the kitchen and picked my phone back up off the table. I wasn’t sure how exactly much she was joking with that, but she had promised Naser she’d give Naomi a real shot, so I was certain that was what precisely she would do.\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nEvery evening after work that week, the apartment was filled with sounds almost reminiscent of band practice in the auditorium as Trish came over to practice music – and cooking – with Lucy. I made it a point to stay out of the kitchen while they were working on dinner, as it was already pretty crowded with just two people, but from what I heard while doing my own work Lucy was quite competent as a teacher. She put in a sizeable effort to get Trish involved, never making her sit and watch. She had a real knack for teaching, just like I’d surmised back when I first returned to Volcaldera, but whether she realized just how good she was at it was another matter.\nShe seemed a bit less willing to take the lead after the dishes were washed and they’d turned to their guitar and bass, however. As a matter of fact the first evening they spent at it ended up being half practice and half jam session, as they chopped and changed between trying to pick a song they knew and trying to make something up off the cuff. Trish seemed a lot more amenable to Lucy’s input than she had been back then, at least. I’d half expected her to push again for them to do a VVurm Drama song, but she didn’t so much as bring it up. I offered a few choice suggestions of my favourite old boomer rock, but those were pretty summarily passed over.\nJust like those lunchtimes back then, I ended up mostly sitting aside and weighing in when called upon to provide my opinion. It gave me an odd kind of nostalgic rush, even though it somehow didn’t really feel like it had been long enough since then that it would count for nostalgia. As they finally settled on a simple little song and started rehearsing in earnest, all they were missing was the sound of Reed’s drumming and his occasional barely-there quips.\nTrish had visited our apartment a bunch of times before, but always with the palpable veneer of politeness that seemed non-negotiable when you’re visiting someone else’s home. The constant visits quickly eroded that, however, and she seemed to became much more relaxed. That week she turned out to be much more personable company than I would have ever thought possible of her back in high school. It made me wonder if this hadn’t been what she was like when Lucy was friends with her, before the year I met her. Seeing her like this, it wasn’t such a stretch to believe that she was someone Lucy had once been friends with more than half her life.\nWhen Saturday finally rolled around, Lucy and I made sure to leave half an hour earlier than we needed to, just in case there had been any sort of issues with the booking we needed to sort out. I offered to carry Lucy’s guitar case in for her as we found a spot in the closest carpark – which wasn’t actually that close given the joint was in the middle of Little Troodon – but she waved me off with a smile, insisting she had it well in hand. To our surprise, as we made our way there, we found somebody already waiting for us out the front. A familiar pink raptor was leaning on the building’s ornamental railing, maybe a little taller, a little tidied up and a little better dressed, but still very much recognizable as Reed.\nHe gave us a lazy half-salute as we approached, appearing at ease but still seeming slightly hesitant, as though he was uncertain of what he should actually say. “Hey, uh... Hey guys. Hey, Lucy, Anon. How’re you guys doing? S’been a while, hasn’t it?”\n“Hey Reed. It really has,” Lucy said, her voice warm, as though the last time she saw him was just yesterday. “I’ve been doing alright, though. A bit better each day, you know?”\n“Hell yeah man, that’s the way you want it going,” Reed smiled and shot her his trademark finger guns, visibly emboldened by Lucy’s reception. He turned to me with a casual nod. “Hey, Anon. Jeez, man, you hulked out these last few years, huh?”\n“Army life tends to do that to you, Reed,” I grinned as I held out a hand for him to shake.\n“Army?” His eyebrows shot up abruptly and he blinked blankly a few times even as he pulled himself off the railing to take my proffered hand. I got the feeling he was holding back something he wanted to say, probably about the government or capitalism or something. “... Huh. Damn, man, wouldn’t have seen that coming. Must’ve been rough... Looks like you made it back in one piece at least, though.”\n“Funny, Trish said pretty much the same thing,” I chuckled. Seemed like he hadn’t changed much at all – a rock standing against the waves of time. A lanky, pink, spaced-out rock, but a rock nonetheless. “How’ve you been going? What have you been doing all this time?”\n“Ohhh, man, you wouldn’t believe it,” He said eagerly. “When we got out of school I had the greatest idea, right? I thought what I’d do was, right – I’d open up a medical carfentanyl dispensary! It was a bit rough starting out, but it’s going great now. I’m pretty sure I’m like, on track to be the richest raptor in the world at this rate.”\n“A... medical carfe dispensary?” I was unable to keep the surprise out of my voice. I hadn’t realized that was the kind of thing that would ever... well, actually exist. “I guess that’s using the old noodle. I didn’t even know it had medical applications.”\n“Oh yeah man, like you wouldn’t believe. There’s all kinds of stuff you can apply it to if you treat it right. Headaches, tension, torsion, stress – it all melts away like warm water, man!” He beamed happily. His normally placid tone was now somewhere between excited enthusiast sharing his craft and amateur salesman making his pitch. Odd as hell but I think it might have been the single funniest thing I’d heard from him. “People all over are starting to learn about the medical – and mental – benefits of carfe! I’m even working on an extra-mild mix for humans, like you. Hey, you should come and like, guinea pig for me some time, man. I know you’re good for feedback.”\n“Uh – Maybe sometime, sure,” Or maybe not. I was pretty sure it was either him or Trish who’d first told me it would melt my skin right off, and I’d only heard the same sorts of things again while I was deployed.\n“Hell yeah man, it’ll be awesome,” Another flash of the old finger guns as he turned back to Lucy. “What about you, Lucy? What’ve you been up to?”\n“Well, I got my associates’ degree, and I got a job teaching pre-school,” Lucy smiled. “And here, look –”\nShe showed him her hand with our wedding ring on it. Unlike with Trish, I didn’t have to show him my ring as well for him to get the picture. His face lit up almost immediately.\n“Oh, yeah! Man, Trish told me you guys got hitched!” Ah, that explained it. “Cool! Congratulations, guys! I kinda always thought you guys would make a cool couple.”\n“Thank you, Reed,” Lucy smiled. “But... Other than that, nothing as exciting as you, I’m afraid.”\n“Well, getting married’s pretty exciting, isn’t it?” He said. He quirked one eyebrow and cracked a wicked smile. “Any kids on the way yet?”\nAt first I couldn’t muster up much more than a cough at the unexpected question as I shared a glance with Lucy. “Well, we – haven’t really thought about it,”\n“Haven’t really thought about it,” She concurred at almost the same time, shooting me an embarrassed smile. “... Not ruling anything out just yet though, I don’t think,”\n“Hey, I’m just ribbing you guys,” Reed chuckled, raising his hands placatingly. “Prob’ly better not to rush into anything anyhow. Anyway, you guys seen much of Trish lately?”\n“Every day after work lately, in fact!” Lucy laughed, clearly relieved at the change in topic. She brought her guitar case up to show him. “Me and her were going to play something after we eat, if people don’t mind.”\n“Oh, yeah, she was telling me about that on the phone too,” He said knowledgeably. “I thought about bringing my old drumkit, but I didn’t think they would let me get away with that. I’m glad you guys are all talking again, though. She was... pretty miserable for a while. That last year at school... There was a few months I think I was like the only person she talked to. I tried to play, like, counsellor for her, as much as I could. But she wouldn’t stop beating herself up over it all.”\n“Yeah, it...” Lucy’s gaze fell down to the ground. “... hasn’t been a good few years for any of us, I suppose. What she did... I know she didn’t mean it all like that now, but it still hurt, Reed. Back then I couldn’t take it.” \n“I know...” He shook his head regretfully. “I’m sorry, man. I shoulda done something more to try and talk some sense into her, but I thought... Well, I dunno what I thought. I thought she’d cool down and think it through, I guess. I thought she’d –”\n“Hey, it’s alright, Reed. It’s all in the past,” Lucy interrupted him with a reassuring tap on the shoulder. She looked back to me for a moment with a smile. “Just dumb teenagers making dumb teenager mistakes. We’re moving past it now. That’s what’s important.”\n“I... True. I guess so,” He seemed taken aback for a moment, but his face settled back into his relaxed smile quickly enough. “No sense dwelling on it now, I guess.”\nA lull fell over the conversation, dampening down the heavier turn it had taken. In its absence I finally noticed the chill of the early evening air as a spike of cold down my spine. I drew Reed and Lucy’s attention with a gesture to the door. \n“You two want to go inside? We still gotta check the reservation, Lucy.”\n“You’re right,” She agreed. “Come on, Reed, let’s head in. We need to make sure everything’s sorted before everyone gets here.”\n“Hell yeah, let’s get some grub,” He followed along behind us enthusiastically. “I got the munchies, man.”\n“You’re not planning on filling up on entrees before everyone even gets here, are you?” I asked skeptically.\n“Dunno. Only one way to find out,” He grinned.\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nIt was roughly half an hour – as well as several platters of breadsticks, primarily dumpstered by Reed – later that the first of the invitees started to arrive. Naser and Naomi walked in through the door hand in hand, sporting a sharp blue jacket and dress that had clearly been handpicked to match each other. That could only have been Naomi’s work – even her glasses matched, starry blue rims sparkling in the restaurant’s warm orange light.\nNaser pointed us out, and Naomi immediately gave an enthusiastic wave and wide, clearly-practiced smile.\n“Hello, everyone! Are we still waiting on people?” She hadn’t even made it halfway to our table before she enthusiastically launched into her usual shtick, still leading Naser by the hand as she weaved her way over to us. I had to try hard not to tune her out, and next to me Lucy was visibly struggling with the same task. “Goodness, this is a lovely little place, isn’t it? A little bit quaint but it’s got a charm all its own, doesn’t it, Naser?”\n“Yep. Place has history,” Naser replied mildly, somehow managing to sound like a paragon of patience in the face of such relentlessness. He gave us a cordial nod as he approached. “Hey Lucy, Anon. Evening, uh... Reed, wasn’t it?”\n“Yeah man, that’s me. How you going?” Reed stood up and reached out a hand to Naser.\n“Not too bad, thanks.” Naser smiled as the pair of them shook.\nBefore Reed could so much as withdraw his arm after, Naomi darted forward to take his hand in both her own, smiling like a pompous old dame to go along with her over-enthusiastic shake. “Hello Reed, it’s so nice to see you out of that silly old mascot suit! I still can’t believe you wanted to wear that ridiculous thing to graduation as well as prom.” \n“Wha – Hey, I liked that costume –” Reed started to protest, but Naomi had already changed tack and turned away.\n“And it’s lovely to see you as well, Lucy and Anon! I’m so sorry I couldn’t make it to your mom’s big family dinner the other week. Do you know if she’d want to do another one soon? I’ve just been so busy, but I really want to get to know your family better!”\n“I – I don’t know, I’d have to ask her,” Lucy barely managed to field the rapid fire question as Naomi dragged Naser over and sat down next to her. Her expression was alike to someone drinking poison, telling me she dearly wanted to ask to switch seats or something, but she didn’t. Instead, she mustered herself up and put a smile on her face as she addressed Naomi on her terms. “It’s, uh – it’s nice to see you too, Naomi. Your, um... Your dress looks really pretty!”\n“Oh, thank you! I picked it out just to go with my dear Naser’s lovely jacket!” Naomi said happily, apparently able to switch between gushing and fretting and back again on a dime, and pleased as punch that Lucy was engaging with her. “I’d usually rather go for something red, but they just matched so perfectly that I had to take it.”\n“I kept trying to say we didn’t need anything so fancy just for dinner at Moe’s, but she insisted,” Naser said, rubbing the back of his neck abashedly. \n“Well, it’s a special night. It’s not every day you see people from high school again. Got to have the perfect thing to wear for an occasion like this!” She said with a saccharine smile. \n“I guess so,” Naser chuckled. “I mean, I won’t say it’s not a really nice jacket.”\nNaomi beamed him another little smile before turning away. Her eyes swept the table again, and landed on a certain pink raptor currently lazing back in his chair. Behind her pretty glasses, an almost auditorial look fell upon her face. “So, Reed... It’s been ages since I’ve seen you last. How are you keeping yourself busy these days?”\n“Man, I’ve been running my very own small business!” He answered proudly. Naomi actually looked impressed for a second, until Reed opened his mouth again. “A medical carfe dispensary, if you can believe that!”\nHer face fell perfectly flat for a comical moment as she visibly tried to gauge if he was being serious or not. “Oh, I... I see! That sounds like it’d be very interesting!”\n“Mmm-hmm. Never a dull day on the job for me, man.”\nI barely managed to hear Naomi lean in towards Naser and whisper quietly. “Is that actually legal?”\n“Course it is, bro, I’m fully licensed and certified and all that and everything!” Reed answered her perfectly conversationally. Apparently he’d managed to hear her, but hadn’t managed to notice she wasn’t actually talking to him. “Pretty impressive, right?”\n“I know I’m impressed.” I interjected.\n“Well... Yes, it’s certainly impressive,” Naomi conceded with a smile. “Running a business of your own is no mean feat after all.”\n“Right? All the paperwork and stuff,” Reed threw his arms out exasperatedly. “It’s like they never run out of bills you gotta pay or things you gotta look at. Whatever happened to good old capitalism just being good old capitalism?”\n“Uh...” Naomi visibly struggled to parse that for a moment.\n“Like, I just want to keep the place running. Just let me deal with the people and quit giving me extra stuff to do, you know what I mean?”\n“I know I do,” A new voice butted in. We all looked up to see Trish hanging just on the edge of the conversation, her usual confident little smile on her face. “Sick to death of regulations and... OHS and stuff. Like they think I don’t know what I’m doing, like they think they could do it better.”\n“Right?” Reed didn’t miss a beat, as if he’d expected her to be there at exactly that moment. “Big fat wastes of time.”\n“How long have you been there?” I asked.\n“About ten seconds-ish.” Trish gave a casual shrug and found herself a seat at the table. “Evening, everyone. How we all going?”\nA round of return greetings followed before Naomi kept going. “Hello, Trish. Nice to see you again. Are you and Reed running your business together?”\n“What? Nah, I’ve got my own thing. I’m running a salon,” Trish answered, her tone carefully casual with her old enemy number one.\n“A salon!?” Naomi squealed. Should have seen that coming, a salon was just her kind of thing. “Oh goodness, that’s amazing! Where at? I’d love to come see what you do sometime!”\nTrish seemed hesitant to talk to Naomi at first, but by degrees she picked up steam, and soon the conversation turned to Trish happily regaling Naomi with stories of customers she’d had. I tried to tune myself out of it. On the one hand it was intriguing, the two people I would have thought least likely to ever find common ground chatting away to each other. But on the other hand, they were still just talking about hairdressing and nail polish. Or horn polish as it were. \n “There was this one spinosaurus guy last week, came in wanting just a trim and a shave, you know that sort. Had mud in his hair. Like not just a bit of dirt, actual dried up mud. Told him he didn’t need a trim, he needed a fucking bath –”\n“Really? That’s disgusting! Who goes to get their hair done like that? Some people, just some people –”\nI leaned over and nudged Lucy’s arm as I whispered. “Look at ‘em go. They’re like a house on fire.”\n“God, how much people change,” She snickered. “If you’d told me back then I’d ever see Trish and Naomi sitting at the same table and not stabbing each other...”\n“Well, you could have said the same to me about you and Naomi and I’d have been just as shocked,” I pointed out with a nudge.\nLucy gave a little embarrassed laugh. “Hah. True.”\n“What are you two talking about?” Naomi asked us, head tilted curiously. Next to her, Trish had a suspcious glare on her face, like she knew exactly what we were saying.\n“Oh, nothing. So, Naser said you’ve been real busy at work lately, Naomi,” Lucy deflected effortlessly.\n“Oh, absolutely! I’m always busy, so much to do, so little time to do it,” Naomi responded as exuberantly as ever. “It’s a wonderful job, though, I love working there. The people are so friendly! Paycheck’s very nice, too. And there’s still room for advancement!”\n“What do you do, exactly?”\n“I’m a secretary at Hornberg & Hornberg’s Accounting!” She said with a proud smile. “Mostly I organize appointments, handle clients and field phone calls. With how much business the firm sees, there’s so much to do, but I keep on top of it!”\n“Wow, that sounds like a lot. It must get tiring doing so much every day. Uh, have you... ever thought of looking for something easier? You sound like Trish, overworking the hell out of herself,” Lucy remarked gently. Both Naomi and Trish shot her a dubious look in response.\n“Not at all. Like I said, it’s really a wonderful job. I wouldn’t dream of quitting,” Naomi wrung out another smile, only a little more strained than the last. “It’s a bit exhausting sometimes, but that’s to be expected at such a prestigious business. It’s still a wonderful place to work.”\n“Hola, amigos! Everyone!” A boisterous voice I hadn’t heard in years surprised us. Lucy and I looked up to see Rosa waving eagerly as she weaved between tables. Unlike everyone else I knew from Volcano High, she looked as though she’d not changed tack one whit. A familiar smile graced the orange scales of her more-matronly-than-ever face. “It’s so wonderful to see you all again! It’s been so long!”\nStella was following along slightly behind her, bringing up the rear with somewhat less aplomb. “Hello, everyone...”\nNaomi jumped up out of her chair to greet them, enthusiastic air already returned to her. “Stella! Rosa! It’s been ages since – Hgkh!”\nSwept up as she suddenly was in a massive hug, Naomi’s sentence quickly turned into nothing more than an undignified squawk. Rosa, however, seemed not to even register her discomfort. “Naomi, I’m so happy to see you well! How have you been? I have not forgotten how hard you advocated for our gardens as council president!”\n“Can’t breathe – let go!” Naomi managed to wheeze as she struggled.\nEventually Naomi managed to extract herself from Rosa’s embrace, gasping for breath. The amusing situation was almost enough to bring a smile to my face – Almost. But I knew that I would be next.\n“I was glad to hear I would be seeing you tonight!” Rosa beamed. “You look like you have been doing quite well! What have you been doing since we left high school?”\n“Yes, I’m doing great,” Naomi coughed out as she sat herself back down, looking slightly shellshocked. “It’s wonderful to see you too, Rosa. M-Maybe I could just catch my breath first before I tell you, though...”\nStella took a seat next to Trish, giving her a timid little wave. Rosa, meanwhile, was busily scanning our party for familiar faces. In my gut, I knew what was coming, and I recognized it was my turn to be put through the wringer. Deciding it would be better to just get it over with, I steeled myself and stood up from my seat. Rosa took notice immediately, her head snapping to face me in a way that reminded me uncannily of predator locating prey.\n“An-on! Gracious me, you are tall now!” She was on me in mere moments, a terrifying strength brought to bear like an avalanche against a tree. “Why did you just disappear like you did? Stella and I both missed you!”\nI took a deep breath as I braced for impact, and she hit me as would a wave breaking on stone. The massive force of her squeezing hug threatened to pop me open like a blood sausage.\n“Sorry Rosa – Been deployed –” I managed to force out, barely audible over the sound of my ribcage presumably creaking inward. I wasn’t pretty invincible after all, as it turned out.\nShe let me go in short order, leaving me to suck in a deep breath as I staggered back a step. Without giving me a moment’s respite she darted forward again and grabbed my chin in one hand, holding me in place as she fixed me with a death glare to rival the time I’d trampled those flowerbeds. The years sure hadn’t done anything to dull her demeanour.\n“Still such a foolish boy. Making such a silly decision... The army. The army! You might not have come back, did you not think of that?” She groused as she released me at last, glowering and shaking her head. “I am just glad you made it home safely.”\n“Me too, Rosa, don’t worry about that,” I assured her as I gave myself a once over. Nope, nothing broken. Raptor Jesus be praised. “I made a promise that I’d come back. I wouldn’t break it.”\n“It might not have been up to you, An-on, and you know it,” She chided me with a piercing look.\n“It’s okay, Rosa,” Lucy chimed in as she rose from her chair. “He made it home okay, just like he said he would. We’re all here now, that’s what matters.”\n“Lucy! Ohhh, I’m so glad to see you! We missed you as well!” Rosa seemed to simply flip a switch, suddenly gushing happily again as she raced over towards her. “Stella told me you would be here, I was looking forward to seeing you! How have you been?”\n“Well, I’ve –” Lucy had barely even begun her sentence before she realized what Rosa’s open-armed approach meant for her. Her eyes widened and her pupils practically disappeared as she shrank back. “No – Wait – Please don’t –”\nBut there was no stopping the tremendous ankylosaur once she’d gotten started. It was too late too stop, too late by far.\nNo hope remained for Lucy. No salvation. No mercy.\n“Please!”\n\n\n-\n\n\nLucy was still rubbing her ribs and muttering under her breath half an hour later. Granted I kind of was too, but it was still funny.\nThe night progressed quickly enough. The food arrived, drinks were ordered and downed, and stories were swapped. The atmosphere at the table was quiet and mellow, conversations striking up and splitting apart with a relaxed air, blending in easily with the chatter of the restaurant at large. It was nice to be able to catch up with everyone like this at last – I’d been curious to hear where life had taken the old cereal box mascot crowd, and they seemed just as interested to catch up with each other. \nTrish and Lucy were chatting away cordially as they usually did. Again I was struck by how quickly and how firmly they had rekindled their friendship. \n“Did you watch the Brachidashians the other night?” Trish asked, between even bites of her vegetarian pizza. Notably, she wasn’t pigging out anywhere near as hard as she did with Lucy’s home cooking.\n“What? No, we were practicing guitar, you were there with me last night. Also, really? You actually watch that?” Lucy laughed. “I was watching the new Allonborough documentary last week, though,”\nA little bit apart from them, Stella and Naomi were making their own polite small talk.\n“Stella, I heard you’re working at Volcano High now. How are the gardens doing nowadays?” Naomi asked as she worked her way through her vegan pasta, prim and proper as always.\n“They’re as lovely as ever! They won another award last year, you know, even without Rosa there!” Stella answered happily. “I hardly get time to visit them, though... Oh well, at least I can stroll through as I’m coming in and out of work.” \nOn the other side of the table, Reed and Naser had struck up a lively conversation of their own.\n“Yo, I should get you on as like, a consultant or something. That’d look good on the ads. ‘Certified by Dr. Naser’, man that sounds cool...” Reed chattered excitedly.\n“I’m still not gonna be licensed for years yet but sure, why not,” Naser replied evenly, between bites of the Meateor Special he and Lucy were splitting. Well, I say splitting, but in reality she was swiping most of it. “What would I be consulting on exactly, anyway?”\nRosa, meanwhile, was oddly quiet, happily listening to Stella and Naomi talk about school. Just as I looked her way, she turned and caught my eye, a measured look on her face.\n“An-on. How has life been treating you?”\n“Since I got back home? It’s been great,” I smiled. “Being able to see Lucy again was the best moment of my life.” \n“And before that?” She quirked an eyebrow. “Stella says it is only recently you came back.”\n“Well, before that was service. Just... something I had to get through. I’m sure you can guess it wasn’t exactly a fun ride.” I shrugged. “I mean, I’m not gonna say it was all bad all the time, but still...”\n“Do you have any stories you might like to tell then, An-on?” She asked curiously.\nI considered it for a moment. Some of the guys in my squad had been pretty alright, humans and dinos alike. For all the shit – all the discomfort, the stress, the fear – there had still been some times I remembered fondly. Moments where I could just forget the shit I was in and laugh for a little bit, moments that had been so vividly reminiscent of school I’d almost thought that’s where I was again. Like we were just a bunch of retards casually hanging out after class, instead of a bunch of retards out of their depth in the middle of a warzone.\nLucy caught my eye as I sorted through my thoughts, concern written on her face, and stepped up to cover for me. “Uh... I don’t know if that kind of thing is exactly something for a dinner table,” \n“No, I got something. It wasn’t all fighting, you know,” I said slowly. I appreciated her willingness to bat for me, but I had one I could tell. “It’s not real exciting, but there was this one time one of the supply trucks coming to base flipped over into a sewer drainage ditch. Guy was okay, it was just an accident, but everything in the truck ended up in the drink. Some of it could be salvaged – glad I didn’t have to do that, I’ll say that much – but some of it...”\n“What was it?” Naser asked suddenly, to my surprise. I hadn’t even realized he was listening. “Top secret government army stuff? That’d be embarrassing to have fall in sewer water.”\n“Nah, just really basic stuff.” I chuckled. “Ammo, utensils, cleaning supplies, that kind of stuff. And... toilet paper.”\nThe table seemed to have quieted down a little bit. People were half talking, half listening now.\n“Anyway, not a terribly big deal. The supply’s mostly written off, everything keeps going. People started getting stingy about toiletries and stuff and rationed the toilet paper so it’d last till next resupply. Next supply truck comes around, and... no paper. Now I bet you can see where this is going to go,”\n“Not sure I want to,” Lucy looked both amused and disgusted, a sentiment shared by the rest of the table listening.\n“It pretty much all went to shit, no pun intended. They tried to requisition more from other depots but it was all gonna take too long to arrive. Some people got the word out and tried to get people to smuggle it in. Other guys traded stuff with people in the nearby village just to have any paper at all while other people, uh... didn’t even bother.” \n“Disgusting!” Rosa cringed away, eyes scrunched shut. “An-on, tell me you did not...”\n“No, no, I didn’t. There were a couple guys I know actually stole some from the base’s store, and hid it in little stashes so they could have some no matter what... And then they started selling it. Well – I say selling, but it was more like highway robbery. Or extortion.” I sighed. “I didn’t have a choice, though. I had to.”\n“Ouch. How much they charge, man?” Reed asked, tone somewhere between sympathetic and professionally curious.\n“Five bucks for a roll. Ten bucks. Twenty bucks. Fifty. Whatever they thought they could sting you for,” I shook my head. “People started hating them before long. Started stealing it off them and selling it back at even crazier prices. There were almost like... little TP cartels formed over it, all over the base. If it’d gone on any longer it would have probably turned into a whole little civil war. Over toilet paper.”\n“Over toilet paper?” Both Lucy and Rosa asked disbelievingly.\n“Over toilet paper.” I confirmed.\n“God, you almost make it sound like it was just a bunch of kids on a camping trip like that,” Lucy laughed. Rosa echoed her sentiment with an incredulous shake of her head.\nI guess I kind of did, when I thought about it. It obviously wasn’t, but if you’d only heard that story, you might think it was. It was the first time I’d actually told it to anyone – not even Lucy had heard it before. To be honest with myself, I don’t even know why I did, except that I guess I felt an obligation to entertain since I was the one who’d invited everyone there. I’d thought it would hurt more to revisit any of those memories, even happy ones, but... it hadn’t, really. \nI shook my head gently as I realized that. Maybe I’d moved past it better than I thought I had. \nSeemed like Lucy and Trish weren’t the only ones able to get themselves scared of nothing. \n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nAs everyone finished their food and the night started to wind down, Lucy and Trish finally decided the time was right to make their move. \n“Hey, everyone? You remember that little band me, Trish and Reed made in high school?” She stood herself up out of her chair and picked up her guitar case from where she’d stashed it near our table.\nTrish followed suit, grabbing her bass out of its case with enthusiasm. “Me and Lucy wanted to play something for you guys. Just if you want to listen,”\n“Play Wonderwall!” Reed hollered.\nTrish turned to reprehend him immediately. “Shut up Reed, that song sucks. It’s always sucked.” \n“I like it. I’ll play it afterwards, Reed,” Lucy piped up, a little grin on her face.\n“If you play Wonderwall, I’ll kill either myself or everyone else in this building. Or both.” Trish declared, pointing her fingers warningly first at her own eyes then at Lucy’s.\n“Alright, alright, sorry Trish,” Lucy laughed, before looking back out at everyone with a keen smile. “Anyway, we’ve been practicing together all week. It’s nothing crazy, but we think it sounds nice. Anyone want to hear it?”\n“Yeah, I do,” Naser answered first, his interest visibly piqued. “I never got to go to that big concert you guys did at Moe’s.”\nThe rest of our motley crew joined him in a chorus of affirmatives, an air of interested curiosity taking over the table. Conversations died out completely as Trish and Lucy hefted their instruments and stood together near their seats.\nThe two of them shared a reassuring look and a nod. Lucy closed her eyes and started strumming. The first few bars were soft and slow, her tail gently wagging and her head bobbing along in time.\nEvery time I saw her playing again, my heart swelled. Gone was the reluctance to so much as sit in front of a piano, replaced with the proud happiness that had used to shine through on her face when she’d bared her soul to the world. She made no pretense now that the music wasn’t a part of her, the song a solemn admission that there was a part of her that she yet yearned to show the world. \nTrish kicked in with her bass, a steady undercurrent that drove the pace of their song, and together she and Lucy sang. They spoke no words, only hummed in concert to carry over their instruments, adding their voices to the music. Trish’s carefully modulated singing backed up Lucy’s choir-like tone, the pair of them working in unison again as though they’d simply never stopped. I doubted that anybody who listened to them could have ever guessed the friction that had been between them before. \nDespite that I knew it as something they’d hashed together in a week, it felt like a complete song in its own right. Without a doubt it was a change from VVurm Drama’s old repertoire, but all the more appealing even so. Everyone else at the table was listening raptly, almost entranced by the music. I had to wonder how Reed’s drums might have fit in. I looked over to see him nodding along with the beat of the song, clearly imagining the same thing himself with an appreciative little smile on his face. \nAt length they finished with a flourish, and raised their eyes up from their instruments in unison. This time I didn’t have to lead anyone in a round of applause; it was given almost immediately, with even a few people from neighbouring tables joining in. None of us had even noticed them listening, but with the song finished we could now hear the quiet that had fallen around us while Trish and Lucy played. \n“That was really lovely!” Naomi cheered. “Now I really wish I could have heard your band play back in school!”\n“They didn’t play this kind of stuff back then. This was way better, though!” Stella pointed out as she clapped. I saw Lucy cringe slightly at the reminder.\n“Hey, thanks, everyone. Glad you liked it,” She put on a smile nonetheless and waved her gratitude to both her expected and unexpected audiences with a sheepish smile.\n“Man, that was great. I gotta get back to practicing drums, I want to play with you guys again now,” Reed said, almost envious in tone. “So what’d you call it? That song?”\n“Uhh... Haven’t really thought of a name, to be honest,” Lucy glanced over at Trish, who just shrugged in response. “It was just something we played.”\n“What!? Every song needs a good name,” Reed gasped, as though grand sacrilege had just been committed before his eyes. “Man. You guys are like, lost without me.”\nLucy just shook her head bemusedly as she and Trish put their instruments away. Just as she was about to click the case shut, though, she suddenly looked up at me, a pensive expression on her face. There was a note of indecision in her eyes, as though she was debating with herself on whether she wanted to say something or not. \nFinally she seemed to make a call, hesitantly bringing her gaze back up to the table. “Actually... I got another little thing I wanted to play for you guys. Me and Anon wrote it together, back in high school. You want to hear it?”\nA half a dozen voices cried out another round of affirmatives, and Lucy suddenly had to visibly try to keep her eagerness contained at the response. With a cool composure as she grabbed her guitar up again and stood straight before the little crowd. She plucked at the strings carefully for a few moments before nodding, seemingly satisfied with her measurements.\nShe drew in a fortifying breath as she looked up to face us again. “Alright. I hope you guys like it,” \nThe familiar melancholy melody filled the air as Lucy started strumming gently, even slower than before. In absence of Trish’s bass backing her up she played a touch louder to ensure the song kept its weight, each note reverberating through the area around us. It worked – as before, everyone at the table was listening raptly.\nI had to admit that without Trish’s bass, the music almost felt... less like a complete song than when they had played together. I supposed it made sense – there just wasn’t as much to listen to. But in truth it wasn’t just a song. It wasn’t something that had been constructed formulaically to be measured scientifically, it was a story told from the bottom of her heart. \nNobody could deny the soul on display before them, channelled into the music for all to hear, in spite of its comparative quiet. Lucy spoke silently of turmoil endured and hardships survived – survived, and ultimately overcome – and everyone we’d known back then heard it now. I don’t know if they necessarily understood, but they heard it. Heads downcast and brows furrowed in thought, or eyes wide open as outpoured emotion flowed over them, they heard it now.\nIf not for the motions of her arms, Lucy might have been mistaken for a stone-still statue, caught in her memories as she played on our collective heartstrings. It was the first time she’d shared that song with anyone else. Only she and I had ever heard it before. Some small, unreasonable part of me wanted to be jealous that it was no longer a secret we shared, but I quashed that thought vehemently. \nIt was still as beautiful as ever, and something as beautiful as that deserved to be heard, deserved to be witnessed by the world. Lucy – and her music – deserved an audience. \nEven if only a small one.\nThe song finished, and the last note faded away. Lucy looked up, her smile somewhat faint as she anxiously awaited the table’s responses.\n“I don’t know much about music, Lucy. I dunno how to say how that one made me feel,” Naser said, his voice barely above a whisper. “But that sounded beautiful.”\nA current of quiet agreement ran around the table. Lucy murmured a heartfelt ‘thank you’ and turned away to grab her guitar case, hiding her vulnerable smile. Once again my heart felt too big for my chest. She’d been so afraid once before, but here she stood embracing all she’d once turned away from.\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nWhen Naser and Naomi decided to say goodnight and drive home, that basically marked the end of it. Rosa decided it was time for her to leave shortly afterward, and Stella had to follow her ride home. The rest of us decided to call it as well, and Lucy and I went off to settle the bill as the rest of the motley old crew meandered off outside.\nI hardly even wanted to speak of the absurd number on the account as we left the restaurant to join them. “If we do this again, next time, everyone’s paying for their own food.”\nLucy, seeming slightly shellshocked herself, only nodded as we made our way out into the cold evening air. The dark of the onsetting night was only broken by the pale streetlights and the few other establishments still open around the plaza.\nStella and Rosa were still hanging around, quietly conversing with Trish. Reed, meanwhile, was waiting alone some distance away. He caught sight of us and immediately waved us over, looking unfittingly somber.\n“Hey. Trish just said she wanted a moment to talk to those guys,” He explained quietly.\n“What about?” I asked, glancing curiously over at them. Now that I looked, Trish seemed to be acting oddly meek, presenting an even smaller figure than usual with her head downcast.\n“... Said she wanted to say sorry,” Reed grimaced with a quick look towards Lucy.\n“For what?”\n“For prom, I imagine,” Lucy said, the tiniest mote of grim bitterness in her voice. It was dispelled just as fast as it came with a sigh, however. “For getting them involved.” \n“Yeah, I... Man, I really should say sorry, too,” Reed said, nerves now audibly entering his voice. “Not for prom, but for like... All that shit she did, to both you guys, it wasn’t her fault. Not entirely, anyway. I went along with it all when I shouldn’t have ‘cause I didn’t realize how hung up on it she was getting, but just... She didn’t mean to, you know?”\n“Reed, like I said before – it’s alright. I know. I don’t blame Trish anymore.” Lucy said simply, with a pensive shake of her head.\n“Oh.” Reed dropped his gaze to the floor. “Do you, like... Do you blame me, then?”\n“What? No,” She looked at him strangely. “Of course not.”\nNow he just looked confused. “... Yourself?” \n“No, Reed. I don’t blame anyone.” She said emphatically, waving her hand as though it should have been obvious to him. “There’s no-one to blame. It was just dumb teenagers making dumb teenager mistakes. I only wish I realized it back then, you know? But I can’t blame myself for that, either, because I was just a dumb teenager too.”\nReed almost looked a bit put out, but he seemed to concede the point with a helpless little shrug. “I mean... You're not wrong, I guess. But, like... It feels a bit wrong to say we were all just dumb...” \n“Well, we sort of were. We all did the best we could with what we had back then, but we still just were what we were.” I echoed a thought I’d had before.\n“Exactly. No shame in calling it what it was,” Lucy shrugged. “All we can do is show the world that we can do a bit better this time around. It was just mistakes, right? Not the end of the world, unless we let it be.”\nAgain his expression became one of consternation for a moment as he looked away, rubbing the back of his head. “I... guess so. I still just wish I’d done a bit better, you know?”\n“I think we all do,” I commiserated. “But we made it here alright. Sometimes that’s all you can ask for.”\n“That last year at school could have gone a lot better,” Lucy admitted. “But it could have gone a lot worse, too. I’m still getting used to some things a little bit now, and I’m still making some mistakes, but nothing as bad as before. And I’ve learned a lot since then.” \n“Like what?” Reed asked curiously.\n“Well, I know... I know who I am now, do you know what I mean? I got so stupid in my last year at high school because it felt like everything I did just went wrong,” She said quietly. “I thought that meant I was a bad person, I thought I had to be somebody completely different. Who I wanted to be and who I was... just got too far apart from each other. Way too far.”\n“And that’s my fault,” Trish’s morose voice cut in. Without any of us noticing, she and the others had apparently tied up their conversation and come over to join us, Stella and Rosa both following along a bit behind her.\n“No, it’s not, Trish,” Lucy recovered quickly, rebuffing her insistently. “It’s not anybody’s fault. We all did dumb shit, that’s normal when you’re a kid. Sure it’s easy to look back and go ‘Oh I should have done this’ or ‘I wish I’d been smart enough to do that’, but how could any of us have actually known back then? It’s not anybody’s fault that we made dumb, stupid mistakes. It doesn’t need to be anyone’s fault, you know? It’s just something that happens.”\n“I still just feel so bad, Lucy,” Trish said quietly, refusing to look directly at her. “I know you said it doesn’t matter now, but all that shit I did... For years. Years of your life, I was trying to fuck it up...”\n“No, you weren’t. You were trying to help,” Lucy put her hands on Trish’s shoulders, forcing the tiny triceratops to look up at her with watering eyes. “You were hurting, too. I didn’t get that back then, but I get it now. You were just trying to help me, not hurt me, and I should have realized.” \nQuietly I reflected that I probably should have, too. Lucy was pretty much my whole world, then – hell, she still is now. But I’d almost let myself forget that people besides her existed, and had feelings of their own. Trish might have been the biggest bitch I’d known back then, but she’d had reasons to be. That didn’t excuse what she’d done, but it explained it, and that was the kind of thing that could take you from enmity to empathy – if you let it. Bitterness had less room to fester where understanding took root. \nI’d realized that perhaps a bit too late to be happy with. Lucy, even later. But just like she said, we couldn’t go back in time and tell ourselves that. It would sure make life easier if we could, but it just wasn’t something that was going to happen. \nAll of us had done the best we could. Moving on would be something we did for a while, maybe forever, but as long as we kept doing it, I knew we’d be fine.\n“Lucy,” Stella broke the silence that had fallen with an air of timid awkwardness. Trish and Lucy both turned their gaze to her. “Uh, Rosa and I were about to head back home... Do you mind if I get your number? So we can talk again? I’d like to talk to you guys still after this...”\n“Sure,” She fumbled in her dress’s pocket for a moment to find her phone. “We can talk on rockbook too, if you like. Oh yeah – Reed, Rosa, can I get your numbers as well?”\nAfter everyone had swapped numbers, we said our farewells. Rosa sent us off with another round of spine-snapping hugs, while Stella gave a comparatively less confident wave goodbye as she left. Trish gave a heartfelt promise to call tomorrow as she bid us goodnight, and Reed assured us he’d message us both before blazing his trademark finger guns one last time for the night.\nAt last, that left Lucy and I as the only ones remaining. She grabbed her guitar case up with one hand and linked her other up with mine, and we began the long walk back to our car. We walked a lot slower this time compared to when we were arriving, our energy having been thoroughly drained over the hours.\n“Well, that was a pretty nice night, wasn’t it?” Lucy spoke up with a little smile. “I was surprised how much they liked that song Trish and I made, considering we only spent a week on it. I almost missed my notes a few times.”\n“I didn’t even notice,” I said honestly. “I’m not surprised they liked it at all, though. You always play beautifully.”\n“Thank you, Anon,” She murmured. “I still feel a little nervous playing in front of people like that. It’s not quite the same as playing for choir, or a concert.” \n“You did well, though. I’m glad you’re playing again.”\nAnother small, grateful smile graced her face, but her expression took on a look of introspection as she looked away again. “Hey... Do you remember how you said I shouldn’t have stopped playing?”\n“Yeah.” Even now I still remember the surprise I’d felt when I returned, learning she’d just left her music behind.\n “I want to say you were right about that, but... I think I had to. I wasn’t tough enough back then. I couldn’t take it. I needed to get away from it all,” She gave a small sigh and a shrug. “It wasn’t the best time of my life, but it gave me time I needed to get stuff figured out. I’m not Fang. Fang’s not... me. Not me anymore. Fang wasn’t... a good person, really.”\n“I thought she was,” I piped up.\n“I’m talking objectively, here,” Lucy insisted. “Fang wasn’t smart. At all. Fang wasn’t very nice to a lot of people, not even you at first. And Fang wasn’t tough enough to take anything without running to someone for help.”\n“There’s nothing wrong with needing help –” \n “I don’t want to be Fang anymore.” Lucy said firmly. “But... Don’t get me wrong, I’m still happy that I was for a little while, even if I was edgy as hell. I’ll never forget what she – er, they did for me, even if it was mostly on accident. Fang didn’t come from a good place, but they were good in the end. I didn’t get it before, but I get... there were things I should have learned earlier. Things Fang wanted to teach me. You wanted to teach me. About myself. About everyone else.”\n“Like what?” It sounded like she’d given this a lot of thought. I wondered how much time she’d spent pondering on it when she was away in her head.\n“Like that I am good enough. Like that I really can make it work on my own if I just try. I know you’ve tried to tell me that before, but I... I don’t know why it took me so long to get,” She whispered. “And that I’ve got people I can trust. If I’d just had the guts to talk to Trish properly, I’d have realized that. She’s one of them. And obviously you are, and my family, and... me.”\nShe drew in a nervous breath, and I gave her hand a squeeze in an effort to reassure her. She looked up at the black sky for a moment before coming back down to earth.\n “And most importantly... I won’t be Fang, but... I’m gonna try to carry a bit of them with me if I can. Try to be the best of Fang.” She paused for a moment, then gave a quietly amused snort. “Well, that still sounds kinda dumb when I say it out loud. But you get what I mean, right?”\n“I do,” We shared another laugh. “Just like I said before, I’d love to see it, Lucy. That’s certainly a change from calling Fang ‘that thing’ like you did before I left.”\nShe gave a little shrug, and a nod of concession. “Yeah, I suppose it is... Still gonna wingslap you if you keep calling me Fang, though, don’t think I won’t.”\nI laughed along with her as she planted a playful poke into my side. “Is that going to be a thing going forwards now? ‘Wingslaps’?” \n“Why not? Sounds good to me,” She leaned back into my side, still snickering.\nAs we finally reached our little old car I unlocked it quickly, eager to get out of the chill, and Lucy carefully placed her guitar on the backseat before hopping in the passenger seat. For a while we we were both quiet as I drove home.\nIt had been nice to see that the old crowd were all doing well. Most of them I’d seen semi-recently, of course, but I’d not talked to Rosa or Reed in a long time, and it was nice to know they were alright. The night going off without a hitch was everything I’d hoped for; it had shown Lucy and I that everyone was able to put the past behind them. Lucy herself had shown that off especially, happy to not only see people from school again, but to share her music with them... The thought filled me with bolstering confidence that we were, in fact, going to be just fine. \nThankfully, it seemed like that was a feeling that was becoming more and more common in my life lately.\nI pulled my eyes off the road for a moment to glance at Lucy. She was leaning back quietly, eyes half closed, almost appearing asleep, but she caught my gaze with a flick of her own amber eyes.\n“Eyes on the road, Anon. Rather not die in a car accident, thanks,” She chastised me bemusedly. She definitely sounded half-asleep. In fact she sounded as if she could drift off at any moment.\n“Sorry. Was just wondering if you were sleeping,” I laughed.\n“Nah. I’m tired, but not that tired,” She shuffled in her seat slightly. “Was just thinking a bit.”\n“What about?”\n“Ahh, just more dumb-sounding stuff,” She chuckled. “Seeing everyone from back then again like that... just brought some things to mind, is all.”\nGood thing I was never not eager to pick her brain. “Anything you want to share?”\nShe considered it for a moment, seeming to rouse herself up before she started talking. “Well... I’ve been thinking about what might make me happy. For a while – well, maybe more like my whole life, actually – I’ve just been doing what makes other people happy. Trish, mom... even you, kind of. I gotta figure out... me. You know? You make me happy, obviously, but besides you... I think there’s something I want to do myself.”\nI nodded slowly, remembering myself saying something similar a while ago. “What’s that?”\n“I know I say nobody could go back and tell us that we were being stupid, but even so, what if there'd been somebody who had?” She said, the sleep now absent from her voice as she spoke with intent. “I keep thinking like, if only someone had come along and told me and Trish how dumb we were being back then, what would have changed? Everything could have been so much better. As it was, I was lucky you came along when you did, Anon.”\n“I didn’t even do that much, you know...” I shrugged.\n“Yeah, you did, don’t go getting all humble,” Lucy waved a finger at me. “But that’s not what I’m getting at anyway. What I’m saying is... Maybe you’re onto something with that music teacher idea. I mean, as a teacher, maybe I could help kids having the same problems me and Trish did. Maybe it doesn’t need to be as painful for them as it was for us, you know? Just someone being there to say the right thing at the right time... Just like you did for me, Anon. It might make a world of difference to some poor kid some day.”\nI thought about it for a moment. I hadn’t even considered that, back when I’d first suggested it to her. I’d thought only of how proficient she was at both music and teaching, but she was right – that was something that would be right up her alley.\n“That’s a really good idea, Lucy.” I nodded. “Hey, maybe you could replace old Mr. Jingo. God knows he never got around to doing much teaching.”\n“Maybe. We’ll see,” She chuckled quietly. “I’ll say this much, though... If we’re ever parents, Anon, I swear I’m going to make sure my kid never makes the same mistakes I did. Man, I did way too much dumb stuff back then...”\nI wanted to remind her that we all had, but I had the feeling she knew that just as well as me. Reed, Trish, Naomi and Naser – everyone had their own problems. Everyone had been fighting their own battles. Still were, really. That simple phrase I’d once dismissed as nothing more than a dumb epithet from my old principal... I’d learned the truth of it a bit too late, I supposed, to have understood the pain Trish was going through. I’d only seen the pain Lucy was going through, without considering where it came from.\nBut I got it now. I’d gotten there in the end. We all had, in our own ways.\nLucy’s voice jolted me back out of my thoughts, pulling me out of the autopilot I’d settled into. The streetlights illuminating the quiet city night suddenly seemed a little brighter again now I focused.\n“Speaking of, I’ve been meaning to ask you...
