                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: VVURM DRAMA 2nd Impact</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: P.M.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's finances can't keep up between his internet bill and his growing gacha addiction</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Those Ptero JPEGs though, Raptor Jesus on a stick. Well worth splurging his navy stipend</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Months behind on rent, he finally gets kicked out after selling practically everything he owns to delay the inevitable</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Only one thing left for him then, Anon becomes homeless</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Busks for money with a beat up guitar he found in a dumpster</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Gets decently good at it. No-one is going to feed a shit performer with anything but knuckle sandwiches</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One day, some guy sticks around, offers Anon a deal. Join in with his band for guaranteed income</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Band already has a few members. Could just use a 2nd guitar to round out the ensemble</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon agrees, arriving early on the first day of practice</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Some band members are late, so Anon just gets to showing off what he can do with the rest of them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Everything is going well until the final band member comes in</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That voice is sure familiar</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon turns around to see Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She hasn't seen him yet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He grabs the closest thing to him, the unattached bell of a marching band tuba</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He then shoves it over his head, obscuring his face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Band members have no idea what's going on</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There isn't even a tuba player in the band where did that bell come from?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon replies that he plays better when he can't see</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They somehow roll with it. Good thing there's no sheet music for their songs. Anon gets invited to the next practice</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Next time around he just comes in with a paper bag with GUNDAM written on it in permanent marker</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One day is worse than the others</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang can't quite hold it together</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Band leader rips the bag off Anon's paper-bag-face to give to Fang for hyperventilation treatment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No tuba around this time. The band has been especially on watch since the incident where Anon appeared to have pulled one out of thin air</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I mean shit those go for hundreds of dollars. Easy money if one shows up again</div><div class="fanfic-line">>God damnit, Fang is recovering faster than expected</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon sees his only redemption</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One silent prayer to Raptor Jesus later, he pretends to trip and impales his head through a snare drum</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not too bad this time. He can almost see the fuzzy shadows of the band members through the drum skin</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon is disappointed that he won't be able to quote Batdino anymore. His darkness was taken from him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He's made enough money to replace the drum at this point at least</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The band leader isn't too impressed though, but since Anon paid for it, it's his hat now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They just call him Drumstick from then on</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Good thing too, since Anon was vetoing requests for his name and "Skinny" had worn itself thin</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Band is actually doing well now. It's been invited to a good amount of medium profile gigs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's image has been going around pretty well too</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I guess Daft Grunk isn't too bad a moniker</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even got one of the band members to stencil a face onto it while he was wearing it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The acetone-smell hasn't quite vanished from the inside of it though</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He swears he can feel the bassist getting closer to him at every event they play at</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Can't tell for sure though, black stencil is probably not a good idea for visibility</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One day some rhinorex comes in to talk to the band leader</div><div class="fanfic-line">>By the way his shadow is moving, Anon can tell that something big is happening</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He finally comes over to make the announcement</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They've been invited to the big leagues</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stickstock 201M2025 BC</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The event is enormous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon gets lost multiple times, but he can't take off his headpiece</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No way can he afford to let his adoring fans be crushed by just how plain he is</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not to mention the shot of courage that this fleeting form of anonimity gives him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>God damn though, those burgers smell delicious. He only knew of one guy who can eat food through a mask and he lost contact with him ages ago</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One of his band members finally decides to help him navigate</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They're really quiet though, Anon can't tell if his smalltalk is even being answered over the din of all the people and sound equipment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh well. Doesn't matter. He can ask later</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Eventually he finds himself in a nice chair with arm and leg rests, his guitar having been thrown onto his lap moments after sitting down</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One of the band members snidely remarks that the chair is absolutely perfect for Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon can't figure it out though, a chair is a chair right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe it's just nerves. There's a lot of anxious energy floating around as everyone checks their equipment and makes certain that nothing bad can possibly happen</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I mean, you wouldn't want a string on your guitar to snap right before a performance</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The shadow of the rhinorex agent casts over the skin of Anon's drum-hat</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He lets the band know that they'll be on next, and to get everything set up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon suddenly finds himself moving. An automatic-drive chair? Holy shit how expensive is this thing? Must have gotten comped by the sponsors</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He hopes the AI is better than what he remembers of those car autopilots. He seriously doubts the companies claims that it doesn't specifically target skinnies</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His joyride finally ends, as Anon finds himself on what he can only conclude is his spot on stage</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The lights flash on</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon can only be grateful that he cannot see the audience at all thanks to his helmet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He can certainly hear their cheering however. Over and over again they call out the name of the band</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's a bit muffled though. Really should have considered carving some ear-holes. He can't quite make it out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon is surprised at the reception. All those hours lounging away on his favourite lithography carving meet-up didn't show any signs of his band</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I guess it isn't obscure or counterculture enough. Those fuckers. He'd get them later</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon sees a shadow move forward, and a voice cracks through the speakers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"THANK YOU STICKSTOCK! WE GIVE YOU, VVURM DRAMA!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>An amused hum leaves Anon, Fang must have more input on the band than he thought.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's thoughts are quickly interrupted as the band's drummer counts them in</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Speakers call out as the band enters their musical set, the audience responding back with yet more cheering</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Lightning fast fingers go through the motions, Anon's blind practice showing through as he played his parts to perfection</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Take that Rockki Hendrix</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Can't quite lift the guitar behind his back while playing though. Maybe if he ever takes off the drum-helmet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Song after song gets played, the mania of the crowd becoming ever more potent with each passing minute</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If their set was infinite, Anon felt like he could play forever. His aching sweating body being no contest towards the absolute euphoria he was undergoing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But as the last song of their set finished, Anon accepted the inevitable. The crowd's response surely had guaranteed their return to big leagues</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon set his guitar back on his lap, signaling to the audience with devil horns on his pumped out hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But, the cheering died down. What? What's going on?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Isn't the band leader supposed to close them out? Where is he at?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The lights dim a touch, as another shadow comes up to where the microphone stands</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Geeze, about time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A guitar sings out once more, testing chords. Anon surmises that whoever is playing must be really nervous</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ah fuck. The band must have managed to forget about him in their own euphoria before they left the stage. How much time passed? Did someone spike the water?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe he should just play along with these next guys. He did tell himself he wanted to play more didn't he?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon gets his guitar into position once more. All he needs to hear is some chord progression before he jumps in with his own improv</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He follows the lead guitar, call and response, call and response</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Once more, the stage lights blaze on, their spotlights panning toward both the guitar out front and himself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The silhouette of the lead guitar imprints itself onto the drumskin of Anon's helmet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Those wings, time and despair marking them, spanning across the entirety of his vision</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In that moment, Anon can only let his heart and fingers guide him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That song, made together at what seemed a lifetime ago on a roof, tempered by life experiences, sprang forth from the both of them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was this song that Anon believes had saved his life. It was what he played when life was at its lowest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was even what he had been playing that day he was first found and inducted into the band</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But, he never finished the song. Its parts were all in shattered pieces at best</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And yet, when his song sputters out in unknown waters, Fang's guiding harmony is there to stop Anon from drowning</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It grabs a hold on his song, holding it aloft until Anon can once again find his footing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And where Fang's song gasps out in weakness, Anon's resounding chords pump life into it once more</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And so it was. where one guitar falters, the other is there to guide it back</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Nothing else in this moment exists to Anon, only his music and the music woven counterpart to his soul springing forth from the shadow ahead of him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The song hits its climax, the two becoming a singular whole as the uncharted ending exploded out from both of their hearts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Nothing but silence greeted their fading notes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon begins to believe the whole thing is some sort of elaborate prank. Is he playing to a canned audience?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That thought is quickly quashed down, as the sheer wave of exuberance reverberates from the audience</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He didn't even know girls can hit that octave holy shit</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The cascading shadow over his drum-hat brought Anon out of his daze</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wait, is Fang coming towards him?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh fuck</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's too late. Something clamps down on the drum and wrenches it off Anon's head before his hands can possibly secure it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The blinding stage-lights pierce into his eyes, his head dropping down to protect them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wait, this chair</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh fuck this is a wheelchair</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Might be suitable depending on how this turns out I guess.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His vision slowly climbs back up to view what he believes is his goth-grim-reaper</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There she is, standing before him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I knew it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Shock reverberates through Anon, prompting his eyes to finally meet Fang's</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The expression he expects her to be wearing isn't there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In its place, with tearful eyes dripping ruined mascara, beams a glowing smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Come on, they're waiting for us."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang's hand grips onto Anon's forearm, hauling him up from the chair and bringing him center-stage to fully appreciate the adoration coming from the audience</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Despite the growing demand from the audience for a encore, there is only one response to give with such a packed event</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"THANK YOU STICKSTOCK WE LOVE YOU!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As the curtains close on the band, Fang's wings close on Anon, wrapping him up along with her tattooed arms</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The hug is much more subdued than the one Anon remembers from that one fateful gig he helped with before, but no less heartfelt</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They stand together like that for as long as they can, but the world waits for no-one</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fang! Drumstick! Come on! Get your stuff, we gotta go!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They break apart, barely held emotions showing clear on their faces</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Both Fang and Anon grab their equipment, using the wheelchair as a mock-handcart</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Both of them push the wheelchair with a hand, the other entwining with its soul-bound opposite</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang then turns to Anon, "I think a certain dweeb owes me dinner."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon lets out a watery laugh, before replying, "Yeah. I owe you a drumstick don't I?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The jab and resulting light pain to Anon's shoulder was well worth the sounds of Fang's laughter in his opinion</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He can definitely use that to excuse the tears trailing down from his eyes</div>
