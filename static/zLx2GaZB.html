                    <div class="fanfic-line">Pink Fuzz 4</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Final Rondo</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish’s duplex was small, but lively. Reed suspected her mother was a nurse: rarely present and always exhausted. The numerous shelves and bookcases in the living room were lined with rhinestones and assorted fantastic figurines depicting unicorns, goat men, the works… It was the perfect representation of someone coping with a harsh job, someone seeking escape.</div><div class="fanfic-line">As Trish hoisted him through the house, he realized why she worked so hard to find success.</div><div class="fanfic-line">After thanking her mom for the ride, Trish strained and groaned as she hauled the jelly-legged raptor junkie into her garage, where they could be alone for the rebuilding process.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The garage was lined with everything from a workbench, to spare lumber, to spray paint, to a bundle of old tractor tires. You name it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No wonder you always get plans going. That’s like, an Ed, Edd n Eddy thing.” Reed chuckled, but his voice was hoarse after hours of unloading on the counselor, crying, and trying to fight off security guards in bouts of paranoia.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why? You said you were a fairyboy. I thought you were better than this…” Trish replied shakily.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed clenched his teeth with worry. “I- I’ll make it up to you. It’s just been really rough at h-.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I heard. I couldn’t hear enough of it. Anon? You went to his place too? You could’ve come here at any time. Did you even think about that, you fucking idiot?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">He didn’t</div><div class="fanfic-line">“S-sorry, bro,” he squeaked. “I’ll find us another venue to jam out at.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">The glare Trish issued made him shrink back in his dino blankey, nearly mummifying himself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You’re going to play at Dino-Moe’s. I’m going to be your rehab coach. I plotted a regiment with mom and everything,” Trish stated flatly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed’s eye peeked out from the blanket. When did she change into that Tapout sweater, and where did she get that hose from? He thought.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The tiny triceratops flicked a switch and a pressure washer hummed to life. The hose already fed into it. Her gaunt fingers wrapped tightly around the nozzle and twisted until her knuckles went white.</div><div class="fanfic-line">FWSSSHT FWSSHT! She gave an experimental pull on the trigger, and a perfect white beam of water shot out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Don’t worry. It’s low pressure. It won’t leave bruises.” Trish said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">FWWWWSSSHHHT!!</div><div class="fanfic-line">“AW FUCK NOT COOL!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">FWWWWSSSHHHT!!</div><div class="fanfic-line">“TIMEOUTTIMEOUT!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed’s shrieks resounded through the quiet neighborhood that day, and Trish made sure it would stay this way until five days pass, until the concert.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The pink raptor, dressed in nothing but an oversized D.A.R.E. shirt, wheezed and wobbled as he took to the tire run Trish assembled in her backyard. Trish’s mother sat on the porch nearby, filling an ashtray like nobody’s business and reading through a harlequin novel.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Those massive tractor tires became Reed’s first enemy. He already left several face prints against the vinyl fence as his large legs gave out and tripped him over and over again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">His body flashed hot and cold simultaneously. His mind went blank. His jaw hung open as he gaped for air constantly, drooling like an animal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">His foot caught the horrid mouth of a tire again and he collapsed. His fall was cushioned by the obstacle course like an angel’s kiss, and he sprawled his nude body across them. He didn’t give a single shit at this point as his junk hung out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He didn’t flinch this time when Trish blew her whistle. “Ten seconds of rest. Just finish a few more sets and then we move to the strength exercises.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed gasped. His chest heaved up and down. His bruised, battered peach body glowed once again in the daytime sun. A golden silhouette accentuated his body, thanks to the mist from numerous hosings.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed whined and gasped, unable to form words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No backtalk. You’re not going to die. I looked this up.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish’s mother nodded sagely, and watched intently as Trish delivered another perfect beam of water into his exposed tailhole.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“MAXIMALLY UNCOOL! RANCID CUNT FUUUCK!” Reed shrieked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eventually, the noise complaints stopped coming. Reed learned the hard way that whatever horrid, horrid experiments Trish ran were always tolerated by sheer bullheaded triggerity.</div><div class="fanfic-line">This wasn’t all pain for Reed. He was given the finest handmade meals he’d ever had. Wonderous bowls of meat, veggies, and fruit showed themselves to him steamed, grilled, raw; it all tasted great and filled him with a vigor neither his parents or cafeteria food ever gave him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He teared up with joy and scarfed down a bowl of jambalaya.</div><div class="fanfic-line">As usual, Trish stood behind him with a whistle around her neck and the hose in her hand. Even against her purple scales, her eyes were dark and baggy with exhaustion.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, she cracked a smile every now and again. “You look like Inafune when you do that, savoring every meal after a long journey.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You captured my family? Let them die! I hate all of them!” he growled between tearing chunks of steamy chicken and sausage between the sets of daggers he called teeth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He quoted the Musashi film, and elicited a chuckle from Trish, but they both knew he meant this in sincerity as well; in this real world where he’d be aptly branded a deadbeat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Silence washed over them. All the pushups and squats and tire runs really made his scales and feathers glow. His humor seemed to come back as well, but there was a long way to go.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We can’t do this forever, you know? And there’s a pile of homework waiting for you.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hunched over his food like an animal, Reed let bits of fried rice tumble down his muzzle and onto the garage floor. He belched hotly and sighed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I know. Th-thanks for everything, Trish. You’ve been a real bro, and I mean a real one.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">The tire suddenly creaked as Trish sat down next to him. Her plush thigh indented against his toned leg like memory foam.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed’s raw muscles stung like hundreds of hot wires. He bit back a yelp.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish winced from his pain and tried to scoot away to give him space, but Reed’s massive tail, like a palm tree of pink, gently wrapped around her waist, and pulled her closer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s okay. I’ll pull through. I’ll be stronger, for myself and everyone. Even if Fang calls me a… weed.” Reed said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“She said that?” Trish peeped.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, Anon said she said it…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish’s brow furrowed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s okay…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s not that… It’s just, are we losers?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">The pair went silent.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang was always the one with the talent. We’ve just been hurting her. I still think about what you said, even though you exposed our cringe school games to that ape.” Trish said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, I could be wrong.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“If you’re being aloof on purpose I’ll get the hose…” Trish jumped bolt upright, but Reed’s hands wrapped softly, but firmly around her shoulders.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Don’t wash me out like an asylum patient again,” he tried to speak coolly, but clenched with worry.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I just mean… Fang has her own stuff to deal with, and Anon makes her happy. When I see them together they’re glowing, and it’s not the carfe, I swear.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish eased down again, but grounded her bountiful, grape rump onto his lap.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed’s face burned hot. It wasn’t time to be a bro, but a man-saur, and he cradled her back and legs tenderly in his arms.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’ve slung deals with people all across town. I’ve never sold to kids and I don’t sell bunk product. I don’t sell shitty hook drugs either. I think I even sold to the mob at some point.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Everyone, all this time, thought I was just goofing around. I really don’t understand what any of them think of me anymore.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish stared up Reed wordlessly as he chuckled.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Isn’t that fucking crazy? I could’ve been an assassin. Like, a ninja or some sh-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">A loud slap rang through Reed’s skull. Trish delivered a small, but powerful palm print that burned against his gentle, pink scales like a branding iron.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You idiot! You dopey cunt!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Crazy bitch! You controlling little tyrant! I can’t believe I let you-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Mid-shout, Trish slammed her muzzle into his. Her supple lips cushioned against their unwieldy snoots as they crooked their necks until finding the perfect place to interlock.</div><div class="fanfic-line">They moaned hotly into each other’s mouths as Reed worked his strong, raptorian tongue around hers. He gently bounced her on his lap, enjoying every movement. Their hands wrapped greedily around each other, grasping at any chunk of soft meat they could.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed thought they may be mismatched losers in unwieldy positions, but every correction made formed a dance of compensation, an attempt to please the other, but still be embraced.</div><div class="fanfic-line">They found themselves curled around each other, lodged into the tractor tire like coupled snakes. Trish’s claws dug into his back, hips, and firm, peach backside while he tongue-banged her until she gasped.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed’s junk grinded against his t-shirt. His sizable rod tented Mc’Rex (the no drug dude)’s face decal as he thrusted into the warm, all-enveloping force of her thighs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Their passion filled the garage with heat, like a sauna of sweat. Their movements eventually softened, and they lapped each other’s bodies like waves at low tide, rocking in perfect tandem.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed gently licked the ripe, blueberry mounds of Trish’s bare breasts before collapsing on top of her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Awwhn~. I wanna melt across your body like strawberry syrup. S-so hot. Tired. You’re working me to death,” Reed groaned.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish grunted. She tried to push the limp post-stoner off, and wriggled with all her strength, but it only got her aroused again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still basking in the afterglow of the furious makeout, she wasn’t too mad.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Time passed, and before they knew it they rushed through homework sheets while getting a ride from Trish’s mom. Eventually, They got to Moe’s before Fang or Anon. They stumbled occasionally and, thanks to Reed, both adorned massive shades to cover the social black holes surrounding their eyes. However, they laughed lively, and joked about old movies as they worked the wiring arrangements and set up Trish’s makeshift t-shirt stand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed still thought spray painted shirts were cheap, faux-punk garbo, but he didn’t have the heart to say it. He didn’t wanna get gored after surviving the rehab concentration camp…</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon, Fang, Stella, Rosa, and plenty of randos funneled into Dino-Moe’s. The soft, yellow lights of the restaurant played across the soothing latticework, coating everyone with a groovy cross-section pattern. Despite the size of the venue, the place was managed well with few walls between everyone. Reed finally felt he was alive again, and he breathed easy. He was swept into conversation with friends, and in the high of reacquainting with everyone, agreed to watched some show called Chobits.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without carfe, Reed felt the weight of anxiety build throughout the venue as they neared showtime.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Cig break. I’ll be right back, boss.” Reed said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish smiled and shot finger guns at him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang had the same idea, Reed found, and he saw her leaning against the brickwork out back. Her eyes glanced to his. She grinned, and crunched the menthol bead between her teeth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed slapped a fresh package of Raptorian Spirits, making sure the tobacco was freshly packed into the end of each cig.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Burping the babies.” He said jovially, and leaned on the wall beside her. He ripped open the package with a swift pull against his teeth and offered one to the frontliner.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wordlessly, she handed him a menthol.</div><div class="fanfic-line">They shared each other’s flavors, two cigs in each mouth, and watched the sun set over the vast bazaar of Troodon Town.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey, Trish.” Anon said from the backroom, the open window carrying his voice to Reed’s ear. “You sure this outlet’s right? The cables look like a mess.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed suddenly doubted himself. He felt crusty again in a flash that made his lip twitch. The menthol fell out from his maw, but he snatched it back, mid fall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Nice.” Fang said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">For that moment, he remembered the hellworld he lived in only a week ago. No, all up until this point - shithead family included.</div><div class="fanfic-line">His lazy lids and dashing eyelashes swept toward Fang. He popped the cig back in and puffed small rings before smiling.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ey. I don’t think I told you about this, but you and Anon are fuckin’ in-sync.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Also… sorry I almost killed everyone back when,” he added sheepishly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m sorry I said you were a weed.” Fang said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hm?” Reed replied, feigning ignorance, but the grin spreading across his cheeks gave him away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang elbowed him in the side. He hoped the exercise would force her to revel at his hardened abs, but he was still raw from rigorous daily training, and his muscles didn’t have a chance to recoup yet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed bit back a howl.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon’s a dweeb. I know he told you. I didn’t mean it. I was…-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Don’t worry about it. You’ve lived with being pissy and confused longer than I have. Shoot me some pointers sometime.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">That earned him another elbow. His knees buckled under the pain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Augh! Dammit!” He hissed between bouts of laughter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Are you okay?” Fang asked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">From this point on the ground, Reed saw the flickers of thousands of lights, like fireflies flitting about the marketplace. All of them were aimless and confused. They smiled genuinely or trained themselves to smile. Some pursued shit they didn’t need just for a taste of the former. Young lights become old lights and bright lights dulled before his eyes.   It seemed retarded until he realized they had to smile for themselves, or no one else would.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Like a million bucks, bro,” he groaned, and peeled himself back up again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">AFTERWARD:</div><div class="fanfic-line">The Volcano High Gazelle was a local rag ran by the media department. They always fucked up the typeset and got their work out late. No one read the stuff, either. It was all fedshit or idpol crap or clique talk, but Reed tolerated this issue because they were featured, somewhere.</div><div class="fanfic-line">That, and Trish read it on his lap, smothering him in bountiful booty once again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Here we are!” she squealed and her eyes shined, but she suddenly went quiet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Woah, hey there! Aw man…” Reed followed her example, and facepalmed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the far corner of the music section, VVURM DRAMA had a glowing review:</div><div class="fanfic-line">“A perfect post-ironic embrace of buttrock with a nowave edge and lyrics that defy structure. VVURM DRAMA finally embracing a guitarist milked sweet melodies from their group that no one expected before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Most importantly, the band members' clashing ensembles belies their synchronicity. It’d be hard to draw comparisons, especially when the bassist and drummer were tighter on each other than birds to an herbivore. Their matching, sweat-soaked casualware resembled the aftermath of a landmine in a stoner’s bedroom, and their sunglasses looked like the Blues Brothers after getting stomped by a mammoth a few hundred times.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You had to be there to dig it. The moshpit was intense! Shoutout to Stella. Sorry for stepping on your face.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yours truly,</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anpterasaur Fantano</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We look retarded.” Trish groaned.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even in a black and white photograph, Trish and Reed’s expressions were perfectly immortalized: their bodies swung helplessly their respective pluck and thump. Their mouths hung wide open, with what looked like a perfect string of spit flying from Reed’s maw.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“That’s like, a one-in-a-million shot. The light had to be perfect. That’s my spit! Rock on!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Come on!” Trish whined, and she pounded herself into his junk in protest.</div>
