                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Some Race-Play Fetishist's Smut Fiction</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang, Trish</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: NSFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Anonymous</div><div class="fanfic-line">â€‹</div><div class="fanfic-line">As the last bell for the day rings and everyone streams to the exits, I find myself fighting against the crowd and working my way deeper into the school</div><div class="fanfic-line">My destination is clear in my mind, but it feel like the distance has doubled since I last walked here</div><div class="fanfic-line">The school auditorium, specifically the backstage doors</div><div class="fanfic-line">What would normally be one of my safe, regular hangout spots at school is now a foreboding monolith of uncertainty</div><div class="fanfic-line">All because of one stupid text message</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Meet me backstage after school. We'll settle this once and for all, ape" - Trish</div><div class="fanfic-line">That stupid trigger, just what does she have planned?</div><div class="fanfic-line">I knew Trish had it out for me, but I never expected she would call me out so directly</div><div class="fanfic-line">Should I really go in? Should I call Reed or Fang for backup?</div><div class="fanfic-line">No, I must face this alone. Mama didn't raise no bitch</div><div class="fanfic-line">Mustering all of my strength, I throw open the metal doors as dramatically as possible</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sadly, the effect is far less impressive than I hoped, the doors barely make back to the walls</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stupid hydraulic door bullshit</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish is standing in the center of the room, looking pissed off and unimpressed as usual</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, I'm surprised you actually had the balls to show up." She glares as the doors swing closed behind me</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Cut the crap Trish" I retort, trying to sound more confident than I feel, "I'm missing out on some quality shitposting time, so let's make this quick."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fine." She snarls, clenching her fists and stomping up to me. Oh god, those horns could gore me in a second if she wanted to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I am totally out of my league here, these noodle arms of mine can't compete with this bundle of pissed off lizard</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I know why you're really dating Fang." She declares, jabbing an accusing finger into my chest</div><div class="fanfic-line">The bottom of my stomach drops out. How on earth did she find out about Naomi's bullshit "plan"?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Has she been spying on me? Did Naomi try to recruit her as well? No, Naomi would never involve Trish in all this</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just lie Anon, bullshit your way out of this</div><div class="fanfic-line">"O-oh yeah?" I stammer, trying to keep cool, "And what reason is that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's because..." She smirks triumphantly, "You're just a disgusting, dirty degenerate with a dino fetish."</div><div class="fanfic-line">...What?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, shit. I mean... she's not technically wrong, I guess?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Damn, did I say that last part out loud?</div><div class="fanfic-line">C'mon man, get that mumbling under control</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I knew it." she grins mischievously, "You're just another typical filthy human male enslaved to your own brutish desires. You don't really care about Fang, she's just a trophy to you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Holy crap Trish really is a racist cunt</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So!" Trish continues, flicking her hair and stepping back before I can retort, "You clearly have no self control, and I won't let Fang fall victim to your prolific lust."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish pulls her hoodie up and over her head, tossing it into a heap across the room</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait, hold up. What the fuck is happening here</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without hesitation she grabs the hem of her shirt and hikes it up, revealing a small lavender bra and a cute set of perky, freckled breasts</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuuuuuuck is this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You're not going to get Fang." she declares, jabbing me in the chest with her finger as her breasts push up against my shirt. "Because I'm going to take care of all those filthy urges of yours."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Holy Raptor Jesus this girl is absolutely fucking nuts</div><div class="fanfic-line">Did I fall into some race-play fetishist's smut fiction?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish turns around and grabs one of the metal folding chairs nearby.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Leaning against the back, She thrusts out her ass and arches her back seductively</div><div class="fanfic-line">Looking over her shoulder at me, she reaches behind her and unclasps the button atop her wildly swishing tail</div><div class="fanfic-line">The sound of her jeans falling to the floor is like the drop of an atomic bomb, but I'm too far gone at this point to notice</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You can rut me like a beast in heat as long as you want, you brute." Trish licks her lips in anticipation, her eyes wild and frantic, "But I promise, I won't succumb to your giant monkey dick."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Man, I was not prepared to deal with this today</div><div class="fanfic-line">I just want to go home</div><div class="fanfic-line">I want to go home, crawl in the shower, and scrub these horrible memories away</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, what are you waiting for??" Trish demands, scooting the chair backwards towards me, "Get over here and pin me down. Pump my womb full of your stinking human baby batter! Make me a race traitor!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even from a distance I can see her panties are completely soaked. This crazy bitch is way to into this</div><div class="fanfic-line">A dedicated team of the nation's top psychologists couldn't unravel the spaghetti pile of deep seated mental issues on full display here</div><div class="fanfic-line">I only now realize I've subconsciously backed all the way up to the wall, putting this crazy triceratops between me and the only escape from this nightmare</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish's breathing is growing more and more frantic, and I can tell she's getting closer and closer to snapping</div><div class="fanfic-line">If I don't give her what she wants, she likely to just take it by force</div><div class="fanfic-line">Please Reed, Stella, Rosa, Spears, ANYONE. SAVE ME FROM THIS CRAZY BITCH</div><div class="fanfic-line">The door flies open and Fang strides in, looking down at a piece of paper</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey Anon, do you want to go over this new science project we got?" She asks, looking up, "I figured we should pick a topic or-</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh thank God, it's Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">OH GOD FUCK, IT'S FANG</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang stares at the ridiculous scene on display in front of her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish, her oldest childhood friend, is half stripped down and panting like a horny dog while presenting her ass to me, who is pressed up against the wall like a prison inmate mid-escape</div><div class="fanfic-line">Somewhere in the distance, a pencil falls off a desk</div><div class="fanfic-line">"This... isn't what it looks like." I manage to choke out</div><div class="fanfic-line">Actually, come to think of it. This is probably exactly what it looks like</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fang!" Trish shouts, turning beet red and jumping up straight. She quickly tries to hide her shame, pulling down her shirt and inching over to her discarded jeans</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I uh..." Trish stammers, sweating profusely.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I mean, this is all his fault!" She points her finger at me, "He cornered me in here and tried to force himself on me!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, the sheer audacity of this bitch. I am so getting you back for this one day Trist, mark my words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Really Trish?" Fang crosses her arms, visibly rolling her eyes, "I'm not an idiot. I know exactly what's going on here."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thankfully it seems my girlfriend isn't susceptible to B-Tier Hentai plot bullshit</div><div class="fanfic-line">I might actually make it out of here with my pelvis intact</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I figured you two would hate-fuck eventually." Fang explains, "About time too, you really need to get it out of your systems."</div><div class="fanfic-line">...Oh no</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh please no Fang, don't abandon me!</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anyway, I'll just wait outside until you're done" Fang waves, opening the door and stepping outside, "Have fun you two!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh lord why have you forsaken me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Was it the porn? The shitposting? The vaguely racist memes?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish stares in astonishment as the door clicks shut, unwilling or incapable of comprehending what just happened</div><div class="fanfic-line">Slowly her gaze returns to me, her eyes once more consumed by insane lust</div><div class="fanfic-line">Aw, fuck me...</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That's the idea." Trish grins</div>
