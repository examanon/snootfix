She's pretty sure she set her phone on silent</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It calls out again, the tone finally sparking a memory in the sleepy dinosaur's mind. There's only one person that can always reach her, phone settings or not</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish is their rock, their safe port away from the stormy seas of their life. When all else fails, they can always turn to her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But, they know she does shift-work. What could be so import-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The sounds don't stop. They rush together, bumping into each-other, like a broken record forever stuck playing a single note</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The small triceratops springs up, urgently grabbing at the phone at her night stand, blasting her eyes with its piercing white glow</div><div class="fanfic-line">>By the time Trish's eyes adjust, the text chat in front of them is running millions of miles per minute</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's her best friend, Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The text is nearly impossible to decipher. Typos, incomplete sentences, acronyms she's never seen, all blending together</div><div class="fanfic-line">>However, there is one pattern that keeps repeating itself. A set of characters: A, O, and N strewn around every other sentence</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The skinny schizo fucked up again</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anger, rage, and utter helplessness flood into Trish's phone, Fang unloading what can only be the results of another fight with Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With each message read, feelings of helplessness intensify in the petite triceratops</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Why oh why did she accept a career so far away? She could have waited a little bit longer with the money she had, maybe gotten a job within driving distance</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now she's stuck a million miles away from Volcaldera while Fang resorts to renting a shitty apartment with a person they should instead be using for boxing practice</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish's fingers hammer away at her phone, desperately trying to stem the tide of anguish coming from the other end</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe this time she can convince them to leave that asshole. Skimping out on a few things to get her friend a plane ticket out of there is the least she can do</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish sets her phone back down on the nightstand, its job done</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Despite all her protesting, pleading, and persuading, she couldn't get Fang to commit to anything. All Trish could do was calm them down until they finally went to sleep</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And now she sits, fully awake. Any thoughts of going back to sleep are completely ruined by that god damned skinny</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A bubbling fury rises up within the tiny triceratops. Only one thing can settle this: revenge</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Every now and then, Fang sends her a picture of themself and Anon, showing her quick glimpses into their life</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's a small matter to go through them, selecting the most appropriate ones to work with</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A few tutorials online was all it took before Trish had gained a decent understanding of photo manipulation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Finding a place to put the images online wasn't too hard either. Just had to search up for the toilet of the internet to find where Anon and his bigot cohorts would be</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Some days, all it takes is one picture to receive dozens if not hundreds of replies, as she pretends to be him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She knows he's there, unable to do anything but impotently screech at her works. He dares not bring it up anywhere else for fear of being found out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>So, which anime character is going to enjoy a nice date with Anon today?</div>
