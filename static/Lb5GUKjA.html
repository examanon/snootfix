Archiveanon looked at the amount of fresh holes in his walls and compared them to the patched ones. Hours...no days….he settled on days. He should try to sleep, if only to attempt to. Another notification from discord pinged, the shitposts never stopped. At this rate he would have to archive all of them. Eventually the need to sleep took over and he walked to his bed. With a flop he fell into it. Several things swam though his mind. All of them involved Tracy, his perfect Dinowaifu. He thought of being stepped on by lovely feet. How she would smile and twist her foot over his body. Sometimes a strong kick, others a soft rub. Thoughts of her tasting him with a spatula and a hotdog bun overwhelmed him. Would she use ketchup or relish?  How silly of him he thought she would use all the fixings. Only the perfect Chicago street dog would work. The bread would be a 7-Nut whole grain loaf. How devilish of her. With that he fell asleep. A long and deep sleep, full of dreams. He would wake soon, his work was never done after all.</div>
