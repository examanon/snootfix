Your wife, Naomi, stands in the kitchen. The warm yellow light from the above-the-stove light casts an intense tangerine hue over her creamy skin and short cut blonde hair. Her emerald eyes reflect the sharp light as she stirs the pot of whatever-it-is, her humming fills the air. You refrain from announcing your presence, opting instead to take her by surprise. You gently take your shoes off, giving you an edge in your stealth. You walk softly, your arms around her waist shocking her just a bit. Naomi flinches, but upon realizing it's only you, she relaxes against you. She cranes her head upwards, peering at you upside down and smiling. Your lean forward and kiss her as her tail beats against your leg. "Dinner's almost ready dearest." She says, her sickly-sweet voice permeating the air. You thank her and turn to leave, to get showered and cleaned up, but her tail has wrapped against your leg. You look back to see a devious glint in her eye. "Aren't you going to thank me?" She says quietly. Voice full of playful menace. You utter your gratitude, but her tail pulls you against her. Her smile has reached her ears, a lecherous look twisting her features. She pushes her ass against your crotch, grinding against you softly. "Oh, come on... I'm sure there's better ways to show your appreciation than that..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">oth your heart and your loins are flushed with heat as you twitch inside of your pants. Your hands find her waist and stroke against her skin as she continues to bump, press, and grind against you. Eventually you can’t take it anymore. You thrust, bumping back against her. Your hand circles flat against her thigh before slapping against her ass. She bites her lip, head pitching forward and hair falling around obscuring her face. Your hands move to the front of her pants and undo the button and zipper there. While she slides her pants down you do the same for yours, leaving nothing between your skin. You take a handful off ass-flesh, the soft silken skin feeling nice in your hand as you squeeze, slap, and stroke. Her rubbing gets more intense, her breathing getting heavier. Eventually she reaches around and grasps at your erect member, jerking it a few times to help it along. A bead of clear precum oozes out, the sticky liquid leaving a gossamer strand between the tip and the splotch that dripped onto her hand. The length feels electric, every minute brush of her skin sending waves of pleasure across the surface. She guides it to the entrance, leaving the rest up to you as she submits. You spit a little, watching the dribbling saliva slowly make its long descent like a spider. Once you’re sure you’ve been properly lubricated you grasp, tense, and push inwards as Naomi lets out a sharp gasp. Pained, but mixed with pleasure and surprise. You swear, it’s like she never gets used to it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You press forward and pull out a few times, a few short and cautious thrusts prepping the both of you. Acclimating yourselves. Her knuckles clench around the oven handle as she presses her body against the counter. One hand breaks away to push the pot of boiling dinner off the heated section and deftly turns off the dial. You begin to pick up speed, relishing in the sound of her breath hitching and becoming strained. You grab her tail and yank it upwards roughly, leaning it across your chest so the tip rests past your shoulder. You gently pet and rub the length with your hand, slapping against it a few times for good measure.  It twitches and flicks. You pull out and slam with all your might, rocking her body and pushing it over the counter a bit. Oh, she liked that alright. Again. Again. Her breathing is getting more and more ragged. You slap her ass. Hard. She pushes against you with more force, trying to get as much of you stuffed inside of her as she can. Her back arcs as her knees bend, going weak. Now’s your chance. Your arm snakes across her throat and you flex a bit, tightening around it. You pull her neck and head back up towards your own so you can look her in the eyes. Her verdant orbs look at you with longing as she lolls her tongue out. The look in her eyes says, ‘More’, and you oblige by tightening your grip even further. Her skin is now deeply flushed, both with arousal and asphyxiation.</div>
