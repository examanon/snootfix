                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: When Life Gives You Tarot Cards</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: P.M.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's stomach churns</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He can't quite determine the cause of it however</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Either it was the airplane food that he ate maybe half an hour ago</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Or it was the idea of seeing everyone again after all the months apart filling him to the brim with anxiety</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Especially the idea of seeing Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Being away from her after all that time together took its toll on Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The both of them talk daily, but it's no comparison to actually being there to hold her, to love her, to tell her just how lucky he is to be with her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The weekly recital of their song over the phone kept their love for each other strong, but drove daggers tinged with homesickness into Anon's heart</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Still, it's a good pain. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, or so he's been told</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A cardboard rectangle drops from Anon's hand onto the floor, his fingers fumbling at a critical moment as the card twirled around them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella had given him this card. It was right when everything in his life had finally clicked together, before he left for college</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe she had cheated the outcome, maybe not. He's kept the card close to him as a reminder regardless</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And there it lies, face up, upright</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The Lovers, art emblazoned on the face depicting a human and a pterosaur locked in an embrace.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon bends down from his seat and grabs the card, securing it back inside the coat pocket hugging his chest, as close to his heart as he can place it</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking back, the future those cards foretold was prophetic. The threads of fate plucked and depicted on their surface fulfilling themselves in a frightening fashion</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon really should have asked Stella for crypto advice</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He still can't believe how high Snootcoin is surging. The current price can fund his entire education and have some left over for a house down-payment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Something about a new update to the |Generation-Of-Snootcoin.LING| mining protocol causing an extreme shortage in newly created coins</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh well, no point in complaining. He has it good enough already considering where he is</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A giant metal tube with wings, thousands of feet from the ground, moving at blistering speeds</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang's parents went out of their way to help fund a flight back to Volcaldera for the holidays</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The notion was unbelievable to Anon. He had offered to simply take a cross-country bus, but Fang's Mother countered with how much time would be wasted traveling</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She wasn't wrong. By the time Anon arrived he would have to pack to leave again</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He didn't think his relationship with them was that good, considering how rocky it seemed all those months ago</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They even got him an exit seat. Leg room for days.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's parents certainly didn't put forth any effort in seeing their only son during Christmas</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He still sent them a postcard. Sometimes you alone have to be the change you want to see in the world</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A vibration on Anon's leg grabs his attention</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There sits the ceramic slab of his phone. The constant stream of messages during the flight demolished any thoughts of pocketing it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It also threw away his thoughts of sleeping through the flight. Jet lag may get him later, but that's what copious amounts of coffee is for</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe Reed will share that special blend he's been talking about for the past few days</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Let's see here...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A picture from Stella shows up at the top of his phone notifications</div><div class="fanfic-line">>An intricate constellation of tarot cards is laid out before him, their meaning incomprehensible to an unpracticed reader like Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She knows this of course, with Anon's message feed quickly filling up with the answers to his unsaid questions</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With how quick and how chipper Stella's messages are, he knows there's nothing to worry about mere minutes into the reading</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Still, he indulges her. It helps take his mind off his anxiety, and her enthusiasm is infectious</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Might be worthwhile to actually learn a bit about it. Impress the lads on campus with some tricks</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As expected, the reading finishes on a hopeful note, the only roadblock being a warning about a future conflict</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The way it's displayed, it could only be referring to Fang's father, Ripley</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There are certainly a lot of rough edges remaining to work through with him. At this point, Anon is confident Ripley at least trusts him with his daughter</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After all, she's the one picking him up from the airport</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Another message hits Anon's phone, this time from Reed</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Confirmation that the dinner reservation at Dino-Moes has been set</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Uncle Moe might not be there to greet them, but the atmosphere and memories created there made any other place for a reunion seem unsuitable</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The amount of schedules that lined up for this is practically a miracle</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang, Trish, Reed, Stella, Rosa, Naser, and himself. It feels like it's been forever since they were all together like this</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi can't make it, but that might be for the better. Things are still raw between her and Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon shoots Reed a message about the coffee, his previous question returning to him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...And apparently it is also unsuitable for human consumption</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Seriously what are dinosaurs made of? An invasive thought pierces into Anon's brain making him consider if he should minor in dino-biology</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But that thought train derails before it even clears the station. His scholarship can only go so far. He's stretching it as is</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He'd have to bug one of his dorm-mates about it. Surely one of them was taking dino-biology</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's not done with Reed just yet though</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He can't have his bro deny him all the time, he needs that coffee. Surely there is some sort of agreement they can come to</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If he doesn't violate Reed's non-aggression pact anyway</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A battle of wills flash over the two, artillery barrages of words shot over radio waves detonating into each-other's arguments</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Good thing Anon's ticket included wifi. He doesn't think that the cell towers underneath him can handle this kind of warfare</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The intensity waxed and waned as battle lines were redrawn with every sentence.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And then it was over, the digital landscape forever altered, twin white flags of truce flying high</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon is getting his coffee after all, once Reed figures out how much he needs to dilute it. Reed needed a test subject anyway as he expands into the skinny market</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Some cheeky words from him confirm that he was goofing around. The guy must be really bored right now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon is still chalking that up as a win. It doesn't matter to him whether or not Reed gets it right the first time anyway</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Either it keeps Anon awake for just long enough to fall asleep in Fang's embrace</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Or he makes up for lost time and takes comfort in the feeling of downy feathers draping over him, her heart beating with his, their chests rising and falling in tandem</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Can always sleep later if it comes down to it. He feels that he's been asleep most of his life anyway, only recently having woken up to actually enjoy it</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Speaking of, another vibration of Anon's phone alerts him to Fang's arrival at the airport, proof manifesting in a selfie showing both her and the airport lobby</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She wears a fragile smile that mirrors the anxiety within Anon's heart</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Quickly, the decision is made to send a picture back to Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon angles the camera and takes the photo, immediately sending it on its way</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He opens the picture afterwards to admire his handiwork and-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ah fuck he looks hideous. These tiny phone cameras always do something weird with his face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's as if it can't tell there's a face there at all, the post-processing smearing all his features together</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This time it made him look like a flesh horror, like something out of a creepy-pasta</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang on the other hand is drowning Anon's phone in text messages, each one spiraling further and further into exuberant laughter</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She really wants to know what kind of photo filter Anon used</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...Just roll with it. This must replaced the fragility in her smile with something more assured</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He's about to minimize the photo when he notices something odd about one of the passengers behind him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He zooms in until-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What? Who wears a Burger Rex crown inside a plane?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That guy's eyeing the triceratops across the aisle rather intensely</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There's no way this is going to end well</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He's gotta get off this plane</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As if Anon's prayers were answered, the intercom crackles on</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the plane steward announces to the passengers of their imminent landing, and to follow some guidelines to ensure passenger safety</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Upright seat, check. Tray table, check. Seat Belt, check. Wireless electronics?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon types out a short message to Fang that he's landing, and will see her soon before tapping on airplane mode and stowing the phone in a pocket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He can't wait to get out of this chair. Between the constant messages and the occupant of the seat beside him, Anon has been sitting down for the better part of 4 hours</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Couldn't even grab the laptop out from his carry-on luggage to get through some of his anime backlog</div><div class="fanfic-line">>How Pterodons could get that fat, He didn't know. Fang wasn't joking when she said she won the genetic lottery</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The window beside him draws Anon's attention, the flickering landscape catching the corner of his eye</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Doesn't look like much has changed in Volcaldera Bluffs. Then again, it hasn't been that long</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Can even see the shit-hole of his old apartment. That place would have made him neck himself eventually had he stuck around</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The apartment gets swallowed up by the surrounding city skyline, and then by the treeline as the plane makes its touchdown</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The rumble of Anon's seat and the slight strain of his seatbelt confirm the plane's successful contact with the runway, it's brakes engaging.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With butterflies in his stomach, Anon waits for the airplane to taxi down the tarmac</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Thank you for flying P.T. Aero, where our wings span from coast-to-coast!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A groan escapes from Anon as he finally gets out of his seat, his muscles and bones protesting the movement</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He couldn't believe how long it took the ptero beside him to get out of his seat and grab his stuff</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now only a few others remain with him on the plane, lethargically grabbing their belongings. They must have been lucky enough to catch some sleep</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The rest filed out minutes earlier</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang was sure to be worried if he wasn't with the rest of the crowd entering the terminal</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When it became obvious that the Fat Bastard imitator was going to delay him, he sent her a message, but he has yet to receive a reply</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon opens the overhead compartment to grab his carry-on luggage</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A blurry cube smashes into Anon's face as soon as the door cracks open, imprinting dulled visions of stars and fireworks into his vision</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fucking hell, he doesn't have time for this shit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Was this the actual danger Stella's reading hinted at?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That he'd be accosted by bullshit until Fang thought he was lying about being on that plane and just left?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His hand blindly dives into the compartment, grabbing hold of his luggage straps and yanking it free of its confines</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It swings down with a thud, smacking into the chair below</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A note of exasperation leaves Anon as his vision clears. He could really go for a smoke right about now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What even fell out? There's nothing on the floor</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He kneels down, casting his gaze under the seats</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There it is, the dark cube. Well, more of a box really, embossed with reflective foil</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella's old tarot deck, another part of Anon's going away gift she gave him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He doesn't remember packing it, how did it get here?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Questions for later</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon pockets the deck and makes his way to leave the plane, his path flowing around the remaining stragglers</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh god how many planes are unboarding right now?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon remains stuck behind a mass of people moving at the speed of bureaucracy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Did that fat ptero get stuck? Or was there an altercation between that Burger Rex guy and someone else?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Some of them are even trying to use a treadmill walkway as a shortcut</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It might have been a good idea, had it been moving in the right direction</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Each passing moment only adds to Anon's anxiety</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His message to Fang remains unanswered. Better send another one to make certain she knows what's going on</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At least the music is nice. Is that a live performer? Hard to make out with the bustling crowd in front of him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Didn't know airports had live performances. Thought they were pretty strict when it came to soliciting and security</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Thank fuck, finally some movement.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As if a clog in the aisle was finally removed, the mass of people drain into the airport arrivals lobby</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A hefty amount of them seem to be clustering around the seating area, from where the music is playing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sounds like someone is covering the latest pop sensations with an acoustic guitar</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon scans the crowd, trying to find his pale better-half in the sea of rainbow</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...She's not there. He must have missed her, he just has to look harder</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yet, no matter how many times he goes over the horde of people, he can't find her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's heart catches itself in his throat, irregular breathing syncopating with his pulse</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fuck! Where is she?!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon grabs at his phone again. Still no reply</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Should he call her?! He should call her! He's going to call her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Frantic fingers navigate through his phone menus, bringing up Fang's contact info</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He hits the dial prompt then brings the phone to his ear</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It rings once, twice, three times and-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With a click, Anon is suddenly hearing double, the music from the performer coming out from his phone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Before Anon's chaotic thoughts can settle, he is interrupted by the voice of a child</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hello!?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That's not Fang. That's not even remotely close to Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon quickly double checks the number he's currently dialing, confirming that it is in fact her number</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What's going on here? Is she playing a prank on him?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe the child knows? Worth a shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hey, I'm Anon, is Fang there?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The sounds of shuffling are heard through the ear-speaker before Fang's phone drops down onto something soft</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The voice coming through Anon's phone is further away from what he can determine, but no less excited</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Miss Fang! Phone's for you! His name is An On!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And just like that, the musical echo halts for a moment, before being fortified with a melody that pierces straight into Anon's soul</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He knows that singing, that song. He knows it by heart</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His body snaps towards the crowd by the seating area once more</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She's in there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All those months at college navigating crowded corridors trained Anon for this moment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Also helps that his phone's loudspeaker is communicating to the surrounding horde to make way for him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He almost feels like Dino Moses with how they part for him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon passes through just before the tunnel of people closes up on him</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There she is, all bundled up in winter wear</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A most plain person by dinosaur standards. They might even call her a monochromatic weirdo</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But to Anon? To Anon, her pale radiance shines forth like a beacon, beckoning him towards her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She is completely in her element, surrounded by a completely enthralled audience</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon included. He dares not break formation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She's strong enough to do this on her own. She's been strong enough since that one fateful concert</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Gone is the broken melody that took both their combined efforts to keep steady</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In its place, the harmonious whole sings out, all those weekend practices over video-chat showing their results</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And so Anon waits. He had waited so long already, a few minutes longer is nothing by comparison</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A small pastel coloured dinosaur catches Anon's eye, a triceratops sitting right beside Fang having the time of her life</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She must have been the child on the other side of the call</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looks like her grandfather is right there too, judging by how old he looks, with an open guitar case by his feet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Answers Anon's question about where the unfamiliar guitar Fang is playing came from</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The harmonic chords echoing off the airport walls announce the end of Fang's miniature concert</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The applause and cheers could have been a song of its own with how enthusiastic they are</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang is entirely unperturbed, smiling as she hands the guitar back to the old man while receiving a hug from her biggest, yet smallest, fan as payment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She then sweeps her eyes across the audience, scanning their faces, committing them to a memory</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And then she sees Anon, eyes locking onto his in recognition</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He lets go of a breath he didn't know he was holding and steps forward, dropping his luggage on the ground</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang was on him in the blink of an eye, outstretched arms latching together above Anon's shoulders, the momentum sending them both into a spin</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Arms clasp around Fang in a desperate attempt to keep both of them upright, holding her aloft as they come to a stop</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They could have been figure skaters with moves like that</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A thought for later. They haven't gone ice skating yet, have they?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon continues to hold Fang tight as he sets her back onto the ground, whispering words for her ears only</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I missed you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I missed you too, dweeb."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He holds her there. He holds her until his heart calms, until his weakness leaves, until the sounds of the airport lobby return</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They then part, Fang clasping Anon's hands in hers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She kept her promise. Her wings are fuller then on the day he left, her eyes full of driving determination, her face showing no signs of emaciation, and her hands</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her hands are as soft as a professional guitarist's can be</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But something catches the corner of Anon's eyes in those hands</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang notices where they trail to, giving him an affirming nod to continue</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon turns their clasped hands, until the back of hers lies upward</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The chaotic symbol is gone, an old memory of desperate misery obliterated. New ink adorns her hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In its place, a bright star blazes as if depicting the fire found within her soul all that time ago at Stickstock</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The spokes of the tattoo underneath have been transformed into fiery prominences arcing across her hand, twisting around and conjoining each-other in a silent dance</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It's beautiful."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon plants a kiss on it. Fang can punch his shoulder all she wants for that, he'll take it in stride</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There's no song tempo he can think of that matches the beat of Fang's tail whipping back and forth however</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He'd say it matches the redness forming across her face more closely</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe he'll avoid some bruises this time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But she's not done with her reveal yet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang's free hand moves up to the knit cap she's wearing, pulling it off in one smooth motion</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Locks of flowing silver hair cascade downward, swinging and swaying until it finally stills itself above her shoulders</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...So that's why some of the photos she sent him were oddly cropped</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's hand finds itself reaching, caressing her head in his hand, feeling her hair part in his fingers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang leans into his touch, eyes closing as they both enjoy the nostalgic feeling from years long gone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yet, the burning love in Anon's heart urges him onward. He couldn't possibly hope to extinguish its flames with this alone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It made his soul tremble and ache, as if responding to all the wrongs and injustices he created that were slowly being healed</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That he had changed</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He moves in, the hand cradling her head angling her upward, and plants his kiss on her lips</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Electrifying contact. Fang's eyes flare open at the touch before she resigns herself to it, accepting all of Anon's love, and giving hers in return</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It has been so long. Anon found himself lost in a memory of a kiss shared before he left. Melancholy tinged the edges of the memory with visions of unbound tears</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This, however, is nothing like that old memory. All he can feel in this moment is unrestrained exhilaration</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But, the cheers and whistles from the surrounding crowd remind them that they are not alone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang separates with a giggle. Musical performances were one thing but something so emotionally charged was another</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Mister! You dropped this!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The pastel child had returned. In her outstretched hands is the patterned box containing Anon's tarot cards</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It must have been flung from his pocket as he and Fang whirled around in their embrace</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He accepts his cards back from the child, ruffling her hair with a hand before she runs off back to her grandfather</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang gives the box an inquisitive look before recognition flashes over her face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Tarot cards?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah, Stella's old set. They ended up in my bag somehow. Don't know how they got there."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang hums out a note of contemplation before she asks if Anon knows how to use them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Certainly not, but what Stella used to do seemed simple enough</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The two of them can always ask her what it means later today at Dino-Moes anyway</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The cardboard flap is opened, the cards withdrawn</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon fans them out, their faces obscured from sight</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Does it matter if they've been shuffled or not?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's not like he sorted them or anything. They haven't been removed from the package since Stella gave them to him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon comes to the conclusion that as far as he is concerned, they're shuffled</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang's hand hovers over the cards, her expression wrinkling in concentration</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She pinches at a card, before reconsidering, moving over to the one beside it and pulling it free</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Card in hand, Fang regards it, eyebrows furrowed in thought as she tries to grasp some meaning from it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She's not satisfied with her solitary thoughts on it, turning the card face to Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The text on the upright card gives a hint to its meaning</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The World</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon has no idea what it means</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Regardless, Fang is still looking at him like he can give her an explanation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well, one certainly comes to mind</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Maybe it means 'you are the world to me'."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ok, he definitely deserved that jab to his shoulder. Still a fair trade to see her smile like that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For a second there, She almost looked like she would wrap herself in her wings to get some time to compose herself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Instead, Fang is having trouble keeping her mirth contained as the two of them make their way to the luggage carousel</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She can laugh all she wants</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's music to Anon's ears</div>
