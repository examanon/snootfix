Too many to count, all marked late with red inked stamps</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Creditors had even started garnishing his navy stipend in an effort to get their money back</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Turns out gambling is a terrible hobby to have when your expendable income can be counted with your fingers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Especially if you're not getting money in return</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He can't afford the legal work required to properly declare bankruptcy. Those assholes are sure to fuck him over just like that crayon-eating navy recruiter</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All he has are artfully rendered images that remind him of better times</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The game attached to those images lost its appeal a long time ago. It's on his phone out of habit</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's hard to leave something that's been a part of his life for so long, especially when some of those images remind him of a love long lost</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There's nothing left worth selling to pay the bills. All that remains in his skin row apartment is what came with it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His half-broken phone might fetch twenty dollars if he haggled hard enough</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He might end up doing that. It's not like he has a phone plan. No-one phones him anyway</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wifi works just fine to shitpost with and gamble his life away</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There's not much time left. His landlord already gave him the ultimatum weeks ago, and today's the day. Money or eviction</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon slams the apartment keys down on the bills as his answer before leaving, the entryway door noisily protesting the movement</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yet something nags at him, demanding he look back at his empire of dirt</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He obliges, turning around to take in one last sight of what was comfortable living</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Mounds of garbage bags, Smoke stained carpets and moldy drywall greet his vision</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He really thought he could do it, just drift through life like he always wanted to</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Life really seems to have it out for him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...or maybe it's just him. His own worst enemy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A coward who can't even use a coil of rope correctly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One consolation he holds tight to his heart is that no-one he's ever known can see how far he's fallen</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Cold evening air bites through the layers of Anon's clothing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Guess that's the first thing on the agenda.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The trip to the local charity is much more fruitful than he expected. The charity workers must have been trying for weeks to get rid of these clothes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sure all of them have various bodily fluids on them and smell horrible, but at least he's warm</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's only been a few hours and he's already fitting the part of being a hobo</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now he just needs some cardboard signs written in sharpie displaying his plight to complete the look</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That can come later. It's far too late at night to consider anything but sleep</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Despite looking the part, none of the local homeless camps want to deal with him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Too large a risk to just let some unknown person waltz in, especially a skinny.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Other potential places were either too exposed or already had measures in place to prevent people like him from sleeping there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That rainbow coloured boulder in the alcove was the icing on the cake.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He can't go on forever. The lethargy attacking his mind and legs threatens to knock him out as he walks</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A metallic sheen illuminated by a streetlight catches his vision</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A large commercial dumpster in a dead-end alley. Certainly large enough to fit Anon, and the shop its behind looks abandoned</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He wanders over, flipping up the lid to reveal its contents. Cardboard, styrofoam, and some plastic sheeting.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Surprise grips him. It looks too good to be true</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Then again, who lives in a garbage container? Guess it'll be him. Trash begets trash he figures</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon hops in, pushing the cardboard around to make sleeping space</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The damp smell of mold reminds him of home as he makes himself comfortable</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...Good enough. The spores can be roommates with the cigarette tar in his lungs</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Days turn into weeks turn into months as Anon gets himself into a routine</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wake up whenever, wander to some crowded place, beg for food or money, get chased out by the police or angry mobs. Repeat until it's time to return to the dumpster for sleep</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He wasn't sure what was worse, being ostracized or being completely ignored</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At least the people chasing him confirm he exists first</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Some days are better than others, but Anon's addiction to cigarettes forces a choice onto him. Hunger or peace from his cravings?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Other days he doesn't get to make that choice, the bruises along his body bearing witness to disagreements escalated by irritability</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His phone didn't make it through one of those days, his last link to the internet completely severed</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The long periods of downtime give Anon plenty of time to think, to yearn, to regret</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All those years, wasted. Everything he did to prevent this, worthless. Every person who ever cared about him, long gone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All that time spent trying to get a laugh from people who now would prefer seeing him beaten or dead, pointless</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It really put the plight of the homeless into perspective for him, now having first-hand experience</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If he could go back in time, he would be the one punching himself on that beach, unleashing all his rage and regret into someone too dumb to know just how good he had it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yet, despite everything, a burning desire exists in Anon's heart for the first time in his life</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It isn't enough to simply exist, listlessly drifting down the river of life</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If he ever gets out of this living hell, he's going to make absolutely certain he never returns</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon startles awake with a bang and sudden crushing pressure on his body</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The blinding light above him is quickly obscured as piles of junk are tossed in</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Just his fucking luck that someone would actually use the dumpster for its intended purpose</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All his shouting doesn't stop them. It almost seems to encourage them to pile it in faster</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The voices above are too deep to be human. God damned racist dinosaurs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>By the end of it, Anon can hardly breathe, the large mass of it pressing down on his chest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He pushes up against the trash ceiling, his emaciated arms shaking under strain</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His fears of being buried alive are alleviated as he feels his obstacle shift, a small window of light appearing overhead</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He rests for a minute before continuing his self-excavation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Push and rest. Push and rest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The shifting glare from the skylight above counts the time as Anon drives himself to sheer exhaustion</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With one final heave, the way opens up, the hole opening just enough to let Anon squeeze himself through</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He slumps down on the concrete, his back against his home, as he greedily replaces the mold in his lungs with fresh air</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If it wasn't already late enough in the day, Anon is in no condition to go anywhere. Today is chosen for him, he goes hungry</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He still needs to clean out his home before the sun sets</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One staggering lurch later, Anon finds himself upright, facing the dumpster</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...There's a lot of junk in there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Better get started</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Streetlights sparked on, giving Anon the last of the light he needed to scour the dumpster</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He bends in and grabs one final bag, giving it a heaving throw onto the pile with the rest of its kind</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He'd have to go through them later. There might be something usable inside</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon hefts himself up, feet swinging over into his home before stopping</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Something is rubbing up against his shoes. The bottom of the dumpster isn't that shallow</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He hops off the metal rim, and reaches back in, feeling for the foreign object</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh hey, comes with a handle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon pulls it free, the streetlight outlining a curved shape</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What even is this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He pulls the object up to the light, illuminating the edges</div><div class="fanfic-line">>An oblong body, a long section, an oddly placed handle</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's a guitar case, and judging by its weight, it's not empty</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The clasps holding the body together are undone, the lid flipped open</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What greets Anon makes him wonder if he should grab a lottery ticket with the remaining change in his pocket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A beat up acoustic guitar stares back at him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The face of the guitar well worn, well loved. The varnish is peeling off in patches, with stickers of unknown bands and albums patterned across it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The fretboard is similarly dull, surviving countless days and countless hands. The metal frets have worn notches from strings grinding against it over all the years</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The metal gleam on the strings mark them as new, unblemished by the elements</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He pulls the guitar out of its case, resting it on his lap, feeling the weight and shape of it against his body</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His hand up running and down the neck reveals the flaw that destined it for the landfill</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Its wooden neck is slightly twisted, having fought a losing battle against the tensioned strings for years and years</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon feels a kindred spirit somewhere in there. It's broken, broken just like him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He fiddles with the tuning keys, memories of old songs used as a guide</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But what to play?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's been so long since he played a guitar, not since those lazy days in the room of a person he used to love</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There's only one song his fingers remember. It drives daggers into his heart to even consider it, but it's all he knows.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Quavering hands get into position, and he strums the the first notes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The sounds reach his ears as his heart screams at him to stop, yet he presses on. Everything that he can remember about those days sounds out through the guitar</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The resulting melody that echoes out is incomplete, off key, broken. Absolutely perfect</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The soundtrack to Anon's life</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He plays late into the night, until his heart can finally take it, like a bitter medicine</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His eyes are another story, but he doesn't need clear vision to play</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If anyone cares enough to ask, it's raining</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The days and weeks that followed made Anon feel like he had entered into another world</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As it turns out, people are much more willing to help a musician who looks down on his luck over a dirty hobo</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even if his playing is atrocious</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They were either paying for Anon to continue playing, or for him to stop</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He desperately hoped it was the former. At least people aren't pretending he doesn't exist anymore</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Also turns out that 24-hour gym chains are a cheap place to clean up. Get a membership and go during the dead hours near midnight</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Can even sneak in a few hours of sleep in a warm building if the cameras don't see him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Between that and some new clothes, he almost looks presentable</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The transient audiences he plays for seem to think so too, as the amount of money being thrown into his guitar case increases week to week</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even if Fang didn't mean to, even if she didn't want to, Anon feels her ethereal presence, helping him despite everything that happened</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He thinks of her whenever he tries to piece together the shattered memories of what they played together</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...He should have talked to her when he had the chance, or at least stayed until she had finished for the day</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Another day completed</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's starting to think he's actually pretty good with the guitar</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The cardboard sign adorning his open case now has a section for requests</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He might not be able to play every request, but his repertoire was growing by the week</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sometimes giving an earnest try was enough to satisfy them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He rounds a familiar corner, ready to be done for the day</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...It's gone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It felt too soon, yet it had to happen at some point</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The company that owns that dumpster must have finally come around to collect it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He takes a moment to observe the brightened shadow of where it used to stand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He didn't think he would be this attached to it, but it was a place he called home</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Someplace safe enough to let his guard down</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Someplace to rest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Everything he left in there is gone. He can only thank Raptor Jesus that he always brings his guitar with him, else he would be back to begging for scraps</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Back to being ignored</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon checks his wallet, contemplating renting a motel room for the night, or trying his luck at the fitness center</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The glare of the sun makes his choice for him. If he's going to rent a room, he may as well busk somewhere until the sun sets</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It'll give him some money, and some time to think</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The commercial zone near Volcano High is always a good choice</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At this time of day, the place is crowded with affluent students milling about, looking for things to alleviate their boredom</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A good portion have headphones in, closing off the outside world, but enough of them are looking for an experience they can talk about with their friends</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The loose change and bills in his guitar case can attest to that</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One dinosaur in particular has been hanging around for a while, a blue brachiosaurus. Certainly too old to be a student</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon would be annoyed at how the guy's been looking down at him, but with a neck like that, he likely doesn't have a choice</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe the guy is looking for inspiration? A guitar case decorated with emblems and decals sits by his feet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One of them sparks something in Anon's memory, but the resulting shape isn't concrete enough to grasp</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A stylized 'W' flanked by wings. The brachio's case is littered with them. Perhaps his indie band logo?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Either way, the last beams of light leaking from the horizon mark the end of Anon's busking. He grabs at the money floating around his guitar case</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Done for the day?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon pockets the last of the cash before turning around, casting his gaze upwards at his solitary audience member</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He shifts side to side, eyes unfocused, clearly in thought</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Mind taking one more request?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A request eh? If Anon didn't know any better, he'd think the guy was his first fan</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon gives him an affirmative nod. He's already here, and it's not like he has anything to be late for</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The request he's given sinks his heart</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A song of his own</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He's not a musician. He doesn't understand any of the intricacies involved with creating music. Mimicking the works of others is the sole thing he's capable of</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The only thing that could come close to his own music would be the the broken melodies floating in his soul</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Does that even count? Fang was the one who made that music. All he did was provide some thoughts, maybe some motivation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...it's all he has</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Old memories of a time long lost filled Anon's vision, the world around him fading to pinpoint lights</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Crimson wings on a roof, the intimate feeling of two bodies pressed together over a guitar, the softness of feathers draping over him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The voice of heartfelt confession, the tender touches of a loved one, and the biting rage of love scorned</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All lost to time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The world fills back in, Anon's guitar having sounded out the last recollections of his fragmented heart</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The brachiosaurus's stunned face is what greets Anon as his memories fade, his jaw slack, whispering words meant for no-one leaking through it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Sounds just like-" is what Anon swears he can hear as he rubs away the wetness in his eyes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The guy snaps back to reality, a heartfelt smile on his face. He grabs a few bills out of his wallet for Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The amount in Anon's hand is way too much. His mind scrambles trying to remember what he had just played, returning with nothing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He begins to sound out his thanks before he is interrupted by the brachio, who has his hand extended towards him</div><div class="fanfic-line">"There's more where that came from. You'd be a perfect fit for my band. We're having a rehearsal tonight if you wanna come with"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A smile creeps onto Anon's face. The motion is slow and rough, as if he was remembering how to use those muscles all over again, but no less assured</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Another hand reaches forth to grasp the other, an offer accepted</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah."</div>
