                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Anon, Fang, Reed, Trish – Dinoland</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang, Trish, Reed</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Anonymous</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The afternoon waned, the incessant ticking of the clock slowly driving me insane. I had brought them here for a reason, damnit! And now look at us: Anon and Reed are playing Xrox, totally absorbed in whatever shitty game they’re playing now, Trish is too busy painting her nails to notice anything, and what am I doing? Sitting here on this shitty basement couch, subtly dropping hints that no one understands!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Heaving another heavy sigh, I idly flip through the pages I have saved on my phone: Dinoland pricing, the best route to get there, cheap motels we could stay at. So much for my grand plan of inviting the gang over to hang out in my basement, just to make a dramatic announcement that this summer, we’re finally taking that road trip we always wanted to take. At least, the road trip I always wanted to take…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Glancing over at Anon, I can’t help but feel the familiar butterflies in my stomach once more. Somehow that stupid dweeb had captured my heart, and now every time I sneak a peak of him, it feels like… Well, like I’m looking at the person I want to be with. God, why does he have to be so hot?!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ughhh, you guys are so lame!” My exaggerated groan and full-body flop onto the floor does little to distract Anon and Reed from the screen. Fuckin’ boys. At least Trish glanced up from her nails, her face creasing in irritation. “Why don’t we dooooooooo something? Instead of just sitting in the dark?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“S’cool in here, Fang. Besides, man, this place is chill.” Thank you Reed, for your input. We could leave you in the freezer at Dino-Moe’s and you’d be alright as long as you had your Xrox.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah, Fang, it’s too hot to do anything outside.” Trish blew on her nails, now a brilliant share of golden yellow, complete with glitter. “I guess we could go to the beach again, but, like, I JUST did my nails. See? Aren’t they cute?!” Trish holds her completed work out to me, smiling. I manage to bite off the growl rising in my throat and give her a non-committal noise instead. I know she didn’t mean to on purpose, but sometimes the way Trish flaunted just how pretty she was made me fucking pissed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Thanks a lot you fucks, real great help here. Anon, can you back me up, dweeb?” He was my last desperate lifeline. If I could get him on board with the idea, the others would have no other choice but to tag along.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon stayed silent for a moment, his lips moving slightly. We all waited, glancing at him, accustomed to the way that stupid dweeb always thought out his words before saying anything. Sometimes, when he mumbled, it was like a precursor to the real thing, a warm-up act of stupidity before the real dipshit band took the stage.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“S’pose it wouldn’t be too bad to get out there.” The uncomfortable edge in his voice made me smile. Anon never took off his jacket, despite the fact that it was like, a million degrees outside right now. Summer was not kind to dweebs like him. “Sure, Fang, let’s do something!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yesssssssssss!” I couldn’t help myself from double-fist punching the sky, laughing as I nearly took out the stand lamp that sat next to the couch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Did you have something in mind, Fang?” Reed manage to pull himself away from the screen at last, immediately searching for what he called his ‘signature dish’. We all know it’s carfe, Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No beach! And I ain’t climbing the bluff again, not with these nails, nuh-uh.” We get it Trish, your nails look great. Bitch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon crossed the room, sitting next to me on the floor. I quickly pulled my phone to my chest, hiding the screen from him. “Yeah Fang, what have you been planning?” I could tell he suspected something, the way he was grinning. The butterflies in my stomach started to beat faster.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Damnit Anon, you and your stupid grin!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ummm, well…” I could feel my face blushing under their stares. Suddenly, the idea of a day in Dinoland sounded kinda’ lame, even to me. I mean, we just graduated high school! We should be out getting shit-faced on beer and shit, not going to an amusement park for little kids. I could feel myself start to spiral, palms sweaty as I hide my face. Would they even like the idea?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey, babe, it’s okay.” Anon placed a comforting hand on my knee. “Whatever you wanna do, I’m down for it.” This time, his smile was warm and reassuring, the same one that had comforted me through so much these past few months.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Damnit Anon!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Taking a deep breath, I pull my phone away from my chest, thumbing the password in. “Okay, this is gonna sound totally lame, but, I was think we could, maybe, go to… Dinoland?” The shocked expression on their faces made me stammer out my next bit like a frazzled little kid. “I mean, ironically, right? Like, who would wanna go to such a lame place? Hahaha!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed stroked his chin, his eyes already matching the color of his skin. “It could be kinda’ fun to sneak into one of those mascot costumes.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish blew an errant strand of curls out of her face, clearly nonplussed at my idea. “Yeah, maybe if we go just to see how lame it is.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon just smiled, reaching out for my hand. For a second we just sat there, holding each other, before he chimed in. “I think that’s a great idea, Fang. An ironic Dinoland road trip!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I gave Anon a smile, feeling my face begin to redden again. I knew he knew that I didn’t want to go there ironically at all, but I didn’t care. All that mattered to me is that we were going together.</div>
