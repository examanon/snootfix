Do you like what you see?" Lucy asked me tentatively</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The woman of my dreams was standing in the doorframe of the bathroom, too embarrassed to strip in front of me. She was still too embarrassed to strip at all, instead wearing a plain white nightgown. She might as well have, the ultra-thin fabric did nothing to hide her sinful body. modest breasts were bulging the loose silk, protruding nipples clearly betraying her arousal. The swell of her hips was just large enough to force the garment to hug them. The gown itself could barely be called such, it stopped halfway down her thighs teasing the pale skin beneath. Lucy rubbed her shoulder nervously, oh right, I was supposed to be answering a question instead of ogling her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Lucy, that's a silly question to ask." I smiled, patting the bed beside me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She took only a moment to steel her nerves before she made her way over to me one hesitant step at a time. Eventually taking a seat next to me, she still couldn't find it in her to look right at me. The poor girl was blushing up a storm, her normally pale cheeks were flushed a bright crimson that practically spilled across her snout. Yet despite how unsure she acted there was no denying the nervous smile she wore. I reached over and cupped her cheek, my lips meeting the other one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Because you're the most beautiful woman in Volcadera Bluff." I whispered in her ear</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That proved too much for her, she was forced to hide her face in her hands but even between her fingers I could see that blush only intensified. I couldn't help but chuckle at her, how is it even possible for someone to act this cute? With her face covered by her hands, my usual avenue for attack was blocked off. My lips traveled from her jaw down the smooth skin of her neck until they landed at the tender flesh where her neck met her shoulder. Lucy gasped as I teased her with my teeth, merely hinting at the possibility of a bite. I could feel her hand grasp the back of my head, urging me to continue. I had a better idea however and scooped her up in my arms.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Our eyes met for a brief moment, her cheeks were no less crimson than they were before but the bite of her lip begged me to continue. I planted a chaste kiss on the tip of her snout, causing her to giggle before I dropped her back on the bed. Lucy propped herself up on her elbows, an eager smile on her lips. she splayed her legs, inviting me between them. Before I could take her offer I noticed something that caught my breath. Despite the dim light of the room, through the shadow her gown cast, I could see the pale skin of her thigh traveled all the way up. No panties.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Should we really be doing this before marriage?" Lucy asked one last doubt on her mind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I won't tell if you won't. The wedding's in a month isn't it?" I answered her with a grin, discarding the last of my clothes and crawling between her legs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy smiled nervously, her eyes firmly locked on the member tenting the gown between her legs. Her eyes held equal parts anticipation and hesitation but when I rubbed against her moist slit, Lucy's true desire was clear. I slowly pulled her gown up her body until it was scrunched up around her stomach, baring her lower half to the world. My hand across the smooth skin of her thighs as they returned. I could feel myself throb, painfully as I stared at Lucy, my Lucy, fully exposed and ready for me. I leaned over her, our lips met and we finally joined our bodies as our souls did long ago. She moaned into my lips when I entered her, her talons scrabbling across my chest and shoulders. The pain of it making me growl, that was going to leave marks for sure. Our next kiss was ferocious as I pinned her arms to either side of her head, our fingers intertwining. I broke away from just a moment, my eyes traveling down her form to take in my prize.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy's face had remained flush, despite the fact that we had barely begun her chest was already heaving. Her wings were splayed out to either side of the bed, the tips of them sporadically twitching in arousal. The gown did nothing to hide the perfect curves of her body now, I twitched inside her when I saw where we were connected. A primal part of my brain whispered in my ear that I was so close to her womb, that I was an inch away from claiming this woman as my own. My eyes trailed back up her body until my gaze met Lucy's once again. Her half-lidded eyes were utterly lost to lust, she was silently begging for the same very same thing, lost in her own animal desire to be bred. There was no point holding back then was there? Unable to resist myself anymore I smashed my hips against hers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The two of us moaned, the sensation of being fully joined was far too much. The electric pleasure racing up my spine paused me briefly before I pulled my hips back, eager to continue. The first few thrusts were experimental, our bodies still learning each other but our passion was a quick teacher. With confident, powerful thrusts I crashed our hips together, the force of it sending Lucy's modest breasts bouncing in her gown. My wife to be looked more beautiful than ever with her eyes rolled halfway into her skull, lengthy tongue no longer contained within her snout. Despite how lost to pleasure she seemed, Lucy still managed to meet my hips with her own. Her body begging me to go deeper, harder, faster. I could feel myself nearing my limit and I forced myself to slow down, to savor the moment. Lucy seemed to recover now that our lovemaking was no longer so wild.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon..." She moaned, her eyes now locked to where our bodies met.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hm?" I mumbled, trying to catch my breath.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Would it... Could I... Be on top?" She asked, somehow managing to sound bashful asking that while I was still inside her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, of course." I nodded, rolling off her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The room was shockingly cold, at least compared to the sweltering furnace that was Lucy's insides. I lay on my back, watching Lucy's wings tremble slightly as she sat up straight. She was staring at my member, standing proudly and still coated with her juices. Something about the intensity in that stare spurred something within me, forcing me to thrust weakly at the air.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"A-any time, Lucy," I begged, so close to release.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I expected her to be embarrassed or to apologize, instead, Lucy straddled my hips and grasped by length before seating herself proudly upon it. The return to her warmth forced me to gasp, the shock of pleasure was nearly enough to make me cum then and there. Lucy rolled her hips experimentally, getting used to the new position. I groaned as her slick walls rubbed against me, god I wouldn't last much longer at this rate. She quickly found an angle to her liking and the room was soon filled with the lewd, wet, sounds of our hips clapping together. I bit my lip and looked away, desperate to hold on just a little longer. Lucy only quickened her pace, the most beautiful girl in the world was bouncing in my lap and I couldn't enjoy the sight!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh Anon!" Lucy moaned, her talons dug into my shoulder again. The pain making me gasp.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon..." Her voice had turned low, husky.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I couldn't respond, every bit of focus I could spare was lost on the pain as her nails dug into me. Lucy didn't seem to care that I didn't say anything, she continued moaning my name as her hips impossibly picked up speed. This was it, I couldn't hold out any longer, no man could. Just as I was about to give myself into the sweet release when something sharp and wet grasped me by the throat! It tightened almost painfully around the sensitive flesh and a switch within me flicked, whether it was beaten into me by the military or some animal instinct I flung the assailant off me. I somehow only briefly registered that it had to be Lucy to have bitten my neck but my body cared little as I forced her down, my hands grasped firmly around her own neck, forcing her back against the bed. I slowly regained my senses once her jaws were removed from my neck, my grip loosened almost imperceptibly when I was forced to moan. Fang's lower muscles were milking my cock while my hands were around her neck, was she cumming!? Both the thought and the sensations proved far too much for me, as close to the edge as I already was. My grip tightened around her neck unbidden as my hips thrust against her, desperate to spill my seed as far inside her as possible.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The high of my orgasm didn't last long, with the clarity gained my hands dropped away from her neck and I sat back, breathing heavily. I glanced down at my lover, her hair was an absolute mess and slick with sweat. Her white gown was nearly translucent and stuck to her breasts, doing little to hide them. I winced as I saw the red marks around her neck as well as the heaving of her chest as she fought to get the air that was denied her. Her legs were twitching with the aftermath of her own orgasm, her wings flapped weakly beneath her with unspent energy. Despite that, Lucy's expression was undoubtedly one of a very satisfied ptero.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That was..." I couldn't finish the sentence, breathing heavily as I was.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Amazing." Lucy finished for me, sounding no less exhausted.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The two of us spent a minute catching our breath, our worlds slowly returning to normal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh! Oh my goodness, dear! You're bleeding!" Lucy gasped, concern clear in her voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My hand reached for my collar bone and returned wet with my own blood, I hadn't even noticed. It couldn't have been that bad right? Lucy certainly thought otherwise, leaping off the bed to grab the first aid kit in the bathroom. She returned quickly with a cotton swab and started dabbing at the bite wound she inflicted, she seemed unaware of the fact that her iconic fang was tinged red.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So where do you want to meet my parents tomorrow? I was thinking TGI Fridays." Lucy mentioned absent-mindedly as she cleaned up the wound.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Meet her parents? The rapid heel-turn she took back into the lovely, doting fiancée after nearly tearing my jugular and cumming her brains out was a little too much for me to wrap my head around.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Was it always going to be like this?</div>
