                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Valentines Gift</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang, Samantha</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: SurpriseVisitor</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang and I recline into the couch, the plush cushions threatening to swallow us into the depths of dust and lost coins. The Aron household is quiet; the only noticeable noise was Samantha tittering about, always finding something to clean or straighten or put away wherever she says it belongs. Ripley was elsewhere, either in his office or in the garage working on something, and Naser was going to some fancy school for rocket surgery or brain science or whatever it was. Relaxing as it was, this wasn't exactly how I was expecting to spend today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You know, we could've been eating somewhere nice right about now," I mutter to Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And I told you, I'm not in the mood to go anywhere," she replies, pushing a strand of silver hair away from her face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I had reservations."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And you canceled them."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Only because you told me to!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That I did," she smirks. "Besides, I'm sure everywhere is packed, anyway. You put me in the middle of that many people and someone is going to get hurt."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay, point, but still, you think this is the best way to spend Valentine's day?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's not Valentine's day." I groan, throwing my head back as she stifles a chuckle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's Valentine's day weekend, close enough. Especially seeing as I'm almost certainly going to be busy tomorrow."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, well, you aren't busy now, so quit yammering and do a better job of cuddling your girlfriend," she says, hooking an arm around my neck and yanking me in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright, jeez, easy on the neck!" I playfully whine. Girlfriend, though, seems a little… outdated.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Aww, need me to kiss it better?" Without waiting for a response, she cranes her head over and flicks her tongue across my neck, eliciting a shiver.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Gah! Come on, you know I don't like you doing that with your mom around."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I know." She does it again, getting the same reaction. "That's why it's fun."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"One of these days I'm gonna find something 'fun' for you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And maybe one of these days my dad isn't gonna scare you shitless with a single glare." There's no winning here, is there? “No, there isn’t,” she responds to what was supposed to be an internal thought. “Now hush. I’m trying to enjoy the quiet.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Okay, I’ll shut up, no more talking from me.” Fang quizzically glances over with an eyebrow raised and a growing smirk. She knows I can’t possibly be serious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Alright,” she sighs. “Hand it over.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hand what over?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Nothing, I guess I was mistaken. On an unrelated note, remember that time I decked you into that crazy chick’s flowers?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Uh, the first time or the second time?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“That was supposed to be rhetorical, but if you need me to ‘kick’start your memory…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ooh, feeling particularly violent today, are we?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Now you’re just stalling.” A short staredown commences between us as I slowly reach for the little present I have in my jacket pocket. Sure, she was probably a lot better at these little games than I was, but I’ve got something that’ll tip the scales…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, I was planning on giving this to you during our romantic, candlelit dinner, complete with all the atmosphere and ambiance one could possibly hope for, but I suppose the couch in your living room will suffice.” Refusing to bounce back another statement and give me a little more time, Fang gives me no choice but to present my gift. Not that I don’t want to, but fuck me it’s taking a lot of willpower to keep myself from shaking to bits.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After stealing a few more precious seconds, I pull my hand out and open it in front of Fang, the box sitting in my palm, complete with a tiny ribbon and bow. Her expression softens and there’s a hint of mist in her eyes. I’m sure any actual surprise was tossed long ago when I mumbled something revealing without realizing it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Like you are now?” she whispers, not taking her eyes off of the box. Yeah. One of her hands cradles mine from beneath while the other flicks the bow on top. Her smile widens as she tugs and it gives way. And now for the finale…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang visibly twitches, her eyes almost bulging out of her sockets. For a few moments she’s completely still, then her gaze shifts downward.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Is… are you alright?” I ask worriedly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh… oh fuck…” is her only response.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Dear, we need to go!” I hear Samantha shout from elsewhere in the house. Wait, what? What’s-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I think my water just broke.”</div>
