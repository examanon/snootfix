                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Weird Customs</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang, Trish, Reed</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Anonymous</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">> It's an unusually chilly morning as I walk to school, hands tucked into my pockets</div><div class="fanfic-line">> There's hardly anybody loitering around the front steps today, clearly everyone rushed for the warm hallways</div><div class="fanfic-line">> As I walk up the front sidewalk, something in the grass catches my eye.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Leaning over and scooping it up, I see it's actually a small agate</div><div class="fanfic-line">> It's nothing special really, pretty small and unremarkable. It would probably sell for about a dollar in some dinky gift-shop somewhere.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I pocket it on a whim, barely giving it any thought as I walk inside</div><div class="fanfic-line">> As usual, Fang is waiting for me by my locker, tapping an improvised tune against the metal</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Morning dork." She yawns, snapping her jaws.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Sup Fang." I reply, reaching into my pocket, "Hey check out what I just found."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I toss the agate to Fang, who easily catches it. She turns it over in the light, wiping off the dirt with her thumb</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Nice find dweeb, you thinking of becoming a geologist?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Yeah yeah, whatever." I scoff, grabbing my bag from my locker, "I just found it outside on the lawn. You want it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Fang gasps, fumbling and nearly dropping the rock. She stares at me wide eyed, a crimson blush spreading over her face</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Fang? You alright?" I ask, confused. Is something wrong with her? Does she have a fever?</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Y-yeah! I'm fine!" Fang nearly shouts, smiling nervously. "Are you really sure you want me to have it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Sure, why not?" I shrug, slinging my bag over my shoulder. "I can keep it if you don't want it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "No!" Fang snaps, clasping the stone tightly to her chest as if it's the most precious thing in the world. "I mean, uh... sure. I'll take it off you hands, it's fine."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Oookay then..." I reply suspiciously. I don't know what's going on with Fang today, she's definitely acting weird.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Anyway, I'll see you later at science class." I wave as I head off, the first bell of the day ringing overhead. Fang meekly waves back, retreating beneath her wings as they fold over her head</div><div class="fanfic-line">> From a distance, I can just barely hear a muffled "EEEEEE!!!" from beneath her feathers as I turn around the corner.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Huh, wonder what all that was about. Maybe I can ask Reed about it later, see if she got sick over the weekend or something. Oh well, I'm sure it's nothing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">> It's finally the end of the week, and everyone is eager to finally go home for the weekend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Stepping down the school's concrete steps, I fish out my phone and get check my favorite Indonesian pickle shearing forum. As usual, there's nothing interesting going on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> My feet are on autopilot as I walk down the sidewalk, and I nearly stumble into someone standing in my way</div><div class="fanfic-line">> It's a pterosaur who's name I can't quite recall. I recognize her from some of my classes however. We've never really talked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> She's shorter than Fang, but not quite so thin. Much more colorful though. She always seemed particularly shy, and honestly she's pretty cute.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Uh, h-hey Anon." she stammers, running her hand through her hair, "I was wondering, um-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Oh great, what is this going to be? Some stupid question about humans? Somebody trying to get answers about Fang?</div><div class="fanfic-line">> She mentally psyches herself up, slapping her cheeks and straightening her back</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Reaching into her bag, she quickly pulls something out and thrusts it to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> It's a stick. Admittedly, a pretty nice stick, but still a stick.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> She clearly want me to have it, so I reluctantly take it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Is this some stupid caveman thing? Is this racist? Was she put up to this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Suddenly, she starts strutting back and forth in front of me, puffing out her chest while bobbing her head forward and back</div><div class="fanfic-line">> ...What?</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Dude, what the fuck am I looking at?</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Everyone on the front lawn is staring, or excitedly whispering to each other as she continues the display.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> The mystery pterosaur stops strutting and starts scraping her feet against the ground, fluffing and flapping her wings wildly</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I have no idea what the fuck is happening</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Is this some kind of prank?</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Am I getting punked?</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Does Volcano High have an interpretive dance troupe?</div><div class="fanfic-line">> This is all so totally fucking bizarre I can't even think. I just stand there slack-jawed, stick in hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Suddenly Fang storms up from behind me, roughly shoving me behind her and slapping the stick out of my hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">> She looks absolutely livid. Her feathers are all standing on end, her wings fully extended as she bares her teeth at the other dino</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Fang takes a deep breath, her chest visibly filling with air</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "**SKREE-ONK!!**"</div><div class="fanfic-line">> What the fuck</div><div class="fanfic-line">> This day is just too fucking weird for me. I just want to go home.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> The shorter pterosaur looks absolutely terrified, visibly quailing under Fang's murderous glare</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Stammering out a rapid apology, she literally sprints off across the lawn and out of sight</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Fang calms down slightly, but she's still clearly agitated, her wings refusing to come down to rest completely</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Without a word she possessively wraps her arm around mine, pulling me to her side</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Holding her head up high but refusing to look at me, Fang nearly drags me down the sidewalk past the crowd of whispering students</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I'm too fucking baffled to object, my fried brain content to just be lead wherever Fang intends to go</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Finally, about a block away, I remember how words work</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Fang, what the fuck was that?" I ask, trying and failing to escape form Fang's iron grip</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Nothing dork, don't worry about it." Fang replies, pulling me in tighter. She still won't look at me, although I can faintly hear Fang mumbling.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Fucking skank, thinks she can't just walk up and-..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">> It's another typical lunch break at Volcano High, sitting with the Fang Gang at our usual spot</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Trish, Reed, and Fang are all excitedly talking about their next upcoming show, debating lightning and the possibility of pyrotechnics</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I don't have much to contribute, and today I'm lost in thought. Something has been bugging me for a while now, and I can't get my mind off it</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I absentmindedly push my food around, trying to think things through and tuning out the world around me</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Hey, Earth to Anon? You in there?" Fang asks, elbowing my side, "You okay dude? You've been mumbling nonstop."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Yeah, I'm good. Just got something on my mind." I answer, "It's probably nothing."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "What's up dude? You can tell us." Reed chimes in, Trish clearly annoyed at the interruption</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Well, it's kind of weird..." I scratch the back of my head, knowing how strange this will all sound, "I think there's a stray cat or something in my apartment building."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Everyone is just staring, waiting for me to continue. With a sigh, I decide to just lay it all out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "It started a couple weeks ago." I explain, "I got up and found a big stick on my front mat. I didn't think anything of it, but every couple days another shows up."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "You found... a stick." Trish deadpans, her eyes narrowing dangerously</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Yeah, and not just sticks." I continue, "Sometimes it's big colored rocks, or blankets, a couple pillows, old bed stuffing, all kinds of stuff."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Dude, a cat couldn't do that." Reed counters, "Unless it was like, a big cougar or something."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "I think I would have noticed that." I reply, "But what else could it be? It's too strange to be a prank or a threat."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "I don't know man, I'm stumped." Reed admits, leaning back into his seat, "You have any ideas Trish?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Nope." Trish spits out through clenched teeth, her claws scraping against the table, "What about you Fang?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Huh? N-no" Fang stammers, apparently more interested in something stuck on the ceiling, "I've got no idea what's going on."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Well, whatever." I shrug, focusing back on my cold lunch, "I guess it's not really a problem. It'll probably stop eventually."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> The four of us eat in relative silence, content with just each other's company. Fang though seems distracted now, barely picking at her food.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "So..." she hesitantly begins, trying to sound casual, "What did you end up doing with that stuff anyway?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "I just tossed most of it." I answer honestly, Fang's wings and shoulders visibly drooping. A brief flash of sadness on her face is quickly covered up by a fake smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Although..." I continue after another bite of food, "I did end up keeping most of the pillows and blankets."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Really?" Fang asks hopefully, her mood completely turning around in an instant</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Yeah, my old bed was a piece of shit." I explain, "Now it's probably the comfiest place on Skin Row."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Oh, good!" Fang smiles, her tail thumping happily against her seat. I'm not sure why she's so concerned about my sleeping arrangements, but it's nice to see her so happy</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Still no idea where all that stuff came from though, it's quite the mystery.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">> It's late in the evening as I come home from work, several heavy bags of groceries in my arms</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I struggle with the paper bags as I fumble with the front door to my new home, a little two bedroom townhouse I moved into with Fang last year</div><div class="fanfic-line">> It feels like we still moving in even after all these months, but I'm starting to recognize it as home, not just some stranger's house I'm sleeping in</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Hey Fang, I'm home!" I call out at I kick the door closed behind me. There's no answer, which isn't that unusual. Fang probably just has her headphones on or something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> As I walk into the living room though, I notice something is wrong. The couch is pushed askew, all the cushions and pillows missing</div><div class="fanfic-line">> At first I fear we've been robbed, my thoughts immediately jumping to Fang's safety, but then I notice the TV is still here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> No, nothing valuable is missing, just all the couch cushions and blankets. Oh, now I know what's going on. It finally happened.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I head into the kitchen, dropping the heavy paper bags onto the counter. It's amazing how much food two people can go through, especially in these last couple months</div><div class="fanfic-line">> The food can get put away later, I need to find Fang. I head down the hallway and into the bedroom, fairly sure I know where to find her</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Just as I suspected, the bedroom is in a similar state as the living room. The mattress has been flipped over, stripped off all it's sheets and pillows.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I don't have to look in the bathroom to know all the towels have been ransacked as well</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I head to the walk-in closet, slowly pushing the creaky door open</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Hey Fang, you in here?" I gently call out, flipping on the light</div><div class="fanfic-line">> In the center of the closet is a massive pile of pillows, blankets, towels, and every other soft item collected from the entire house.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Looks like some of my shirts are in there as well, along with my old jacket</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Something shifts deep within the pile, the tiny tip of Fang's tail poking out the backside</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Mhmm..." Fang replies, unwilling to climb out. It's not hard to imagine the mortified blush on her face</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I bite my lip, fighting down laughter. She has to be embarrassed enough already, it would be too much to start teasing her</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Do you want to come out?" I ask, trying to keep my voice from cracking. Fang's only response is top burrow deeper into the pile, her tail slipping back inside</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I stand up to leave, partly so I don't burst out laughing. We both knew this would happen eventually, honestly I'm surprised she restrained herself for so long</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Heading back into the kitchen, I start rummaging through the groceries. I grab one of the bags of dino-nuggets, storing the other five in the freezer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I toss about a dozen nuggets on a plate and set them in the microwave, putting away the rest of the groceries while they cook</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Once the nuggets are cooked just the way I know Fang likes them, I carry the plate back into the bedroom closet</div><div class="fanfic-line">> She must have been able to smell them from across the house. The tip of her snout is pushed out from under the blankets as she audibly sniffs the air</div><div class="fanfic-line">> "Hey Fang." I coo, once again trying desperately to not laugh, "You want some food?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">> She hesitates, no doubt weighing the indignity of being fed against her instinctive desire for food. Finally she relents, wordlessly opening her snout</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I gingerly move a nugget to her between my fingers, Fang snapping it up like a crocodile once it's within reach.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> She chews it ravenously, swallowing it down and immediately awaiting more. I grab another, careful to keep my fingers away form those sharp teeth</div><div class="fanfic-line">> As I feed her, I can't help but pull out my phone and start recording this. This is just too good, it's like feeding a shy raccoon. I definitely need to send Trish the video later.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Fang will no doubt get her revenge on me later for this, but it'll be worth it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Once I run out of nuggets and Fang realizes there no more, she retreats back into her nest. I stand up and wipe the crumbs off my fingers, switching off the light as I leave</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I head downstairs and into the laundry room, which predictably has been instinctively pillaged along with the rest of the house</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Luckily, I've prepared for this day. The doctor we've been seeing warned me this would happen while Fang was out of earshot</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Sliding one of the ceiling panels away, I grab the duffel back I had stashed away about a month ago. Inside is a sleeping bag, and a couple sets of clothes</div><div class="fanfic-line">> It won't be comfy, but it'll be better than sleeping on the bare floor. Should be enough to get me through the final month or so until the delivery.</div>
