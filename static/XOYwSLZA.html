Anon retreat to Anon’s apartment to get some peace</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang still tosses her tantrum upon finding out what Naomi did</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Only this time, Anon takes his scolding further, and he realizes what a lost cause Fang really is</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon realizes that it’s all Fang’s fault</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That he wouldn’t be feeling what he now feels nor enduring all the grief he has if it hadn’t been for her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All he wanted was peace and quiet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>To disappear</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Instead, he was doxxed and humiliated</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He was made the pawn of some machiavellian bitch</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He wound up dating a psycho schizo who wouldn’t even settle on the gender she was clearly born as</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No more</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon tears into Fang mercilessly,

Ring 2</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The next morning Fang isn't at school</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She never went home either</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A day passes by, and Fang is still completely missing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The police are finally brought in</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Intially, they pin Anon down as a potential perp for abducting or doing something to Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley personally takes charge of the interrogation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After a whole day of questioning, however, he comes to realize that Anon truly doesn't know anything about his daughter’s sudden disappearance</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She's just gone and nobody can find her…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon can’t help but feel like shit for how things turned out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But not much he can do</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Life gradually returns to normal</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Graduation comes and goes uneventfully</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon retreats to his apartment and stays holed up inside despite all the attempts to get him to come out by Rosa and Stella and Reed and Trish</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Eventually, they give up on Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They begin to move on…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A month later, Anon prepares himself for his army deployment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>While boarding the bus he sees a ptero who looks eerily like Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He can't believe his eyes, but something in his heart tells him it's her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Gets off his bus and effectively deserts, going so far as to punch the CO aboard the bus</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Carefully follows Fang through town, but he loses her a couple of times</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Eventually, Fang’s tracks lead Anon into a neighborhood he's only visited once before with Naser</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It’s where Naomi lives</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi’s house looks normal enough from the outside</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But there's a window ajar</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As Anon gets closer, he hears the sounds of a struggle coming from inside the house</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Despite his every instinct telling him that it’s a stupid idea, Anon calls Ripley, tells him he saw Fang break into Naomi’s house, and hangs up before Ripley can get further confirmation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He then kicks down the front door and rushes upstairs and towards the sound of the struggle</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ends up coming up to Naomi’s room, where Fang is holding Naomi at gunpoint</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The two are temporarily shocked to see Anon there, Fang turning the gun towards Anon for a brief second, all the while demanding to know what he’s doing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon asks Fang the same question</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang openly admits she plans to kill Naomi for ruining her life</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon carefully convinces Fang to put down the gun and calm down</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This only makes Fang all the more irate</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After a bit more talking, Fang lets out a sigh and does put the gun down</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She turns to Naomi and she asks if she has anything to say for herself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon makes a hand motion towards Naomi without Fang noticing, telling her to oblige the ptero</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With a sigh, Naomi decides to express herself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon and Fang learn about Naomi in much the same way that Fang does in the extra chapter</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon sympathizes with Naomi after hearing why she did what she did and the pressure she was really under</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Also discovers that the stress of his sister’s vanishing, plus her general controlling nature, led Naser to dump Naomi pretty harshly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang doesn't sympathize with Naomi any, however, and instead takes the opportunity to bring up the gun again to shoot Naomi…</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naomi in the head</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang then, in a rage, hits Anon across the face with the pistol</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As Anon falls to the ground, he pleads with Fang and asks her why</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang only looks at Anon with bitterness in her eyes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You were right. It doesn't matter," is her only reply</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Drops the gun on him and escapes the house</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When the police arrive they take Anon into custody</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley, convinced that Anon planned to pit Naomi’s murder on his daughter, tosses the book on him and has him arrested for the Murder of Naomi</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When the trial comes, the prosecutor is easily able to pin the murder on Anon, both because of the situation in which Naomi was killed, as well as the fact that Anon is a ‘skinnie’</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As a result, he spends the next twenty years in prison</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Twenty years later, Anon leaves prison to a world he does not recognize</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His parents have long passed on, leaving him with no family</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He doesn't have a single friend in or out of prison, and the ones he once had had long ago been convinced he was a murderer</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon now fears and resents the world around him that's changed so much</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yet all he can think about even now is Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He isn't sure if he'd kill her or just ask her why she did what she did</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But they never found Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In a twisted way, he got what he wished in the end and became wholly invisible</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With a bitter smile, Anon takes a cigarette out of a smuggled pack and takes a long drag</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“It really doesn't matter,” he whispers to no one</div>
