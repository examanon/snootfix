What's the fun in getting fucked up on something that's not 30% cologne, anyway?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Getting closer to the porch, I notice a group of familiarly seizure-inducing baseball team mascots.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish, Reed, Naomi, Naser and, of course, her were actively discussing something right in front of my home right until I showed up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now, they're all just looking at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Me and a bottle of liver cirrhosis I've had in my hand. Probably should've put it in a plastic bag or something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Guess it's up to me to break the silence this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon: "Uh... Busted?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Smooth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I would've probably cringe'd my colon out if I still had a care about not dropping pasta in front of anyone from that goddamn school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naomi: "No-no-no, do not worry Anon. Neither Principal •Spears nor anyone else from Volcano High will know about this, I promise."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh goody, the worst possible scenario averted. Now all that's left is to deal with the runner-up that's right in front of me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wait, did I just took her word on faith?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Whatever. It doesn't matter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon: "So. what's with a social call, then?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser: "This... Is not a social call."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon: "Good, 'cause I'm not sharing."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After passing through the crowd and making sure not to lock eyes with her, I open the main door and, before I can slip back into the safety of my sanctum, get stopped by a suprisingly muscular pink hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed: "Dude, we need to talk. Let us in."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon: "And what would the subject be, I wonder?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>C'mon, surprise me. Couldn't possibly be the world's single most "not the only person".</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish: "It's... us, Anon. The way we've been treating each other."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon: "...Goaded them into the group session, huh Fang?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The last unwelcome guest can only shuffle around behind my back to confirm that the words have reached her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Good.

Again, I'm not sharing, so the best you can hope for is some tea."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I open the door and the Sour Patch Crew one by one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...Maybe it's good that they showed up all together like that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was a long time coming anyway.</div>
