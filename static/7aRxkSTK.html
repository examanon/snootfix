                <div class="fanfic-text">
                    <div class="fanfic-line">It's been several years since I've stepped down as Volcano High's principal and let Anon take my place: I am getting pretty old after all so I needed a successor and a good one at that. I think that I've made the right choice choosing Anon: sure he may have shit taste in anime, but I'm convinced that he became better. He even became a sound engineer as far as I know, so good for him. I wonder how he's doing as the principal... Maybe I could pay a visit, just to check up on him and see how it's going.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">«The next day...»</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So here I am, at Volcano High, once again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I look at the school, memories start to flow, especially about this particular student that really stood out, and of course, I'm talking about Anon: he was the only human at school at the time I was the principal as he had to be transferred here from his previous school due to excessive bullying.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hmm... It hasn't changed that much since I last worked here, it feels so nostalgic walking around here...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And while I was walking I spotted Anon, with his generic, yet indistinguishable face, together with a pterodactyl.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, long time no see, Anon, Lucy!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wha-? Oh! Principal Spears! I didn't expect you to come here!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hi Mr. Spears, it sure is a surprise to see you here at Volcano High."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hello you two, it seems that both of you are doing just fine. And please, Anon, you can just call me Spears, you are the new principal after all."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah you are right: it has been an instinctive action. So, what's the occasion for your visit?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, I just wanted to see how you were doing: since I gave you the role of the principal of this school I wondered how things were going... And it seems that you are all of this just fine."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yes, everything is going steady. Well, almost. There are still some students that do not accept the fact that their principal is a human instead of one of their kin, sadly."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Perhaps they are jealous that you are married to me, a dinosaur, wouldn't you think so?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, that's probably it. Or maybe not, hehe."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As we were chatting we heard a scream coming from the entrance of Volcano High. We rush towards the exit to see a teenage girl, standing on the edge of the rooftop, ready to jump to oblivion at any second, not even a second later and I see Anon sprinting towards the high school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Lucy! Make sure to keep an eye on her and the students so that all of them do not lose composure! I'm going upstairs!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh no, this wasn't expected at all. Please Raptor Jesus make sure that Anon manages to handle this situation correctly. Please for the love of God...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This has been one of the few times that I felt scared, and yet both Anon and Lucy remained calm as both of them tried their best to make sure that the situation didn't escalate further.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No! This is not the time for getting lost in my thoughts: I must retain my composure like I always do and help Anon and Lucy manage the situation as best as I can, exactly like when I was the principal of this school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Several minutes pass before I can breathe a sigh of relief seeing the girl stepping down from the edge of the roof. *Phew*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"He's pretty great, isn't he?" Lucy says.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, I wonder how he managed to convince the girl to not jump from the roof."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We see Anon coming out from the entrance when two voices could be heard getting louder: two dinos rushing towards the girl on the verge of tears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Emily! Oh, thank Raptor Jesus you are fine!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mom, Dad, I'm s-sorry! I was scared! I didn't know what to do! I didn't have anyone to talk to!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What is this teen talking about I wonder? What could have pushed her so far as almost committing suicide?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She told me that she was getting bullied by other girls because she wasn't popular enough: basically a sort of punching bag, or so to speak," said Anon with a visibly preoccupied expression. "Why didn't you tell the Principal, me, or your parents immediately? We could have helped you." Lucy explained to the teen in the verge of tears, trying to compose herself, to no avail.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I-it's because I wasn't sure that you could have helped me! I-I'm so-sorry..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then Anon came closer to the girl, started caressing her head, speaking to her in a compassionate tone: "Ok, now that you told me why you were trying to jump off the roof, I can help you resolve the problem. I'll make sure that they will not bully you by taking the appropriate measures: such behavior will not be tolerated. You should really go home and rest at least for today, it must have been hard to endure all of that, but do not worry. Now you are safe with us."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She then hugged her to reassure her and sent her home.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I never expected Anon, the one that originally hated this place and was so dejected with life improved so much. And yet, he has proven me otherwise.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Good thing that everything went fine, right dweeb?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"*Phew* I swear I was shitting myself up there with that girl almost jumping down the edge!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, I never expected you to become like this, you have really changed for the better, I'm so proud of you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Thanks, Spears! I just did what every good samaritan would have to."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, I shall return home now, I just wanted to drop in to check up on you: but it seems that I do not need to worry. If you need help and advice in quality anime, you can call me anytime Anon."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Thanks, Spears! See you soon!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wave my hand to the couple and I start heading home, thinking about what happened today and how Anon managed to avoid a huge tragedy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Looking back at what happened I remembered when I gave Anon the role of principal: I thought that even if he changed he could have not handled such situations which, while they are rare, are not improbable… But he demonstrated that he could handle it just fine, better than I’ve expected to be frank.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’m happy that I’ve made the right choice with him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Best of luck to both of you, Anon and Lucy.</div>
