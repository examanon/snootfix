There is only one problem... the stegosaur is willing to do anything to keep loving her human...        Anything...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Kind of a boring morning today</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Then again, it's the first day back from our mid-semester break, so of course, things are going to be boring</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh Wow</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Only six months left of school and then I graduate</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Who would've thought I'd make it this far in Volcano High?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not many others did judging by the looks they give me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It could also be my 'reputation' proceeding me again</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I’m a tough bitch, that much no one denies</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I dress tough, and can more than back up it up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But as much as I've tried to dispel the stigma, I'm still that weirdo stego chick that loves Anime and the occult</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There's also the more insidious accusation that I'm a homewrecker...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I honestly don't know where that got started from</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well, okay... maybe I do know...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But how was I supposed to know that one guy I wanted to bang was already seeing another chick?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That girl really pissed me off too, what with how smug and superior she went around acting just because her dad's a big-shot rock star…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The last straw was her making up that bull rumor that I went around sucking cock for money on top of the school roof!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh, I wanted to beat her up so bad on the spot</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But I came up with a better solution</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A ‘cleaner’ solution…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'm still shocked how easy it was to stage her 'accident'</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Though I kinda ended shooting myself in the foot with it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her BF dumping her now crippled ass really should've clued me into what kind of asshole he really was</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Literally made it impossible to bear him for more than a few minutes at a time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Good thing I ended up arranging for another 'accident' to happen to him by the front stairs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Apparently, he's still down in the hospital in a full-body cast eating through a straw</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Good riddance I say</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No one's really missing his ass</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And there she goes, rolling down the hall looking all happy and carefree, almost like her current situation's some kind of improvement</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Kinda pisses me off that getting stuck to that wheelchair somehow made her life better</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not only did she lose that scumbag of an ex, but her father also started paying more attention to her, and she now gets all kinds of pity privileges to boot!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Remind me of this one anime where the MCs lost their bodies but got magical power in return</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No wait, I'm confusing it for that one comic where this chick gets shot in the spine and winds up in a wheelchair but that somehow makes her smarter and more beloved by her peers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well, it doesn't matter</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What matters is that the whole fiasco left me with a bad rep, and now there ain’t a guy that wants to touch me if he can manage it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>So much for losing my virginity before graduation…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well, I spoke to Rosa about club business, as well as how she enjoyed her winter break</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She's probably my only real friend in all of Volcaldera Bluffs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Helps that we are both the heads of the Gardening Club</div><div class="fanfic-line">>We’re also roommates, sharing the same general school dorms</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I think the fact that we’re roomie’s the only reason we even are friends</div><div class="fanfic-line">>God knows it’s not because we share similar outlooks on school life</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yeah, she knows about the rumors and knows about my… violent tendencies…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She scolds me as if she was my big sister, but otherwise accepts me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If nothing else because she thinks she can help me walk the ‘right’ path in life</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Rosa’s… too good a friend for someone like me…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well, that’s enough self-wallowing!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I start making my way down the hallways, not really caring about my surroundings</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Instead, I turn my thoughts to last night's showing of Rebuild of Evangelion 3.33 + 01</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What a mouthful of a title</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I still can't believe that Hideaki, the absolute madman, managed to pull off a happy ending for the series!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Gives me some hope that if even pathetic Shinji can get a happy ending, so can I…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I look around and spot something new and exciting</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Much to my surprise, it's a human</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A human? Now that's something new…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>We don’t get many humans around Volcano High</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Only humans I can think of off the top of my head are Mr. Carldelewski and Principal Spears</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What’s this new skinnie doing here this late in the semester?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A transfer student, maybe?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well, whatever the reason he’s here, it’s someone brand new and untainted by my reputation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Time for me to go make a new friend!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I pretend not to pay attention as I walk down the hall and directly into the human’s path</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Right before he subconsciously moves out of my way, I step in the same direction he's heading</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The two of us end up running right into each other</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Somehow, the human’s the only of the two of us who winds up falling on the ground</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Judging by his mass, he isn't exactly bulky</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Pretty lanky, actually</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Good</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This will make things so much easier moving forward!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I lean down and give the newcomer to Volcano High a wide toothy smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh wow! A Real human! Imagine bumping into you, right here, in the hallway! What a TOTAL coincidence!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>'Just according to keikaku,' I think to myself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>'Keikaku’ means plan, by the by…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Two weeks since I first met Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He’s still having a hard time trying to fit into Volcano High, but I’m doing my best to help him feel at home</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Of course, that means I also have to compete with a few other interested parties</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Rosa comes to mind</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She views the human with a vested interest, if nothing else because she also wants to help him fit in</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There’s also this orange ptero that’s obsessed with sticks</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yeah, don’t really know about that one either</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But the one party that surprises me the most is our Class President, Naomi</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi… that bitch…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For some reason, she’s grown REAL fixated with Anon, and I don’t really know why</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She should know better though</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She’s cutting into MY territory!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh look, here she comes now…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Probably coming over to tell me about how I’m obstructing some machiavellian scheme of hers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was probably the one to suggest Anon get transferred over to our school to win us diversity points or something</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was true…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She walks up to me with a certain swagger to her step</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Stella, we need to talk,” she says, all the while grimacing</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Oh?” I ask, already imagining just what she can possibly want from me</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Lately, you’ve been really friendly with Anon Y Mous, have you not?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I cross my arms and raise an eyebrow</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “So what if I have? What’s it to you?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi removes her glasses and wipes them clean on a handkerchief she carries around in her pocket</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I’m only going to say this once. Back off and walk away”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “And why should I do that?” I ask, already gritting my teeth in rage</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Because I have plans for him. That’s all you need to know…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi and her fucking ‘plans’</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If it’s not one thing, it’s another with her… and it pisses me off to no end</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I’ll do whatever I want with Anon,” I snap, taking a step forward, all the while glaring daggers at Naomi</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi lets out a chuckle and gives me an ominous grin</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “You’re really going to stand in the way of my plans? You do realize that I could destroy your reputation by revealing what you did to that poor girl and her boyfriend, don’t you?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I give Naomi a chuckle of my own</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “And you do realize that I could destroy YOUR reputation by letting it slip that you were the one to sweep it all under the rug to keep our school’s ‘pristine’ reputation intact. Oh, and let’s not forget about the little ‘voter fraud’ thing that lets you stay as class president for four years running, or that you often orchestrate little ‘accidents’ of your own to happen to your running opposition...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I take a step forward and give Naomi a malicious grin of my own</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Alternatively, you could suffer from a ‘terrible accident’ yourself…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi goes a bit white at my words, but she surprises me by clearing her throat and suddenly looking disinterested</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I see we aren’t going to come to an agreement…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I cross my arms and scoff</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi gives me a hateful glare as she sighs</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Very well then. I’ll… adjust my plans accordingly…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She points an accusatory finger at my face</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “But you better not do anything else to jeopardize my plans or this school’s reputation, got it!?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I roll my eyes and pat Naomi’s hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Yeah, yeah. I’ll keep my shit on the down-low. Make this last year go by nice and easy for all of us…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Naomi gives me an uneasy look, but she seems to relent on her thoughts as she turns around and clears her throat again</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Well, that was everything. Carry on like normal”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> I feel another grin form on my lips</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Hey, before you go… how about a tarot reading?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Before Naomi can object, I pull out my trusty Tarot deck, which I conveniently keep tucked within my breasts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As I open the tin case, I’m very careful with the metallic cards, which I keep the edges of sharpened</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Totally just in case and for no other reason at all…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I carefully shuffle the cards and draw out the topmost card</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It’s the upright devil</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I show it to Naomi, whose face goes white again</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Before I can give the pink tyrant her reading, she lets out a huff and walks away at a brisk pace</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I guffaw as I put the card back into the deck, very eager to see what kind of entrapment Naomi was about to get herself stuck into...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>My thoughts also turn towards Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It’s been a few minutes since I last saw him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Really hope he hasn’t gotten himself into some kind of trouble without me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Really, he can be so helpless</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But that’s also kinda cute too…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's been about a month since I met Anon, the new human transfer student to Volcano High</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Since that time, we've become nigh inseparable friends</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Or so he claims to everyone else</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In truth, he's basically mine and mine alone…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>How can he not be mine?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I hold his hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I cuddle with him when he least expects it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I nibble on his ear until he tells me to stop it with a giggle</div><div class="fanfic-line">>We are dating in every sense of the word except for admitting it out-loud</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And it couldn't be any more perfect!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Turns out that Anon is just as big an anime nerd as I am</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He's got this thing for Saturnia</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Kinda pleb taste if you ask me, but it's at least better than Rosa's love for DBZ</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I mean, DBZ? That's as basic bitch as you can get!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Everyone knows that Saint Seiya's much better</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well, whatever</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'll introduce Rosa to the glory that's Saint Siya one day soon…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Back to Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He has this habit, one I don’t think he even knows about</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He mumbles, and he mumbles a lot</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Mumbles about a lot of things, but it’s usually about his innermost thoughts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>because of that, I know a lot more about him than most others</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe more than he knows himself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I know that something horrible happened at his old school</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Something that forced him to transfer to Volcano High</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No matter how much I try to prod it out of him, he won’t mumble just what exactly happened, only that it was bad enough for him to seek a new start somewhere else</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Kinda makes me feel bad for him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I do wonder what his old school was like though</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Was it really so bad?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I don’t care what it was that Anon did. I still like him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Besides, it can’t be as bad as all the shit I’ve pulled over the years</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That no one’s wound up dead yet is kind of a small miracle, really…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>So there we are walking down the hall when who else but Trish comes barreling down and starts shouting into my bee eef's face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She says something about him 'insulting' fang during science class</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I roll my eyes, already well aware of what Trish is going on about</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her friend goes by Fang nowadays. Used to call herself Lucy, but after Trish fed her some bullshit about non-binarism, her mind went all schizo</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Lucy already had a lot of problems to start with, what with the whole brother crippling thing and serious bitchy attitude, but Trish's whole thing sure as hell didn't make things any better</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And now Trish is screaming into my boyfriend's face over some stupid bull that he couldn't know or care about</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I can’t fucking BELIEVE you, you fucking skinnie! How can you be such a bigot!?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Look, I’m sorry if I insulted Fang, alright. How was I supposed to know that she—”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “THEY!” Trish shouts back in a rage, all the while poking Anon in the shoulder</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “IT’S THEY!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Whatever!” Anon retorts, slapping Trish’s hand away and pointing his own finger into the purple trigger’s face</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I don’t give a fuck what ‘they’ think they are. If they really are that insulted by my words, then so be it, but I already apologized to ‘them,’ and that’s where I’m ending this story.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish’s face only gets redder with rage as her whole tiny body begins to shake</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Serious, who does she think she is? Acting all high and mighty? Accusing my boo of being a bigot when he's done nothing but keep his perfect nose clean?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I decide to stand in the way of her fury</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All for Anon’s sake…</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Trish, what are you going on about now?” I ask the trig in a barely restrained voice</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I’m doing my part to make sure justice is done!” she shouts, shoving me out of the way and punching Anon on the chest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It doesn’t really do much, as expected forms someone as tiny as Trish, but the fact that she dared to even TOUCH my boyfriend...</div><div class="fanfic-line">> 'That's my Anon you just fucked with...' I internally seethe as I stand between her and MY boyfriend and give her the best-forced smile I can manage</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I'm sure Anon didn’t mean anything by what he said to Fang”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “A simple slip of the tongue!" I giggle, just barely able to hold back my bubbling rage</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Y-yeah!” Anon adds, all the while rubbing the back of his head</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “It was completely accidental… not like that one time I laughed at Fang’s concer—”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Anon shuts his mouth and takes a step back his eyes going wide with horror</div><div class="fanfic-line">> Trish’s own eyes bulge out of their sockets as she bears her teeth</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “You did WHAT!?” she shouts, tackling Anon to the ground and launching blow after blow at Anon’s face</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I-I’m sorry!” Anon shouts back, all the while putting up his arms to defend himself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I grab Trish by her sweater’s hood and toss her off Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish glares daggers at both me and Anon as she points an accusatory finger at the two of us</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I swear, this shit AIN’T over yet!” she shouts before storming off in a rage</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I instantly look over Anon for any injuries</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As expected, he has a few scratches and a growing bruise on his face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I wrap my arms around him and give him the tightest hug I can manage, all the while seething over at what Trish had just dared to do…</div><div class="fanfic-line">> ‘I gotta make that bitch pay. She’s a danger to Anon as long as she’s around…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Then it hits me, the perfect way to get back at Trish AND also make sure she's no longer a problem for both Anon and the school</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I close my eyes and lose myself in the hug I’m giving Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All the while I set my plan into stone…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'm now in some dingy alleyway, garbed in a hoodie and a pair of shades</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I look around wondering if anyone can recognize me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'm a bit  more worried about cops though</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If they happen to show up, its fucking game over</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I hear someone clear their voice</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I turn and came face to face with a guy in a black hoodie and medical face mask</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You got the money?" He asks bluntly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You got the shit?" I retort also just as bluntly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He produces a bag of white powder</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I grin as I produce a wad of cash</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Damn... hurts to part with the money I’d been saving up to buy that one limited edition figure of Gurren Lagann, but this is for a good cause...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...Yeah… a good cause…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The next morning, the police storms the campus after an 'anonymous' call went out about a student dealing cocaine</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Everyone assumes that it was Reed's time to face the music</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What no one expected was the day to end with Trish, screaming and cursing as loud and hard as she had ever before, being led out in handcuffs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Everyone watches in shock at the scene</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even Anon, who was at the receiving end of Trish’s beatdown, can’t believe what he’s seeing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Meanwhile, I'm trying my hardest to keep from bursting out laughing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>'Serves you right for fucking with my boyfriend, you bitch...'</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Eventually, the scene clears up, and everyone goes their way</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Among the dispersing crowd, I spot Naomi talking with Principal Spears</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears looks… troubled</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Can’t blame him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The school’s probably going to be on the news soon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No one wants this kind of bad publicity</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For just a second, I feel bad over what I did</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But that feeling soon passes as I tell myself that Trish would have eventually done something to get the school into the news anyway</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Girl was only one bad day away from shooting up the place if her attitude was anything to go by</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon gives me a sweet little kiss on my snoot before going his way to class, leaving me alone with Naomi and Spears</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears soon also goes his way, his face looking just as troubled as before</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It’s now only me and the ruddy ruler</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi’s brow furrows as she walks up to me</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “God dam it, Stella! What the hell did I tell you about keeping your nose clean!?” she practically shouts at me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I scoff and roll my eyes in response</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “What the fuck are you on about? I haven’t done SHIT!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I give Naomi my best grin</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Trish was the one who was fucking around with drugs. Makes sense considering how violent she was. Good riddance I say.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi narrows her eyes and glares at me</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I ain’t buying that it was Trish. She’s a ruffian, but she ain’t a crackhead…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She points an accusatory finger at me</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I think you planted those drugs in her locker to frame her”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I give Naomi a clap and a smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Congrats on figuring it out!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I lean in closer, all the while grinning as malicious as I can manage</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “What are you gonna do about it, huh? I made SURE to leave no trace of myself on those drugs. Far as any forensic team will be able to tell, only Trish touched the drugs.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi’s eyes go wide</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “You bitch,” she whispers as she gives me an annoyed look</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Why do you have to keep screwing with my plans?” she asks before letting out a sigh</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “You’re just lucky that removing Trish doesn’t affect my plan too much…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I laugh and pat Naomi on the back</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “See! With Trish gone, everyone wins!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi again narrows her eyes but ultimately shakes her head</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “This time, I mean it.

out of me in front of almost everyone in school</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I still can’t believe I got her to lose her cool as I did</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I was expecting her to blow up and do something stupid, yes, but never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined she would use my face as a punching bag</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Because of her assault, Fang was suspended for two weeks</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Apparently, her two weeks suspension also entailed going to counseling daily</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anger management classes, more than likely</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang's back in school after now though</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I prepared myself for a possible ‘round two’ of her beating</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But instead, I was met with a… very different Fang…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For starters, she wasn’t wearing her old punk goth outfit, having opted instead for what looked like a very casual yellow Sunday dress that… actually looks good on her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I’d say looks even better than her old outfit</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She’s also not wearing her old makeup anymore, instead letting her eyes shine naturally</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That tossed me for a loop, as I had expected fang to be using make-up to cover up for her mundanity</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Instead, she somehow looks more radiant without any makeup</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...Kinda pisses me off, if I’m being honest…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The one thing I do notice that most others might miss is that she looks miserable, yet also actively seems to be forcing herself to be content, her smile not all genuine in the least</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That morning, I’m with Anon, who just finished giving me the rundown on this amazing oldie show going by the name of Space Runaway Ideon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I so LOVE it when he gets all excited about a new show!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Makes my heart go all ‘doki, doki’!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Unfortunately, I put aside my feelings of bliss as I notice Fang walking up to me and Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She moves close</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Too close</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Instinctively, I raise my dukes to throw down</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But Fang instead hugs me, much to my surprise</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I shoot Anon a confused look</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He, in turn, shrugs and looks at me with as much confusion</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Thank you… thank you so, so much…” Fang says, all the while I feel a bit of moisture from my cheek</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “W-wait, what?” I end up asking, not sure what to make of the current situation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang pulls away and locks eyes with me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She then reveals that during her two weeks in psychiatric evaluation, she came to the realization that her main problem was that she didn't really know who she was, and as a result ended up clinging to stupid ideals such as non-binarism, as well as being a general rebel against a society she viewed was repressing her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She changed her tune pretty quickly after she got to speak to an actual psychologist, however</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The very short of a very long story is that she realized she had a lot of problems with anger and regret and that a big root of her problem stemmed from her self-loathing over what she did to Naser when they were young</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I don't bother asking her what she did to Naser, but she tells me anyway…</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I… I tricked Naser into thinking he could actually fly…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Wow… that’s kinda fucked,” Anon answers, taking the words right out of my mouth</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang nods in reply, her eyes still locked onto mine</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “...It gets worse though…” Fang whispered, all the while, her eyes shimmering and her bottom lip trembling</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I… I then goaded him into trying to jump off a nearby cliff…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon’s eyes go wide as saucer plates from the shock of hearing that</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I’d be lying if I said that hearing those words come out of Fang also didn’t shock me</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I could have stopped him at any time from jumping… but I just stood there and watched, all the while thinking to myself ‘Nah, my brother can’t be that much of an idiot to actually think he can fly!’...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The damn breaks and Fang brings her hands up to her face to keep her tears from staining her new clothes</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “He jumped right off that cliff and… and…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang begins to tremble and sob</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “He almost got himself killed that day… and it was all my fucking fault!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...Thanks for telling me all that, Fang…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I REALLY didn't need to know that</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now I can never look at Naser the same way ever again…</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I’m done hiding who I am and what I’ve done… and I’m done hiding my real name…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang takes a step away from Anon and myself, her eyes shimmering with tears</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “My name has been and will always be Lucy, and I love music, more than anything else…” Fang—or Lucy, rather—tells Anon and me with a wide bittersweet smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh, she makes me so badly want to punch her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not just for her expression, but as a bit of payback for the beating she gave me two weeks ago</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Some of those muscles are still sore</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's made having fun with Anon a lot more challenging than it should be…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Lucy hugs me again and thanks me</div><div class="fanfic-line">> ‘Why the hell are you thanking me for?’ I think but don't voice out loud</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Lucy starts crying and just keeps thanking me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I turn to look at Anon, who only gives me a shrug in response</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well... whatever</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At least Fang—or Lucy now, I guess, isn’t going to shoot up the school anymore and hurt Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One less thing to worry about!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It’s been… fuck, I don’t even know how it’s been</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Time kinda loses all meaning when you’re in jail</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I fucking hate this</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Why the FUCK am I in jail to begin with!?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I didn’t do shit this time!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Crack on my locker? I WASN’T distributing that shit!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>God fucking dammit…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Three years jail time for crack possession…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And they wouldn’t take my word that it those weren’t my drugs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Bunch of racist bigots!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fucking trigger haters…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fucking dammit… what the fuck did I ever do to deserve this shit…?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">FIVE MONTHS LATER</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Five months now since I first met Anon, my wonderful boyfriend</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He's such an amazing BF!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He so kind and understanding and considerate and most important of all, loyal… to a fault, even</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sure, he can be a bit of an idiot sometimes, but that's kind of one of the reasons I love him so much!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His escapades are just SO endearing!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Just the other day, he bought a little phone roomba off some weirdo down in little Troodon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I know little Troodon gets a bad rep due to all the shadiness and pickpockets and general cramp nature, but the place has some of the best noodle shops in Dinofornia, and the anime shops are second only to Jawpan</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In the last few weeks since Lucy's transformation from rebel without a cause to near school-shooter, she's gone on to become an actually decent person</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She hasn't quite abandoned all of her old habits though</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There's still this little part that used to be Fang still stubbornly holding on somewhere</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She’s also acting a lot more independent now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She's even started making friends outside of just Reed and Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Who knows, maybe she'll even find a boyfriend of her own now that she's not trying to shove non-binary beliefs that weren't ever her's in the first place down the throat of others</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In fact, Lucy and Reed had gotten a heck of a lot closer since her return from suspension</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wouldn't surprise me one bit if the two become an item now that Reed's not constantly sky high</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Everything's going well</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's almost like an endlessly wonderful season of anime had blessed me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As prom draws near, I start to ask just what dress I should wear</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon, of course, has already asked me to be his date days ago</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not like he was going to ask anyone else</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And if he did, they’d have to deal with me...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But it’s during this hectic time of planning that I receive a letter addressed to me:</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Meet me on the rooftop, alone, and we have to discuss the Trish situation you caused”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Fail to show up, and I'll contact the police and inform them of the truth”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Your move, Stella”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And it’s of course signed by none other than Naomi…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I crumple the letter and stuff it into my pocket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'll burn it later</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Right now, I have school to worry about…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Its after school now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I’m at standing on the rooftop, just like Naomi’s letter asked me to do</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As much as Anon wanted to come along, I told him that I’d meet him at his apartment later since I had some last-minute Gardening Club business to attend to</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sucks having to deceive him like that, but the last thing I want is for him to get mixed up in the crossfire between myself and Naomi</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It’s so weird</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I don’t think I’ve ever cared for anyone other than myself until Anon came along</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But something about him made that change</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Could be his personality</div><div class="fanfic-line">>How despite feigning apathy, he really cares about people deep down</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it can also be the fact that he’s the only guy in school that’s ever been able to stand me and my hobbies</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sad as it is to say, not everyone’s privy to the glory that’s anime</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it can also be that he doesn’t mind my love of the occult either, unlike a certain Latina friend of mine</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I swear... if Rosa wasn’t my roommate…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh Anon, how I wish you were here right now!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But I won’t risk your safety</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If anything were to happen to you, I’d probably kill every single person in Volcaldera Bluffs, and then myself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But damn… It’s quiet in the back of the school</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Too quiet…</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “So, you came after all,” Naomi’s voice snaps me from my thoughts</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Good. I guess you took my letter seriously...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Naomi,” I hiss, all the while fighting the urge to rush her down and beat the parasaurolophus up and leave her all purple and swollen</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She could be recording this, or there could be witnesses hidden from sight</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No need to act so rashly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At least not until I’ve heard what she has to say</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Then I can beat the shit out of her for pulling this stunt and breaking our little truce...</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Been a while since we spoke, hasn’t it?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Yes it has,” I hiss out, my brow furrowing with every word I say</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Never thought I would have to talk to you again,” Naomi adds with all the pleasure of having to deal with shit on her lunch</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “And it would have stayed that way had you not stuck your nose into my business,” I snap back, just barely able to keep my tone from carrying too much venom in it</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Oh, believe me, the last thing I wanted was to call you out on your ruffianism, but you took things too far and forced my hand”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I raise an eyebrow at the student president’s words</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi sighs and shakes her head</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “I looked the other way when you crippled that student”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “She was a major pain in the ass and deserves the humbling… Plus, there was never any evidence to accuse you, so why bother making the school look bad when it could all be written up as an accident?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “But the thing you pulled with Trish… that directly affected our school reputation…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi crosses her arms and scowls at me</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “What’s worse, it completely ruined my plans!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There goes this bitch with talks of her ‘plan’ again…</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I again perk an eyebrow</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “Your plans?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi narrows her eyes and grimaces so hard that she bears her teeth</div><div class="fanfic-line">> “You… fucking bitch! You literally ruined everything!
