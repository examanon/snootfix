Youjust couldn’t find underwear before you came to school, right?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She gives a giant glare at me while I look at her confused.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Suddenly it clicks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well less of a click and more of getting hit in the head with a brick.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It’s a bad analogy but it works for right now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”You have a...exhibitionist fetish?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She throws her hands forward to her sides, relieved that my retard brain finally worked it out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sorry Fang, I haven’t updated my brain’s processing power in five years.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Yes! Jeeze, you’re slow sometimes!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She huffs before taking another drag.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Look it...it just feels good, y’know?

Really sticking it to the man, y’know?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang’s mouth is agape, looking at me like I’m suddenly talking in a different language.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I feel like I’m possessed by a demon as I continue.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And hoo boy, it’s not letting go soon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Like there’s this stigma against letting yourself be free to just experience the winds of Earth and bustle of the city while stark naked, getting the thrill of nonchalantly walking around or barely escaping getting caught. That’s how you feel right?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She nods slowly, keeping the same face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I hold her hand as I finish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Look, Fang. I get it, and hell, I’d even go far as to say help you with it. I love you, and want you to be happy. And so what if you have an odd kink? If it makes you happy then it makes me happy.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I smile warmly after what I consider to be the worst thing I have ever said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It takes a few seconds before she responds quietly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”I...wow.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This is it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She’s gonna realize I’m too autistic for her own good and run.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang suddenly jumps at me, quickly hugging me while she’s got me pinned to the ground as I’m still shook from surprise.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Holy shit, someone understands!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She hugs a bit tighter before quickly letting go, blushing slightly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Uh, I mean, yeah. And uh, sorry.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I exhale before sitting back up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”It’s fine.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was, in fact, not fine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was right on top of me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A GIRL was on top of me.</div>
