Her soul is permanently stained, just as her scales are permanently stained by the tattoos.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang removes them by removing herself from Amber's life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Amber is all grown up now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She hasn't spoken to Fang in 15 years</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She finally comes home to Volcaldera Bluffs for the funeral of her father, who dies in a tragic blimp accident</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She is dreading seeing her mother again, for all the pain that Fang put her through</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reflects on the past, and realizes it wasn't Fang she was mad at</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Cue dramatic reunion, music swells, mother embraces daughter for the first time in years, cut to credits</div><div class="fanfic-line">>after-credits scene you see it's all a fever-dream by Fang as she lies there in the subway bathroom</div><div class="fanfic-line">>an empty syringe rolls away from her twitching body</div><div class="fanfic-line">>as blood starts to pour out from between her legs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Mommy's sorry, Amber..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wow that was dark even for me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hello pumpkin. Where's mommy?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Grampa? Are you visiting??""</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yes, I wanted to stop by; your daddy and I have to change our fishing plans this weekend... what's wrong?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It's nothing..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh come on, pumpkin, don't lie to your granddad. It'll break his heart."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Well... mommy is dirty. Then I tried to wash the dirt off, cuz if mommy is dirty I am too."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Dirty?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"All the kids at school saw it! They saw mommy has dirt on her scales. They think I have it too..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Dirt on her scales, huh? You must mean tattoos."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"What's a ta-ttoo, grampa?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"That's what they think the is 'dirt', pumpkin. But it's not dirt. It's just... something people get when they want to remember something. It's a little like ink on a paper, but it lasts forever."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Why would mommy get a ta-ttoo? What is she remembering?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Lots of things, I'm sure... she would know. But it's not dirty. Nothing wrong with having a tattoo. Even your old granddad has one."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Really?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley eases onto a single knee and rolls his sleeves further up, revealing tattoos on his shoulder</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I got this one back during the war, a long time ago. It reminds me of my friends... men I fought alongside, way back when."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley eases his pant leg up, revealing a calf tattoo</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"This one says my old unit name, like a code word. We all got this same tattoo, fighting for what we believe in."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Wow, that looks way older than mommy's tattoo!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I got it a long, long time ago, pumpkin. It... reminds me of the friends I made. People who weren't as lucky as me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley frowns but, seeing Amber, gently pats her head with a smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Ask your mommy about her tattoos. I bet they mean something special, too... and you don't have to get any, if you don't want to."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Thank you, grampa."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"No worries, pumpkin. Now let's go find your daddy."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang points to one on her left forearm</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's two semi-circles, separated by a small gap</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There's at the bottom there's two arrows pointing to small dot</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the top gap has nothing at all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"This one, is me and your father. The top is empty, because...We had a lot of problems in our lives, and nothing good to put there. The two arrows come out to show how we drifted apart, then they come back in as we found each other again. The small circle? That's you!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Amber traces the lines as Fang tells the story.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Mommy...There's two dots here."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang smiles.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"That's because you're going to have a brother or a sister soon."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Mommy...There's two dots here. But didn't you say you are st-er-ile?" Amber asks, stumbling with the tricky word.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Please stop listening to aunt Naomi, dear</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang balks for a moment, biting her lip at the small ptero's words</div><div class="fanfic-line">>How could she put this in a way little Amber could understand...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Well, sweetie, that's true. Mommy can't make you a brother or sister herself."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang takes Amber's hands in her own, squeezing them tight to keep her own tears at bay</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"But, luckily, Daddy and Mommy found someone else who can help with that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang manages to choke the words out without sobbing. Ever since her and Anon had discussed this, she wasn't sure she was ever going to be comfortable with it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But they both wanted it so bad.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You remember Auntie Trish, don't you Amber?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Remember Auntie Trish?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Is Daddy going to make a baby with her?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang couldn't control her sobs at this point, putting a hand over her mouth in a vain attempt. Especially as questions start to flood from little Amber's mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Is this why he's at Auntie Trish's place so often?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Is she's gonna be my new mommy?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Will she pick me up from school tomorrow? I wanna be with my cool mommy and not you!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley decides he's going to deal with this "Dirty Amber" situation once and for all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He will take her to school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wears a fest to show his shoulder tattoo</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Amber gets out the car.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hey! Dirty Amber! Is your dirty mom with you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley gets out the car</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"No, just her dirty grandpa."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Everyone shits their pants</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That put an end to that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Years later</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A young ptero woman walks into a tattoo parlour</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hi, I was wondering if I could get some work done."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She reaches into her pocket.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And pulls out a piece of paper</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Screen fades to black before you can see what's on it.</div>
