                <div class="fanfic-text">
                    <div class="fanfic-line">DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE MADE IT TO PART 3!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The kiss, same as the last one, starts slow and awkward. But whereas Stella pulled away last time, this time she doubles down. I can feel a dexterous tongue slither into my mouth, and any resistance I might have had melted right away. Every fiber, every atom of my body, knows how wrong this is. But I don’t care anymore. At that moment, Stella and I were one and the same.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Our hands find each other, and our fingers intertwine. I lay back on the bed, and Stella gets on top of me. The kiss breaks merely so we can get some oxygen. Her hot breath is driving me crazy in a way that I have never experienced in my life. I look into her eyes, and she looks back at me. We both know that we should stop. Hell, that we shouldn't have done any of this, to begin with. But our lives are forfeit already. Soon, the whole school will know of our forbidden relationship. Soon, we will both become social pariahs with no one but each other for company. Our future couldn’t look bleaker, yet as we stared into each other’s eyes, we came to the realization that as long as we had each other, the rest of the world could go fuck itself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not a second passes, and we've connected again, silently confirming that there are no breaks on this train. Not anymore. Our hands drift apart and start to explore all the fun new places. Stella’s scales are smooth to the touch and radiate heat, and once and for all confirming to me that dinos are warm-blooded. It doesn't take me long to figure out that she's not wearing a bra as my hand slowly travels up Stella’s chest, upon which I feel a lump of scaled flesh waiting and eager to be caressed. The sensation is difficult to describe. It feels so lovely and warm. Plump, but with the right amount of perkiness.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Meanwhile, Stella has settled into a kind of a missionary position. Or reverse missionary. As I continue kissing her and caressing her breast, she starts grinding up a storm against my jeans. My already hard dick only grows harder until my pants start feeling like they are prisons for my manhood. Yet, rather than causing her to slow, the feeling of my dick rubbing against her womanhood drives Stella further and further into lust. It isn't long until her entire nether regions become wet, which shows me that she also didn't have any panties.</div><div class="fanfic-line">With one final twist of her tongue, Stella breaks our kiss and fixes me with a look of barely restrained lust. “Anon... I want it... I want you!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, sweet merciful Raptor Jesus. That's fucking hot!</div><div class="fanfic-line">She again swoops down to kiss me, only this one feels deeper than the last. Her tongue once more overpowers mine as she assumes direct control over me in such a way that I cannot—and will not—dispute. The muscles that make up her tongue flick around inside of my mouth as I rub against its underside with my own, reflexively suckling on the invading limb. I’m absolutely shocked at how much longer her tongue's compared to mine as it not only dances whole musical numbers around mine, but does so in such a way that I don’t even feel like I’m getting a raw deal out of it. By this point, she has taken control, and I’m tagging along for the ride of my life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella suddenly breaks the kiss and glances down at her shirt. Without a word and with an understanding that I can only describe as instinctual, I grab the bottom of her shirt and pull it over her head. Meanwhile, she also holds the bottom of my shirt and janks it right over my head in one single move. We both toss our discarded shirts aside in unison. Before I get a chance to admire her now revealed abdomen, Stella is once more sucking on my face in an attempt to eat me. It would have been nice to have a look at her now exposed breasts, but feeling the tips of her tits pressing and rubbing against my naked chest is its own reward.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why should I be the only one enjoying myself?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Slowly, I drag my hand down Stella’s back, careful to navigate around her backplates. I run my hand over Stella’s shapely hips and ass as I slip my hand inside her pajama pants, little by little making my way towards her womanhood. The closer I get, the wetter and warmer it feels. It doesn’t take more than a few seconds before my hand reaches Stella’s second pair of lips, ones that feel far too eager to be pleased.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon… whaaa—!” Stella moans through our kiss, but she cuts herself off as I slip two fingers into her pussy. That causes her whole body to quake as she breaks off from our kiss to utter a plaint of pleasurable ecstasy. Taking advantage of the sudden momentum, I gently yet persistently stroke her pussy in a circle. Every turn I make sends more shivers through her body as she literally melts in my arms, her eyes glazing over in pleasure, her tongue hanging like a thirsty bitch in heat. Or, in this case, like a beautiful stego in estrus.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella takes a deep breath and fixes me with a savage lustful expression. Her very eyes seem to suddenly shine with something I can only describe as raw sexual energy as she pins me down on the bed. “Omae wa mo shinde iru!” she exclaims with what I swear are shining eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Na-nani!” I reflexively reply. Not a second passes after I finish my words that Stella grabs hold of my pants and janks them off, my boxes going along with them. In the instant that I blink, Stella has somehow managed to remove her own pants as well, leaving her fully exposed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The contrast between her previous nervous fidgeting and insecurities against the lustful and dominating sex animal before me is day and night. Yet despite that, It doesn’t feel like I’m dealing with an impostor or some kind of split personality. Instead, it feels like I see Stella—the REAL Stella—for the first time in my life. No more hiding behind garments or fake emotions. No more pretending to be something she isn’t. At that moment that I gaze upon her natural form, I can’t help but form a single sentence: “You're beautiful...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">For one second, Stella’s animalistic lust gives way to those beautiful light-blue eyes of hers. There's unmistakable moisture covering them. They fog up as her cheeks turn a pretty shade of pink. It isn’t long before her primal urges return again, but they don’t fully take over as she falls upon me and once more begins kissing me deeply. Her body, all of a sudden, feels warmer than before, the sensation of the tip of her scales ever so slightly biting into my skin an exciting, alien one. In return, my naked dick pokes at her soft thighs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before my brain can register it, I feel something grasping for my dick. I glance down to my thigh and see Stella’s hand wrapped around my soldier. Her breath shortens, and every muscle in her body tenses up. It doesn't last more than a second, though, and soon she's lining my dick up with her pussy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Now it's my body that stiffens, the tip touching the puffy, eager lips of her womanhood. For a fraction of a moment, the sane part of my mind wonders how Stella and I got to where we now are. What choices led two barely functional weebs to a night of unrestrained passion before the shitstorm of their own making?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Whatever the reason, it wasn't important anymore. The only thing matters now is accepting the feelings we have for one another and finishing this dance once and for all...</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wordlessly, I move my hands to Stella’s hip for encouragement. She gives me one last look of hesitation, almost as if her own brain is running through the very same thoughts I had finished putting aside. I only stretch up and plant a kiss on her lips as a sign of encouragement.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Instinctively I hold my breath. Stella does the same. Slowly, ever so slowly, she descends. Little by little, my dick enters her pussy. Stella raises her head up to the heavens as she lets out a slow and steady moan.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Meanwhile, I have no idea how to describe the sensation surrounding my little soldier other than ‘warm.’ Lines from various doujins and smuts flood my mind. Terms like ‘velvety insides’ and ‘so hot I'm melting.’ I feel kinda let down; it feels wet and warm, but it's not like I've expected those to be documentaries. Although as she pushes my dick deeper and deeper, it really starts—</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah, it—</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, it—</div><div class="fanfic-line">WOW!</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ohfuckmethisfeelsamazing!” I shout at the top of my lungs as my grip tightens around Stella’s hips, which prompts her to stop with a surprised yelp.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“A-are you okay? I-is this okay?!” she asks, her face so flushed that I'm legit afraid for her brain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Y-yeah. Is it okay for you?” I ask despite my brain telling me to start trusting with reckless abandon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella bites the bottom of her lip and nods but doesn't go any lower than she already was. I pull her into another kiss, and we settle into a lustful yet awkward rhythm. Our movement even out as we get into it, and I risk going in a little deeper into her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella suddenly stops and winces in pain “A-ah... F-fuck…” she whimpers as her body once more quakes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try backing away, panicked, but she keeps me pinned down. Then I feel it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">At first, I feel that something weird is going on down there. Like it just got warmer and wetter. I glance down to see what is happening, and then I see it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Blood.</div><div class="fanfic-line">My brain freezes. I didn't even consider that Stella could be a virgin like me. Not after that pro of a blowjob she gave me on the roof.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I want to apologize to Stella, but somehow I feel like that'd make things worse. When I again stare into her eyes, I see the tears as she desperately tries to gulp the pain down. Yet, her tears aren’t like those from earlier, which were full of sadness and self-loathing. I know for a fact when she gives me the warmest, most love-filled simper I had seen from the stego in my life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">We stay connected for a bit before she collapses onto me. There's a pitiful attempt on her part to bounce up and down, but she can't keep that up for more than a few seconds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Um... Could we... Switch places?” Stella meekly asks, almost as if expecting me to shout at her in anger.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“W-we can stop if—”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No!” she snaps almost in reflex. “I… I don't want to stop...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella gives me a peck on the lips, then gets up. Her stiff, jerky movements show that she's still obviously in pain. She lays down facing upwards, and I get on top of her. We start going at it missionary style, but her face contorts painfully with every one of my thrusts. She tries kissing me again to distract me, but by that point, it’s evident to me that something’s wrong. After about a minute, she gently pushes me away and excuses herself to the bathroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I sit on the bed quietly. Whatever lust-induced bravado I had leaves me as I suddenly start feeling like shit. I try not to overthink the situation as I wait for Stella to return to me. Instead, I quickly jack off and finish before wiping myself off from the various body fluids and search for my pants among the piles of other discarded clothes. When I find them, I fish out my boxers and quickly put those back on before returning to the bed.</div>
