class="fanfic-line">>Ah yes, the Volcano High cafeteria.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>if you'd told old loner me that I'd enjoy sitting here with other people, friends even, and spending our lunch together, I'd have called you crazy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>not to your face, perhaps.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but I would've made a sarcastic post about it later.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>guess I've really grown as a person.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and thinking of friends and growing...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>my searching eyes wander along the line of students still waiting for their food.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>there they are.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish has her back to me, as she is currently talking to the lunchlady filling her tray, but it's not like she's the main attraction here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>that would be the raptor behind her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>oh yes, Reed certainly has done the most growing out of any of us recently.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and in all the right, or rather, wrong places, too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>perhaps I should have said something when he made the switch from carfentanyl to this sythetic hormone stuff, but what did I know?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the guy has been doing terrifying amounts drugs that would have killed lesser beings for as long as I have known him and never suffered any ill effects</div><div class="fanfic-line">>his electrical engineering at Moe's had looked like a fire hazard and had worked just fine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>evidently Reed knew what he was doing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so I had assumed that things would be the same this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>seems like I was wrong.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>to say that there were side effects would be selling things short.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>he'd started taking this stuff on a friday, and when I saw him the monday after I already could tell that there was something going on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>his scales had been even brighter than usual and shone as if they had been freshly groomed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the feathers on his head had seemed longer as well, and I could have sworn that his hips had flared out a little wider than usual.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but I'll admit, it had been kind of easy to dismiss the concerns raised by this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed had simply taken a much more thorough shower than usual this morning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>perhaps he'd started track and was building some more muscle in his thighs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>he definitely needed a haircut though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but over the next few weeks, those simple dismissals had become impossible.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>now let me make something clear:</div><div class="fanfic-line">>as an avid user of certain finngolian wine tasting websites, you are going to sooner or later see a whole bunch of traps.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and or trans</div><div class="fanfic-line">>don't even have to see that sort of stuff out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>you know the deal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>anyways, what I am getting at here is that</div><div class="fanfic-line">>if I hadn't known him before, I never would have believed that Reed was a male.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>not with that wild feathery mane, barely kept in check by a haphazardly slung bandana.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the lithe, sporty body with nonetheless pronounced hips.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the torn old tank top that's barely held together by two knots and always seems close to slipping and revealing just a bit too much of Reed's perky new-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>hrrr-hmmm</div><div class="fanfic-line">>where were we?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh yeah.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That easygoing smile underneath eyes that seem stuck in a half-lidded trance more offen than not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed must have some great facial genetics.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>his eyelash game should have been illegal even before this whole mess started, after all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"What are you looking at?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>a quick jab into my ribs makes me tear my eyes off of the pink raptor in the line of hungry highschoolers and turn them towards Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang who is sitting right next to me and giving me glare that stops just short of activating my fight or fight response.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang, my beautiful and beloved girlfriend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Dear Raptor Jesus, if I've mumbled my thoughts out again, I'm so fucking dead.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Are you even listening to me," Fang asks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>While I do my best to appear nonchalant, I inwardly breathe a breath of relief.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No unwanted golf lessons for me this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You were talking about Mr. Jingo," I guess, trying my best to sound confident.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So you really weren't listening. No, Anon, I wasn't talking about Mr Jingo. What were you staring at, anyways?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh dear God, the glare intensifies.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Jeez, Fang, I was just looking for the others. Can't you get off my case?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Suddenly the anger in her face is gone, replaced with something that looks a whole lot more like sadness</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Alright."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>with that, she grabs her tray, stands up and makes for the exit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I jump to my feet as well, but Fang has already disappeared through the cafeteria door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hey Anon," I hear Reed's voice behind me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Should we give you some space?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I just don't get it," I tell Reed as we make our way through the overgrown hallways of Volcano High, Trish having split from us a bit earlier to go to the Bathroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>probably for the best, the way she's been staring daggers at me all throughout the lunchbreak.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"She's been just so moody lately. One minute she's having a great day, the next it's as if I've rained on her parade somehow. I keep racking my head, but I just can't figure out what I've done wrong."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"And have you tried asking her what's wrong, dude?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Of course I did! On a daily basis. But she keeps brushing off the question. I am at my wit's end here."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>well, not quite.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>seems like there is at least one neuron that is still fighting the good fight, because I have an idea.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Reed? Don't take this the wrong way, but you are basically a girl now, right? Do you- Do you think Fang could be on the rag? Do you think tha- Ow!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed's jab hurts even more than Fang's did.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Damn, dude."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed shakes he- his head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Please stop embarrassing yourself, bro. Hell, you're embarrassing ME, and I am the one who plays the school mascot on the reg."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I am still half doubled over, my left hand clutching my certainly bruised ribs, but I manage to raise the right one in an apologetic gesture.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Alright," I wheeze, "I am sorry for calling you a girl, man. Won't happen again."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed looks at me as if he is questioning my sanity, dragging his hands through his mane.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Don't make me hit you again, bro," he mutters, more to himself than for my benefit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>a long suffering sigh follows.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Anon, this isn't about what you called me, alright. I couldn't care less, dude. This is about you being denser than a fucking neutron star."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I am pulling myself back up in a somewhat more upright postion, using the locker beides me to lean on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I am not sure I follow."</div><div class="fanfic-line">> a loud bang makes me twitch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed has slammed his arms against the locker to my left and right, blocking my escape routes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Let me help you jog your memory, bro," he says, leaning in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>though this up close, the "he" feels even less appropiate than before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>for God's sake, Reed's breasts are almost pressed against my chest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it could be a moment straight out of my japanese doujins if there weren't a few little problems.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>for one, I have a girlfriend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>one I intend to stay fatithful to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and secondly, being cornered by a pissed off raptor like this would probably ruin anybody's mood.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>well, perhaps not anybody's.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>there's a lot of weird fucks out there.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but I sure as hell do not belong to them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>you want proof?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>try my genitals, which are currently trying to escape back inside my body.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>silly dick, that little muscle and fat tissue won't protect you from a raptor's claw.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>tok, tok, tok.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hello, earth to anon? You there, bro?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Y-Yeah, I am awake. Fine and dandy."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I rub my forehead, where Reed's tapping knuckles found a way to get me back to the present.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Then perhaps start listening," Reed says, even her (her? Fuck it, her) usual calm and relaxed manner giving way to exasperation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"When would you say Fang's mood swings started?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That's a good question.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it feels like our relationship has been soured by them for a long time, even if it logically couldn't have been more than a few weeks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>in fact, the first incident that comes to mind must've been just about a month ago.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang had wanted to take me to a new music store downtown to check out their selection.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but then I offhandedly mentioned wanting to hit up a sports shop on the way back to look for some new sneakers for gym class.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed had told me that there were some affordable ones on sale, and I really could've used some new ones to replace the ragged, musky scraps that I had worn for the better part of the last 4 years.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>as soon as I'd said my piece, Fang began making up transparent excuses not to go.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'd even offered to do the shoe shopping another time, but the damage had been done.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang had asked me to leave and probably spent the rest of the day sulking in her room with a bag of dino tendies, while I had done my best to stealthily exfiltrate her parents' house, praying that her father wouldn't connect his daughter's bad mood to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed nods.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"And what else happened right around that time?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>hmyea, what did?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>can't say I remember a whole lot of things that stand out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>in fact, the last month had been the most "normal" month I've had since I transferred to Volcano High.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>except for the fact that Reed had started the hormone shit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but that must've been about two weeks before Fang's issues started.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the effects the compound had l</div><div class="fanfic-line">on Reed's body had already been impossible to deny by the time we had planned our trip downtown.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>something clicks inside my head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I had mentioned that Reed had tipped me off on the sale and Fang hadn't wanted to go anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and now that I think about it:</div><div class="fanfic-line">>that time we had wanted to go the cinema.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang had talked about bringing Trish along.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I jokingly offered to invite Reed, and the plan had been dead in the water.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>that other time she seethed at me after I told her we could spend an afternoon doing nothing, because I'd copy the homework from Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed, Reed, Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>connecting every single one of her little episodes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but why?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>looking back, it's almost as if she didn't like me spending time with Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but weren't they friends as well?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>bandmates, even.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>while Reed and I were simply bros.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but honestly, looking at Reed now, I have to admit it:</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed simply doesn't quite qualify for the label of bro anymore</div><div class="fanfic-line">>with a groan of frustration I bang the back of my head against the locker</div><div class="fanfic-line">>of course she's jealous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>time to fix this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fuckin' finally!" Reed cheers, pushing herself away from the lockers and opening the way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>did I mumble to myself again, or did she read my mind?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>if anyone has opened their third eye, it must be Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>on the other hand, you could probably tell where my thoughts had gone from facial expressions alone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>not that it matters how Reed knows my conclusions</div><div class="fanfic-line">>all that matters right now is that she lets me go and try to save my relationship.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed is hot on my heels as I rush through the corridors of Volcano high, dodging and weaving past the other students milling about.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang should be on her way to her English class, so if I manage to catch her on her way there, I should be able to explain the situation to her and make my apology just in time to leave us with a harmonious afternoon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>just one more corner and-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and nothing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the hallway in front of the classroom is almost empty, the few students lounging about are a far cry from the loud masses that usually form before a lesson begins.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>a piece of paper bearing the school's letterhead is haphazardly taped to the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I rip it off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed picks this moment to catch up with me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Jeez Anon, you could've waited for me, bro."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the tip of her snout appears in my peripheral vision as she peers over my shoulder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"What's that? Oh man, class is cancelled? Dude, I tell you, some people have all the luck."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I don't even react to her comment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>my brain is too busy making use of this new information to figure out a plan of action.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>where would a morose Fang go?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the first thing that comes to mind is the roof.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but that's not an option.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spear has made it a point to keep the roof access chained shut until the suicide fence has been repaired.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>something about keeping students from doing things everyone involved would regret or something to that effect.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so what does that leave me with?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>dino-moe's seems like a likely alternative, but gets dismissed on a second thought.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>from the way the old rex had acted when I first met him he definitely didn't seem like Fang's first choice for comfort.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>his little Lucy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>heh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>God, I really do love her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and if that means that I'll have to risk losing my life at the only place I'll likely find her, so be it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'll brave the golf club once more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So, Reed," I ask, "you here by car today?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>for a moment she seems bewildered by the question.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah, like always. I need the trunk, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>as if I could forget the bottomless stash of illicit substances that is Reed's trunk.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Right. Can you do me a favor and drop me off at Fang's? Like, right now?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>her eyes light up and a thin smile creeps its way up her snout.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So we're ditching?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fuck yeah we are."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed snickers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fang's right, dude," she says, "you really are a dweeb."</div><div class="fanfic-line">â€‹</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hey Anon, getting it on with the new girl already?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I ignore the shouted comment and jump in the passenger seat of Reed's beat up old junkmobile.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>aw yeah, riding shotgun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but I'd be lying if I said that the jeer hadn't reminded me of some questions I'd meant to ask.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>should've asked a lot earlier, probably.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So, Reed," I start as we pull out of the parking area, doing my best to sound nonchalant, "how're you doing? Everything alright on your end?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she gives me a sidelong glance, but doesn't quite take her eyes off the road in front of us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I am fine. Happy as a clam."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>well, that would've sounded a whole lot more believeable if there were some more of that Reed-energy in it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>not this hollow neutrality.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but should I push her on it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I am so not ready for this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>cursing myself for having been such a damn social recluse that spent the better part of the time others learn to handle social situations watching japanese cartoons and shitposting, I make another attempt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"That's good. Real good. I am just asking because, you know..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>My hands flail in a way that tries to indicate the whole of her body</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"...all of this seems like something that might take some getting used to-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed is still doing her best to focus completely on the road, seemingly determined to shut me out, but she doesn't manage to hide the snort that escapes her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Is this a good sign?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>fuck it, just keep talking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"-for all of us. So I just want you to know that I am here for you. So if you-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I appreciate it, Anon."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed has finally turned to face me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>there's a sad little smile on her face and her eyes seem a little wet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I am going to be honest with you, bro. When I started taking the stuff, I didn't think that it would lead to something like this."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she imitates my earlier gesticulating before quickly returning her hands to the wheel.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>now it's my turn to snort.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"but now that it's happened? I don't hate it, man. Not at all. And that's what worries me. I mean, this is the kind of stuff that should make people freak out, right? So why is all I can think 'he, that's kinda neat'? Have I fried my brain that badly over the years?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she pounds the steering wheel.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the tears are flowing freely now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>trying to reassure her without interrupting, I put my hand on hers when she goes for the clutch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>for half a second she pulls back, only to grab my hand hard and hold on to it as if her life depended on it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"And no one seems to miss me, you know? No one at school's asking what happened to good old Reed. Sure, you guys know, our class knows, but besides them? All those little shits that treated me like I was their best bro as long as I hooked them up seem to think that I am just a new student and that their dealer buddy moved. It shouldn't fuck me up like this, dude, but it does. Even Trish, Fang... you, you all just kind of ignored things. Kept on keeping on as if nothing happened. And I get that. 'Reed must be going through something pretty intense right now, best not to make things worse', but what I really needed was someone to affirm my existence. Not just my current one, but that I was there before, you know? Something that says REED WAS HERE in big bold letters. Just- just a sign that people won't forget me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she presses my hand hard, then withdraws, returns it to the steering wheel</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I feel a warm trickle run down to my wrist: Reed's claws have drawn blood.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Anyways, thank's dude. It was good getting this all out."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>there's that sad smile again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Guess it's my own fault for net being more proactive with that shit. Always hated drawing attention to myself."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now that's something I can't quite believe.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Come on, Reed. You are a drummer in a band. You play in front of people. If anyone can handle attention, it's you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Name one band where the drummer isn't in the back, dude."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>when I fail to immediately answer, her shoulders sag, as if disappointed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Besides, we never had big venues."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"But what about your parents? Surely they must've noticed something-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Those fucking deadbeats?" she cuts me off. "They never noticed me getting high. Not even dealing. If they thought anything was different, they'd tell themselves it's just a phase. Raptor Jesus knows they'd never confront me about it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the car decelerates as it pulls into a parking spot and only now do I notice that we have arrived in front of Fang's house.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Alright, dude. Final destination. Get out and good luck."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You aren't sticking around?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Anon, I think the last thing Fang wants to see right now is the two of us together."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>My face must given away how I feel about leaving Reed on her own after she has just unloaded all her emotional baggage on me, because the sad smile returns yet again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hey, come on bro. I'll be alright. Go and make things right with your girlfriend."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You sure that you don't want to stay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah, dude. Who knows, perhaps I shoot up a bunch of test, come back to school tomorrow as my old self. Wouldn't that be something?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>her smile gains a desperate quality as her attempt at a joke falls flat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Do what feels right to you," I tell her. "Whatever it is, I'll have your back. The others will, too."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I finally get out of the car and offer her a parting fist bump through the open window.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I'll call you later, alright?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she lightly taps her knuckles against mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah. And thanks again for listening to my bullshit, Anon."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>before I have a chance to add something, she steps on the gas.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I watch the little car go until it disappears around a corner.</div>
