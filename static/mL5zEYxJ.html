                    <div class="fanfic-line">Heatwave</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Chapter 1</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Late July and it feels like a deity with a craving for mortal nuggies has put Volcaldera Bluffs into a cosmic oven. The one thing my shitty apartment had going for it was the lack of direct sunlight in the summer. While others are being cooked alive I am just chilling, or more accurately, just simmering. Fang asked to stay for a few days, my terrible neighborhood being a trivial issue if it meant she could find respite from the heat. I hastily agreed, since only a madman would say no if their hot girlfriend asked to stay a couple of days at their place. Fang never elaborated on what she told her parents. Hopefully, Ripley won't kill me if, or rather when, he finds out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's early morning and it’s already becoming difficult to separate my back from the couch. If the heat doesn’t relent soon I will start fusing with the cheap faux leather. Fang has just exited the bathroom, finished with her most recent shower.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Raptor Jesus, when will this shit end?” Fangs' voice was strained, “I’m in there so often I’ll wear a groove between your shower and bed.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh come on Fang, it's not that bad”, I roll my head to look in her general direction, “Besides, doesn’t your kind like the heat?” It’s not the best idea to be a smart-ass if a girl has sharp claws, but spending so many years shitposting on a Serbian moonshine tasting forums gives you some bad habits.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Maybe if you read that book I got you, you’d know ‘my kind’ is warm-blooded”, Fang said in a huff. It’s true, I haven’t read the entire book. Mainly because certain chapters demanded all of my attention. You could call me an expert on certain parts of ptero girl anatomy, hopefully soon I will be able to become an expert in both the theoretical and practical sense. Fang gets a mischievous grin “But if you’re not bothered by this damn heat you won’t mind this.” In a blink of an eye, Fang leaps onto the couch, her light body barely causing a stir. Fang puts her arms around my waist and gingerly rests her head onto her favorite spot on my chest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If anyone asked I would claim this was all according to plan. With only a few words I convinced my ptero girlfriend to want to cuddle with me during this oppressive heat. This was all according to plan and not dumb luck. I slowly put my right hand around her back and start caressing her side. Fang let out a light sigh, a short burst of wagging from her cute tail indicating she was enjoying the moment. Thanks to her most recent shower Fang was still pleasantly cool to the touch. The heat and I would make sure of that wouldn’t be the case for much longer. It wouldn’t be long before the heat cut this cuddling session short. I decided to make my peace with dying from heatstroke. There was no way in hell I’m telling Fang to let go. Not that I thought she’d be upset, but rather that I didn’t want the moment to ever end. My only regret was not setting up anything to automatically purge my internet history. Should have listened to Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My musings are cut short when Fangs lets out a surprised sound. “Oh, what are you looking for down there Anon?” My hand took advantage of my distracted mind and went on a little trip of its own. It almost made its way to Fangs' exposed rear. I do a quick double-take. There were usually jeans covering all of what laid bare before me. The only article of clothing I could see was a thin black line making a small indent in Fangs' waist. I glance down to get a full look and saw Fang was wearing nothing more than her black halter top and underwear. She was practically naked. Fang adjusts her head to look up at me, her voice dripping with sarcasm “And here I thought humans were supposed to be brave and competent explorers.” Thanks, hand, can’t leave you alone for a minute without getting into trouble. “Then again, even the greatest explorers made use of local guides”, Fangs' voice switching from sarcastic to sweet in an instant. She put her hand over mine and slowly guided it down further south. As my hand was being gently pulled over the thin strip of cloth, Fang continued “Just over the river and we’ll soon reach our destination.” The whole ordeal was like the time Fang taught me how to play the guitar in her room, except she was the instrument. As she put my hand on her firm butt cheek, she gave it a light tap and continued “There you go, safe and sound”. My mind was racing, should I squeeze it, should I just wait for further instructions? The book did not prepare me for this situation. “While you ponder what to do down there, I believe it’s time to pay your guide her dues.” Before I could ask what she meant by that, Fang put her left arm on the backside of my head and dragged it down into a kiss.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After a short while, Fang breaks the kiss and settles her head back onto my chest. While my gray matter was doing an admirable job at stopping a flood of spaghetti from bursting out of my pockets, it neglected one crucial thing. My mouth. “Fang, where are your pants?” I blurt out like a lagging idiot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang lazily replied, “Too hot for pants”. Damn right you are. At that, I could feel Fangs' embrace slightly tighten and she let out a small giggle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Nice save Romeo,” Fangs' tail making a few loud thumps against the couch. For once my mumbling was beneficial. I was being completely truthful as well. Her physique was pretty much perfect and probably earned Fang many envious glances over the years. It wasn’t just visually appealing either, while a thin girl, Fang still had enough muscle and strategic deposits of fat to make touching feel as good as looking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My deep contemplation about Fang's tight bod was once again cut short when she spoke up. “So, how long are you going to act tough before you admit the heat is unbearable?”, her amber orbs looking up at me, knowing full well she was at the moment too hot to handle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I had forgotten the words that got me into this blissful situation so I simply replied: “I've made my choice, if this is how I go then so be it.” Fang let out a laugh and broke her embrace. She leaned back on both hands giving me a full view of her barely covered body.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon you dweeb, you barely managed to get to second base and you're already content with ending it all? Have some ambition.”, her playful voice making it clear she was just teasing. When Fang caught me staring she slowly swayed her hips from side to side and asked “See anything you like Anon?”, her mirthful voice betraying that she enjoyed using me as a puppet with her sultry moves. Since my mouth could not be trusted it was decided with a unanimous vote by all higher mental functions to say nothing and just nod in approval. “Aw, that’s it? You have nothing to say about my little show? I kind of like it when you blurt out stupid shit.” Fang is now leaning only on one hand and slowly tracing a clawed finger starting at her lower midriff and going ever higher. I can’t help but stare like an idiot once again. As she reaches her neck she makes a short pause. “I have to say, making you squirm like this is a real turn on”, with that said she does her best at seductively biting her finger. The logical part of my brain would claim that while the show so far was great, the whole finger biting part was fumbled. The problem is my brain was currently operating off of blood IOUs from my lower member. Running on backup power meant my mouth was once again prevented from creating a sound that would give HP Lovecraft nightmares. Upon hearing the unholy noise Fang lost all composure and starts laughing like I just told her the best joke ever written. “Oh Raptor Jesus my sides! You should have seen the faces you were making Anon, and that noise, priceless.” Fangs' laughter slowly subsides, wiping a tear from her eyes as she finally calms down. She quickly sees my utterly baffled expression and jumps from her lounging pose to a sitting one. “I hope you don’t mind if I yank your chain from time to time Anon”, her voice slightly apologetic. “After all, you’re my…” Fang slowly puts her arms around my neck. “...little…”, she leans closer to my ears. “...pet”, Fang ends her sentence with a barely audible whisper and voice hot enough to melt steel. Deciding to not waste any time waiting for me to respond, she drags me into another kiss. This one is far longer and more passionate than the last. If Volcaldera Bluffs wasn’t in the middle of a heatwave already we’d start one right now with how hot the room was getting. After a solid minute, Fang slowly ends the kiss, face completely flushed just like mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang gets a sheepish expression on her face. “Maybe we should wait for a colder day though. I don't want to be charged with manslaughter if your heart gives out”, her voice sounding apologetic. Even if things didn’t go farther, getting a show from seductress Fang was always a treat. I nod in agreement and Fang visibly relaxes. I didn’t have much confidence I’d have survived the ordeal in this heat anyway. It wasn't even noon and the apartment was already becoming unbearable. No direct sunlight is meaningless if the entire area is being cooked for a few weeks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why don't we go to the beach to cool off?” I inquired while trying to wipe the sweat off of my face with my already drenched shirt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“The beach is already crowded at this point, we'd be like sardines. Those fucking tourists probably took all the good anyway”, Fang was not a fan of those weird tourists who, for some reason, used their country's flag as towel patterns.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Is there nowhere else? You've lived your whole life here Fang, you have to know about a place where we can cool off.” The constant heat made me desperate and I didn't even</div><div class="fanfic-line">try to hide it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I know of a small creek not that far away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">But there’s no way in hell can we make it on foot before being burnt to a crisp.” Fang slumped halfway off the couch in resignation</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang, you know we don’t have to walk”, there were other means of getting to the creek. A short pause was followed by a resounding no, it didn’t take Fang too long to figure out what I was implying. “Please Fang!” my voice was getting desperate, but I stopped caring when my back got stuck to the couch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why can't you do it?”, Fang now completely slid off of the couch with only her lower legs on the armrest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Because he'll only do it if you're the one asking”, probably not, but if Fang did it the chances of success were much higher.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fiiiine”, her voice being that of a stereotypical annoyed teenager, ”I'll call Naser and ask if he wants to go to the creek.” I am a genius. “But you owe me big for this Anon.” Oh no. “First things first, get me my phone because I'm not getting up”, I peel myself off of the couch and barely make it to the table where Fangs' phone is. I consider throwing it, but decide to just crawl as close as I could to my fallen angel and hope she’ll be able to reach it. Fang snatches the phone from my hand, giving me a look of pity and understanding before giving the little rectangle her full attention. She begins furiously typing for a few seconds before stopping and letting out another loud groan. “God, texting this shit is going to take forever, I'm going to have to call him”, Fangs' voice being that of resignation, “Consider your debt doubled Anon.” I was expecting worse. My girlfriend is merciful and wise like always.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang dialed her brother and waited. I collapse into a puddle of sweat and watch her slowly kick her feet as the dial tone kept repeating. After a while it was looking like Naser wasn’t going to pick up and I'd still be indebted to Fang for nothing. “Looks like he's no-” Fang stopped talking because at the last moment Naser answered the phone. Even now there is hope. “Sup you little shit”, Fangs 'greeting' sounded harsh, but she assured me siblings are like that. “Just being slow-cooked at Anons place”, I couldn’t make out what Naser was saying and Fangs' expression was neutral, so I just hoped he knew where she was from the start. “Yeah, whatever, listen... It’s hell on earth here. You want to go to the creek with me and anon?”, I shouldn't have expected Naser to chauffeur us around. Can't say I wasn't disappointed it wouldn't be just the two of us either. “Come on, does she have to?”, Fangs' legs stopped kicking at whatever Naser said. “Alright, fine, bring her with.” Fangs knew it was no use fighting whatever stipulations Naser made if she wanted a ride in the NasCar. “Yeah, you know where I keep it. Also, bring the thing, we’ll get the food and drinks”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang ended the call and got up. “Alright dweeb, I did it. Naser is taking us to the creek”, Fangs' wings sag and she lets out a loud groan, ”Naomi is coming with him.” Oh god, I hope Fang doesn't quadruple my debt. “Some of the others are also planning to come. Apparently the cotton candy cunt was planning some shit, but now wants to do it at the creek”, Fang started searching the apartment for her missing pants. It was a bit early for a reunion but it would be a lie to say I wasn’t a little excited. As she slid on her torn jeans in one fluid motion she looked at me still lying on the ground like and commanded “Come on Anon, get your stuff, and let's go. We still have to go to the DinoMart on the corner.” Knowing it was a bad idea to make Fang repeat myself I quickly change from my drenched shirt to a dry one and get all the shit that one has in his pockets.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So what junk food are we getting“, I ask Fang who looked at me like I said something monumentally stupid.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Right, you couldn’t hear Naser. We’re going to have a barbecue Anon, so no junk food”, Fang is practically pushing me out of the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I didn’t know Naser knew how to work a grill”, to which Fang starts laughing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Naser can barely work the microwave, I’m going to be the one behind the grill.”</div>
