You're just going to study for midterms. With Trish. At Trish's house. With Trish. Alone. With Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wow, that did not help. At least this alarm sounds new, I don't think I've heard this particular flavor of klaxon before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You say something?" Oh right, Trish is here too. And I'm going to Trish's house. With Trish. Alone. With Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yup, yup, all good here, all cool," I reply. How many times am I going to have to tell that lie today?</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright, anyways, so I…" The alarms drown out Trish almost immediately. Hope whatever she's saying isn't important.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And we're here!" Raptor Jesus, what? That was fast. I think.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a moment to drink in where I would be spending the next few hours, or the rest of my life in some scenarios. Trish's house was actually quite modest, boasting only a single story, a small garage suitable for a single car, and a fairly small stripe of lawn that stretched to the sidewalk.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish fiddles with a keychain that clearly has too many keys, tags and other random stuff on it, then finally slots a key into the door and turns it. She opens the door and ushers me in, closing it behind me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The living room was surprisingly barren. There was a moderately sized flat screen TV on a console, a coffee table littered with random papers and office supplies, a dull but comfortable looking couch and not much else to speak of, leaving plenty of space to walk around in. Wonder if it looked any different during Triceratops History Month.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So, uh, where-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Not out here, follow me." Trish swiftly rounds a corner down a hallway, and I follow. Where else could we study?</div><div class="fanfic-line">She pops open a door and waves me inside, and the alarms return in full force.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm in Trish's room. With Trish. Alone. With Trish. How on earth did this even happen? I mean, Trish had warmed up to me a little bit over the last few months, despite all the speciesist slurs and threats of violence she still hurls at me, but that surely shouldn't have brought me this far, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuck am I even thinking? We're here to study, not get laid. Raptor Jesus above, Anon, get a goddamned grip.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take stock of the room, and it's in complete contrast to the rest of the house. The walls are covered almost top to bottom with posters of famous musicians, artists and celebrities. The bulk of the floorspace was taken up by a bed and set of dressers, both of which seemed far larger than necessary for someone Trish's size. A pair of basses and a small pile of audio equipment sat in a corner, wires snaking around towards some unseen power source.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish flings her backpack onto the bed and then dives onto it face first, letting out a drawn out groan.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You brought the fuckin'...books, right skinnie?" I unzip my backpack and start rifling through it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah I brought the fuckin' books. Math, science, language, music. Where are we gonna start?" Her only response is another groan.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Music?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I have that covered, if you didn't realize."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Math?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Reed actually helps me instead of just doing all the work for me, you know."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Language?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mister Gobbledegook and his midterm can go fuck themselves."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay, science it is." She lets out another frustrated groan like a teenage girl would.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Shoulda picked something else. It's science time." I yank the bulky textbook out and toss it onto the bed next to her. Wait, this is not a good idea.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh, where am I…"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Get up here, idiot." Raptor Jesus save me. I clamber onto the bed and seat myself next to her. Trish sits up as I flip open the textbook to one of the chapters we covered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I guess we'll start here. How do you want to do this?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I dunno, just...read it to me or some shit," she says noncommittally, lying back down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Work with me you...you…</div><div class="fanfic-line">My thought is interrupted by what I can only assume is the garage door rattling and squeaking open, followed by a car engine getting closer and cutting off, then the garage door rattling and squeaking closed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ah, look who's home," Trish says, not a single trace of emotion present. Must be mom, considering that's the only family member of her's that I've heard about, and only during rants.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look over to a relevant paragraph in the textbook and start reading aloud from it. I throw in one of the text's basic questions that do little more than reassure you that you know how to read, and Trish actually answers it correctly. Maybe she is paying attention after all. I continue for a bit until she leans back up and interrupts me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey Anon?" Her voice was unlike anything I had heard from her before, like she was about to say something genuine and not insult me or anything like that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah?" I hopefully didn't sound too worried about what she was going to say. She reaches over and touches me on the arm and oh fuck fuck fuck-</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Can you do me a favor?" Why did it sound like she was pleading with me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah?" I try to contain my panic and probably fail.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Could you get some water from the fridge?" You've gotta be fucking kidding- no, Anon. You're just an asocial idiot, panicking about extremely basic questions because they're from a girl. A pretty girl- anyways.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yup, water, can do. I'll be right back."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wait, Anon." Oh, I'm fucked now aren't I?</div><div class="fanfic-line">"If my mom says anything to you, just ignore her. She probably won't have anything nice to say."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, yeah, no problem." I leave the room and close the door behind me, taking a second to catch my breath. What the fuck is wrong with me? I nearly drowned Vulcadera Bluff in spaghetti because a girl touched my arm. Surely I'm not that pathetic, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">I eventually wander over to the kitchen and into the fridge, grabbing a couple of store brand bottles of water. I step back into the living room and a purple head with long, sharp horns and a glass of cheap wine in hand looks over at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh what the hell, why is my daughter bringing home goddamn skinnies? Now you listen to me, boy…" I did what I was told and tuned her out, power walking back to Trish's room with bottles in hand. I enter the room and close the door behind me, silencing the buzzed triggout behind me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Told ya," Trish says, her voice strangely sympathetic. I murmur an agreement of sorts, handing her a bottle and cracking mine open. All that talking made me thirsty.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">One bottle of water later and we resume our study session, but just a few paragraphs in, Trish interrupts me again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey, Anon?" That same tone of voice from earlier. Relax, Anon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah?" More confident than last time, at least.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I appreciate the studying help, but there is another reason I wanted you here." Oh fuck, I am not ready.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's about my mom." Oh, nevermind. Wait, what?</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh, what is it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, you heard her earlier, and I've talked about her a lot, she's kind of a bitch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Alright, but I don’t know how you would want my help with that. I’d only end up making things worse.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Actually, it’s quite simple. I need you to fuck my mom.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“WH-” My voice catches in my throat and I practically choke, violently coughing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What the fuck do you mean? Are you...oh, haha. I get it, you got me good there. Ha.” She smiles warmly at me, her face full of a sincerity and understanding that terrifies me, but stays quiet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You’re...you’re joking right?” Still quiet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What am I saying, of course you’re joking. You’re going to bust out laughing any second now, and I’m gonna laugh, and it’s gonna be funny.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m not joking, Anon.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What? Trish, I am not going to fuck your mom.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why not?” What the FUCK.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Because, I…” There are no wrong answers here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Because I like you.” Except maybe that one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh wow, Anon, you...you just cost me ten bucks.” What the fuck is happening to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Like, it was pretty obvious, but I didn’t think you’d actually say it.” I think I’m just going to curl up and die.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish slides over and wraps her arms around me, snapping me out of my spaghettastrophe.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Trish, do you…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Maybe…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Please, just an ounce of reassurance.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, if I say ‘yes’ now, it’ll be cheating when you go fuck my mom.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Trish, why on earth would I fuck your mom? I’m pretty sure she hates me anyway.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“See, that’s the thing - she really doesn’t. She just wants you to think she does to save face.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What the actual fuck are you talking about?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“She likes skinnies, you dumbass. A lot. She doesn’t like showing it, but she’s totally jealous that you’re here with me.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Okay, but that doesn’t answer why I should do this in the first place.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Like I said, she’s a bitch, and she’s gonna be a real bitch to me after you leave, and if I want to keep you around for more than a couple weeks, we’re going to need her to stop being a bitch. Which is where you come in. Pun not intended.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Slow down, I’m not exactly Casanovasaur, considering I nearly died like two minutes ago just saying that I liked you. I can’t go from that to seducing older women within minutes.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon, if I didn’t have the utmost confidence in you, I wouldn’t be asking. You might be a colossal fuck-up, but there is absolutely no way you can fuck this up.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“T-thanks?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You’re welcome. Now, listen closely, this is important. She’s gone through a few glasses of wine by now, so she’s not going to randomly gore you just for looking at her. You just need to sit on the couch right next to her. She’s gonna start bitching about skinnies, but it won’t last long, she’ll quiet down and start muttering about this and that, and that’s when you scooch over and wrap your arm around her. It’ll shut her up and make her blush, and that’s when you know you’re in. You don’t even need to say anything, she’ll pounce on you - in a good way, don’t worry - and from there you just let it happen. Just remember, don’t show weakness, but don’t be too aggressive either.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a minute to soak all of this information in and ask myself some questions. Is Trish worth it? Trish is cool and pretty and has nice boobs and is probably the closest I’ve been to a girlfriend in my entire life. Is fucking Trish's mom worth Trish? She seems to think it's a good idea if she wants to 'keep me around'. I feel like there might have been implications in that phrase that are currently lost on me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, alright."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Good, although I wasn't really asking in the first place." Of course she wasn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I stand up and face the door, suddenly not wanting to move anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't make me push you out there. I will."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright alright, jeez. I guess I'm gonna go...fuck your mom."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Have fun!" I walk into the hallway and close the door behind me. I can see the couch from here, a pair of horns sticking out from over the upper cushion, the TV tuned to some overdramatic trash. Raptor Jesus, protect me. I quietly shuffle forwards, eventually bringing myself around the arm and onto the cushion next to Trish's mom, quarter-glass of wine in hand. Hopefully not about to be in my skull.</div><div class="fanfic-line">In what should be completely unsurprising to me, she looks a lot like Trish. Incredibly purple from top to bottom, short, particularly well endowed. The only real difference, besides the age, is the tasteful thickness she had. It was hard to see the exact details under her casual wear, but she looks like she dated an architect at some point.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh great, now the fuckin' skinnie is parading around like he owns the damn place, like this isn't my fuckin' house, you think you…" Just like Trish said, she's ranting about skinnies. It's partially slurred, but it sounds like nonsense anyway so it probably didn't matter. I keep quiet and sure enough, the arant reduces to a murmur of speciesist epitaphs and swears. Alright. Now or nothing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wrap an arm around her, planting it on her opposite shoulder. She goes quiet immediately, and I can swear I heard a tiny yelp. I glance over and her purple face has turned a darker shade of purple, and she glances over to me. Our eyes meet, and for a few moments we just take each other in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a half-drunk triceratops, she's surprisingly agile as I suddenly find myself on my back, with the aforementioned dinosaur looking down at me and panting shamelessly. She leans down and aggressively plants her lips on mine. I wrap my arms around her and pull her into me, and she responds by grinding against my crotch and sticking her relatively massive herbivore tongue into my mouth. I thrust against her while trying to fight off the intrusive muscle in my mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She pulls away and straightens herself, sitting directly on my now-erect cock. She expertly gyrates her hips while taking her top off, and I can only desperately latch onto her love handles and hump upwards as she reveals her delectable curves and large purple breasts, the dark purple nipples hard and perked. She falls forward again, and the world goes a beautiful shade of purple as I'm buried in her breasts. I frantically kiss, lick and suck every inch I can find as I reach further down around her waist, pushing her pants off. She shifts her legs back and forth and I can hear the flick of fabric impacting something further off, and a hand violently yanks at my jeans button, ripping the articles off and exposing my dick.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She wastes no time pointing my member upwards and plunging herself down onto its entire length. She lets out an impassioned shout as I hilt her and she goes into an aroused frenzy, her hips slamming against mine over and over as she rides me like a crazed animal. The sounds of slapping, squelching and moaning echo off the walls and surely carry on through the rest of the house as my mind and body revert to primal instincts, dedicated only to giving this horned reptilian woman as much monkey dick as possible. Her inner walls rub against my most sensitive spots as I hungrily try to plunge deeper than is even possible. She lets out a guttural moan and I feel her body tense and muscles contract against me, the sudden sensation causing me to echo her as it pushes me closer to the edge.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It eventually becomes too much, my hungry thrusts become rapid jackhammers as I reach the end of my rope, and another sudden contraction sends me screaming over the edge, waves of orgasmic pleasure washing over us as I fill her with cum and send my final parting thrusts before we collapse into each other.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The only sound left is that of our breathing. I look over and her eyes are shut, her limbs completely limp. I bask in the afterglow for a precious few more minutes before the reality of the situation starts to creep in. Just a bit longer…</div><div class="fanfic-line">I just fucked Trish's mom. Like holy shit. I was supposed to be studying and I fucked my best friend's mom. She told me to and probably wouldn't have taken no for an answer, but that's besides the point.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Raptor Jesus as my witness if that smug purple slut calls me a motherfucker one time I'm using her horns as handlebars the first opportunity I get.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Slowly but surely I wiggle myself out from under the passed out mom, and put my clothes back on. I groggily walk back to Trish's room and invite myself in, then collapse against her bed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"See? Told you it was fine." I blissfully murmur nothing in particular.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You're welcome, motherfucker." Trish snorts at her own awful joke and I groan. Handlebars for you, it is. Later.</div>
