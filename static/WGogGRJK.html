Fang and Anon never get to meet each other when this event happens.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As time goes on, Anon finds himself in a difficult position of near homelessness as jobs and money becomes harder to find.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One day he bumps into a familiar stegosaurus, decked out in fancy clothing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>While comparatively, Anon hadn't showered since the day before, and his clothing has become rough from the manual washes he's had to do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Anon? Ohmigosh! Is that you, bud?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon realizes that voice was familiar, positively familiar at that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's eyes widened when he realized the suited up, expensive looking woman in front of him was none-other than Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh gosh... S...Stella? Wow, it's uh...been a while...yea. How're you doing?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella looks Anon up and down, a sweet smile coming to her face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"How am I doing? Lookityou, Anon! You look miserable, big guy! Hey. Come with me. You got a your own place? Anything like that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon looks down, remembering the Apartment landlord told him not to comeback unless he had the money, which regretfully, he did not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All Anon had on him was his backpack containing a laptop, a few pairs of spare clothing, a sandwich, and a single knife...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Living the dream...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Don't got the money for my place, all I got is what's on my back on the clothes I got on."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A frustrated, defeated sigh escapes the human as Stella wraps him in a surprise hug.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Come to think of it...what the hell is Stella doing around Skinrow?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon ponders this and asks the dinosaur that question.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella smiles and sticks out her tongue.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I work around here, silly! I'm actually the COO of a game company around these parts in Volcadera Heights. The company's called SO_LO. Pretty well known."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon could hear the smug coming from her voice, but considering how high the position she had was, it was probably well deserved.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yet that didn't answer his other, unspoken question...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Wait. Why do you want me to come with you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella tilted her head innocently with a smile that felt almost plastic, but he didn't try to let it get to him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Well, considering you gave me a literal reason, not much of a way to refuse me now, huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon felt flustered and stuttered. "W-well... I guess no-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Good! Now come on, dummy. I bet you're starving. After something to eat, a nice hot shower and a warm bed's in order for my favorite human."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon felt something nag at the back of his head at that, but fuck it. Free food and a free shower to go with a bed? Who could pass that up?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If only he realized sooner what he was getting himself into...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It had only been a few weeks after Anon had "moved in" with Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His own room, food, warm bedding, everything. The whole package. Anon was in heaven.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was like a dream come true, Stella coming to practically rescue him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One thing that piqued Anon's curiosity however was the fact that she bought him clothes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In fact, Stella bought Anon a LOT of things. Whatever he might've wanted at one point, he'd find it in his room one way or another.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon felt kind of guilty by the fact that Stella had been buying him so many gifts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She even went so far as to start getting him clothes for him to wear.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After some time, it'd already been a good few months, and Anon was safe to say, he'd pretty much moved in with Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What surprised Anon was the size of her house. For one lady, it was quite something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Three bedrooms, two of them with their own bathrooms, two full extra bathrooms, and a single half bathroom near the kitchen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Did he mention the fucking kitchen? It was ginormous, giant island counter in the middle of it and everything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All of the kitchen-ware a chef or housewife could dream of.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Currently Anon and Stella were conversing in said kitchen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Jeesh, do you use this whole kitchen, Stella? It's kinda huge for just one person."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The smile she gave him seemed strained almost, but still she persevered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh you know. I try! With you here though, I can finally show someone my cooking skills for once."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That's another thing Anon found he enjoyed about his new residence.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Free, homecooked food every single day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Boy, life was grand. A cute woman took care of his needs, what else could make this better?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He thought that over and over now, in his newest situation...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella was at his door in nothing but a shirt. Her eyes stared into his, it felt like he was staring at his a completely different person...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"St...Stella? What-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Before he could finish his question, Stella rushed in, pushing him down to his bed with incredible speed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon could barely get a sentence out, let alone any kind of noise of protest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not only was Stella constantly moving, the way she moved, practically wrapping herself around Anon, made it impossible to do a single thing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was all over him, huffing what he assumed was his scent, licking him in places he felt a bit too embarrassed to think about.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There was finally a pause in the sexual harassments for Anon to catch a break. The darkness of the room made it hard to see his feminine assailant on top of him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All he could see... The hunger in those brilliant blue eyes. It made him feel like a piece of meat being devoured by a predator.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He felt shuffling near his groin, fabric being moved, wetness, then this tightness. He had to grit his teeth to keep himself from finishing right then and there.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella began moving up and down in a frantic, irregular pattern, nothing but release on her mind it seemed. Anon decided to just let it happen for now...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>While it hadn't bothered him too much, it felt like he was being taken advantage of right now. The way she just took charge, whether he was comfortable or not...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Might as well take advantage of the situation as much as he can then. Grabbing onto Stella's rear, he started pushing himself in further, much to her agreement.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"That's it, Anon... Just a little longer. I'm close. Are you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He opted to keep silent for now, not that she seemed to care too much. She went back to stuffing her face into his neck, taking long huffs of him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Shit... Stella. I'm getting close..." She responded by going faster, even wrapping herself tighter around Anon. He didn't like where this was going.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If she didn't get off soon, he might finish inside, and he was NOT ready to become a father now. It was too late though, she wrapped herself around him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was near impossible to get her off him. "Oh God! Stella, please! I'm gonna cum inside! Get off, hurry!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Poor choice of words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh God Anon you have no idea~! A little more, I'm close!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"S-Stella that's not what I meant! *hah* I meant I'll f-finish Ihhhn You!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was too much. He felt Stella shudder as she tightened up down there. It was coming, just like how Stella was right now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It shot out so fast and hard, Anon could swear he saw white around his vision, his body felt like it was melting from the action.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella wasn't stopping, instead, riding their orgasms out to the very last bit. Anon felt himself be drained of his strength.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He just came inside Stella. She was more than likely pregnant...but right now he could care less.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He's never felt that way before with a partner. While this wasn't his first rodeo, this was his first amazing one, that was for certain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yet he realized he'd practically been used like a sex toy by Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Stella..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All he felt was the slow, rhythmic breathing of a sleeping Stella. Shit...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He was even still inside her... She didn't bother trying to slip him out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But he just stopped caring at this point. His body hurt with exhaustion from what just happened.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Instead, maybe it was time to just sleep. Maybe this would blow over at some point...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Who knows. All he knew was that he just got sexually assaulted by a cute Stegosaurus.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Guess it's true that weebs have the most sexual energy of them all. Anon chuckled to himself at that thought.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His last thought was of him and Stella having a kid. While this would've worried him, he was too far into the lull of sleep to fully realize it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Soon, he joined Stella in her slumber, both of their sweaty bodies never once separating from one another.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The end...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>???</div>
