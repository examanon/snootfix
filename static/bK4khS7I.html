                    <div class="fanfic-line">Chapter 2: After School</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘Fuck. Monday. Why do Mondays exist again...?’</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda lets out a giggle and puts a hand on my shoulder. “Because all good things have to end?” the pink raptor walking next to me asks as she smiles. “I mean, if the party kept going on ‘n on, it wouldn’t end up meaning anything. It’d be so passe and boring!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’m very tempted to berate myself for my mumbling habit once again. Something about seeing Reeda get a kick out of it makes me reconsider, though. At this point, she doesn’t seem to care at all that about it. If anything, she seems to have embraced it faster than even my parents had.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Damn. If that isn’t sad, I don’t know what is.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, Reeda has a good point. Stuff has to end. Going back to school and mundanity may be awful, but it makes what happened during the weekend all the more meaningful.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And shit, a lot happened during that weekend with Reeda...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">On Friday, Reeda and I smoked and drank way into the night. I even ended up getting tugged by the beautiful pink raptor now walking beside me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">On Saturday, we beat up and ripped off a cheating dealer, had ourselves some semi-decent pizza and bought ourselves some good groceries with the money, and then began our life together as a couple.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sunday was our most low-key day. We both slept well past noon. When we woke up some time at one in the afternoon, we decided to spend the rest of the day playing Rock Ring and watching Reeda’s surprisingly good old-school anime recommendations, all the while cuddling together and enjoying each other’s company. I even took the opportunity to play some more with Reeda’s tail fluff. That’s fast becoming my favorite pastime.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘I’m just so blessed that my stunning dino gee eff thinks it’s both adorable and funny,’ I think, the corners of my mouth stretching wide as I no doubt put on a big goofy smile to match the almost afterglow-like satisfaction that comes from the memory of Reeda’s soft fuzzy tail.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda lets out a snort and gives me a light tap on the shoulder, no doubt in response to my mumblings. She doesn’t say anything as she gives me a sideways glance. Instead, her cheeks only turn redder by the second.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As we walk towards our respective homeroom classes, we notice that this part of the hallway is deserted. Either we were super early, or we were super late. Whatever the case may be, it doesn’t matter. It’s Monday, and most homeroom teachers excuse tardies anyway. A few of the teachers themselves came in late from time to time themselves.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As suddenly as she had smiled, Reeda stops in her tracks. It takes me a few extra steps to catch on to that fact as I backpedal back to her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Everything alright?” I ask, not sure what had caused my girlfriend to stop walking—or smiling, for that matter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Listen, Anon…” she starts, looking me deep into my eyes. “We’re an item now. Nothing’s changing that short you doing something stupid, like cheating on me…” She lets out a sigh and moves a bit closer to me. Close enough that we’re almost at kissing distance. “...But… I’m still… afraid…” She brings a hand to rub the back of her head. As she does, she glances sideways, almost as if looking into my eyes was becoming difficult for her to do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I give my girlfriend a soft smile and wrap her in a hug. “I know what you’re thinking,” I say, in reality only half-confident that what I was about to say was the truth. “You’re still afraid about what everyone will think about our relationship.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Y-yes…” Reeda stammers as she tightens her embrace. “I know we talked about this before... and you told me you don’t care… but I…” I hear my rose-toned gee eff let out a sigh as she breaks the embrace before backing up a few steps. “I don’t want to ruin what we have with fucking drama…” She grabs her arm and looks down at the floor. “So… can I… can I ask you a favor? A damn cruel favor...?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A part of me already knows what Reeda's going to ask of me. Our relationship wouldn’t be easy to maintain while at school. Reputation needs sustaining, and all that stupid high school hierarchy bullshit never leads to anything other than unnecessary grief for everyone involved. Still, it was almost a social law among the students, and while I couldn’t give less of a fuck about any of that, I know that isn’t the case for my girlfriend. She’s in a band. She’s the school mascot. She’s among the most popular girls in Volcano High, both for her charms and her ability to dispense drugs at the drop of a hat. It wasn’t like with Fang, where everyone already viewed her as that one ‘monochromatic weirdo,’ or with Trish, who… well, was Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The idea of Reeda dating the strange transfer student—a human, no less—could lead to some nasty rumors. That’s something I won’t put her through if I can avoid it. I already owe her too much for giving my sorry ass a second shot at love.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a bit of pain in my chest, I plant a soft kiss on Reeda's cheek. “I’ll see you later then,” I tell her as I move past her, ready to put my mind and hormones away for the sake of my new lover, even if a part of my heart felt like it was dying in the process.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Wait!” Reeda abruptly shouts as she grabs me by the hand, stopping me in my tracks. She looks around the deserted hallway once again. When she confirms that we are the only other people in sight, she smiles wide and warm. Before I can say or do anything, she yanks me back to her side and plants a deep kiss on my lips, one that couldn’t have lasted more than thirty seconds but to me felt like a beautiful eternity.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">When Reeda breaks the kiss, she wraps me in a tight and loving embrace, her arms holding on tight as if she doesn’t want to let me go, and her tail coiling around my legs and hips in what I can only assume is some kind of possessive instinct.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of course, I return the hug with as much passion as I can manage. What kind of boyfriend would I be if I didn’t?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I promise… I’ll make it up to ya,” Reeda tells me as her tail coils around me tighter. “Just… just…” She tries to say something else, but she can only let out another sigh as she slowly unwraps her tail and backs away. “Just wait until—”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*BING-BONG-BING-BONG*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda doesn’t get a chance to finish her words as the bell chimes, signaling to the two of us that were now indeed tardy to class.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I point to Reeda and grin, all the while walking backward. “See you in math class!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Don’t do anything too stupid, ya hear!?” Reeda shouts at me as she too begins walking back. The two of us keep doing this, almost as if we don’t want to break eye contact with one another. Alas, we are both forced to turn around and go our separate ways.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At least for the time being.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I do, I can’t help but wonder what Reeda had planned for after school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shouldn’t be grinning as widely as I am right now. I probably look like some deranged psycho coming to shoot up the school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As if something like that could ever happen in the cereal-mascot-filled Volcano High…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">***</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's been about four hours since the start of school. I’m now sitting in math class thinking to myself how boring numbers are. Like, do they mean anything in the grand scheme of things? Wouldn’t it be easier to, I don’t know, wing it or something?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of course not. Just like with English and science, math is essential for everyday work. Too bad I’m fucking terrible at it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Alright, you bunch o’ slackers, I’ma break you into groups of two. Finish all the exercises on page sixty and try to keep it down. Gots a bit of a headache today,” Mr. Carldelewski says as he sits back on his desk and pulls out his usual math book, which he uses as a convenient shield to hide the romance novels he reads daily.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before I have a chance even to think who I’m going to partner up with, Reeda takes a seat across from me, her usual hazed-over eyes meeting mine, at which point she gives me a sly grin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“R-Reeda?” I ask, swiveling my head side to side to make sure there weren’t any eyes on us. When I’m convinced no one’s looking at us, I lower my head and try to hide my face behind my math book. “W-what are you—”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before I can finish my words, Reeda lets out a yawn, sits back on her chair, and looks me in the eye, her grin not once wavering. “Don’t worry, dude. I know how much of a pain in the ass math is for ya, so I’m doing my favorite human the favor of helping him today.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What about Trish?” I ask, doing my best to keep my voice down and subtle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Trish went to the John. Knowing her, she’ll be gone at least twenty minutes.” Reeda blinks a few times, no doubt noticing my confused stare. “Weren’tcha paying attention?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Not… really,” I reply truthfully. Math class as a whole's one big blank spot for me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda lets out a giggle as she sits up. “My dude, ya gotta pay a bit more attention in class. What’cha gonna do when I’m not around to help you anymore?” Reeda asks cheekily at first, but her expression changes from amusement to what looks like sadness, then back to amusement again before she closes her eyes and lets out a chuckle. “I-I mean... yeah, math’s REAL boring, my dude! Can’t blame ya for not paying it any attention! No siree, don’t blame you none...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before I can ask Reeda what she means by her words, she reaches into her notebook and produces a crumpled-up piece of paper. She places the paper on top of my desk and slides it in my direction wordlessly, all the while trying to look as innocent as she can.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I know the drill by now. With practiced sneakiness, I grab the paper and place it among my belongings, unfurling it over and reading all the already answered questions assigned by Mr. Carldelewski.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’ll never not be thankful to Reeda for being the only reason I haven’t flunked out of math yet. It makes me wonder just how smart she is under all the carfe and weed, and just how far she can go in life if she were to drop both vices...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So,” Reeda starts, once again leaning back on her chair in an attempt to appear relaxed and inconspicuous. “How’s the day been for you so far?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well,” I start, all the while writing down all Reeda’s notes into my notebook, “Homeroom wasn’t too bad. Naomi gave the same ‘I’m so disappointed in you' look she’s been giving me for the last week, but other than that, nothing else happened. Didn’t even get marked late.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda lets out a scoff. “That pink tyrant still pissed off about the whole Fang break-up?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah. Like she should fucking care about my lovelife,” I hiss out. Of course, I omit the real reason Naomi hates me guts is because I ruined her plan of ‘fixing’ fang so she'd stop being such a drain on Naser’s life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’m very tempted to tell Reeda all about that bullshit plan, but I get the feeling that would only lead to some drama between the class president and the members of VVrum Drama. That’s the last thing I want. It may not look it, but I want to end my time in Volcano High on a positive note and not on some dramatic bull that’ll leave me traumatized for years to come.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Man, fuck Naomi,” Reeda snaps loud enough to get her annoyance across. “Just because she’s class prez doesn’t give her the right to try and control everyone’s life.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘Oh, you have no idea how right you are about Naomi,’ I find myself thinking before realizing I might have said that out loud. Regardless, I don’t see Reeda react, so I move on to my next set of words. “First and second periods were boring as usual. Not much to report there. Science was so excruciating, what with Fang still being my lab partner…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda gives me a surprised look. “Farnsworth still hasn’t switched you two around?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shake my head in response, causing Reeda to put a hand on my shoulder. “Damn... that sucks,” she whispers as she gives me an apologetic look. I can tell from her gaze that she wants so badly to hug me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I bitterly chuckle and give my gee eff a soft smile. I don’t say anything to her, as there isn’t anything I can tell her that wouldn’t come off as some kind of pity party.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well… I know what’ll cheer you up,” Reeda announces as she again leans back on her chair. “Wanna come to VVrum Drama's practice after school?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’m kinda taken aback by the sudden suggestion. Not that I don’t want to go, it’s just that the idea of it strikes me as… odd, especially considering how careful we were trying to be about our relationship.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You sure?” I ask Reeda as I lean in closer so I can keep my voice lower. “I mean, Trish and Fang are still pissed off at me...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Don’t worry about Fang, fam!” Reeda cheers in a hushed tone. “Just because you two broke up doesn’t mean you’re barred from attending our practices. I mean, you’re the reason we even got that gig at Moe’s in the first place. You’re our fucking hero!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda sure knows how to make me feel all warm and fuzzy. God, how I wish I could give her a kiss in reply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, even if Fang didn’t give me shit for being there, that didn’t stop a certain purple triceratops from giving me shit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What about Trish?” I ask, well aware that my tone soon as I say her name is… less than enthusiastic, to put it mildly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You’re not going to practice to watch Trish. You’re going to practice to see the band. And me.” Reeda says, all the while letting out a snicker and giving me the warmest simper she can manage. “Okay, your ass is only going to practice to see me!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Got me on that one,” I reply, inching a bit closer to my girlfriend. Reeda sits up straight again, bites her bottom lip, and moves in a bit closer too. Before we have the chance to lose ourselves in the moment, we both stop before we are anywhere near kissing distance. We stare at each other for a second before we laugh and retreat to our usual sitting positions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I suddenly feel Reeda’s hand wrap around mine as she gives me a soft, melancholic gaze. “I… I also want you there for support..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I mean, sure!” I say almost instantly before realizing that something isn’t quite right with Reeda’s request. “But hold on… you’ve... never really needed support before. Or have you?” I feel cold at the thought. ‘Oh god, what if she’s needed someone to lean on for so long and I never noticed because of my fixation on Fang? What kind of shitty friend would that make me?!’</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda giggles as she tightens her grip on my hand. “Silly Anon! Someone doesn’t need to be in distress to enjoy some good-ol’ support!” Her cheeks grow bright red as she looks me in the eyes. “But there’s also the fact that… up until now, I never had a boyfriend. And now that I do, I don’t want to waste a single second of it...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I still think this is a bad idea, but seeing Reeda’s expression, her desire for me to be there for her, even though it goes against what we agreed to do earlier today… I can’t bring myself to say no. What kind of boyfriend would I be if I did that?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Okay,” I say, gently caressing Reeda’s hand. “I’ll be there to see you rock out.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s expression brightens to such an extent that I’m almost fearful that she’s about to jump on top of my desk and shout in jubilation. Of course, she’s able to keep herself in check as she instead lets out what sounds to be a sound somewhere between a squee and a dreamy sigh. I’m not sure of which it is, though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Nice, my dude!” Reeda cheers as she looks around to make sure there aren’t any prying eyes on us before leaning in closer. “We’re meeting at Jingo’s class. Make sure you get there at least half an hour late, or else Trish and Fang might suspect something’s up.” She lets out another giggle as she fixes me with seductive eyes. “Soon as we finish practice, we’re gonn—”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s words get cut off altogether when the classroom door flies open. In steps Trish sporting an expression somewhere between pissed and dour. If I had to take a guess, one of the teachers told her to hurry back to class and not waste so much time in the bathroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda and I let go of each other’s hands. She leans back on her chair and pretends to act all aloft. I turn my full attention back to copying the math work Reeda passed on to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without a word, the triceratops places the hall pass back in its hook and she marches up to Reed and myself. I only chance a glance upwards to Trish, who gives me a smug, almost pitiful look as she finally stands next to my desk.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Still having to mooch off of Reeda’s work just to pass the class?” Trish asks, not even bothering to wait for my answer before shaking her head and clicking her tongue. “God, you’re such a pathetic monkey. Bet you can’t even count to twenty without imagining bananas or some shit like that.” She turns her attention to Reeda, a grimace on her face. “C’mon, let’s ditch this skinnie loser. He’s a lost cause anyway,” she says, the level of vitriol on her tone so high I’m surprised her breath isn’t corrosive.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish shoots me one final glare before turning around and walking to her desk, hands in her hoodie pockets.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda stands up and follows her, but not before shooting me an apologetic glance before also turning around.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I do my best not to let Trish’s words get to me too much.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hell of a lot harder than I’d like to admit, though...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">***</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*BING-BONG-BING-BONG*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That’s the last bell for the day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Right on cue, my sixth-period classmates all get up from their seats and start filling out like a mass of ants, eager to get out of school for their well-earned afternoon of relaxation. Well, except for those who have sports, clubs, heavy amounts of homework, or other shit like that. This being Volcano High, I’d say more than half of my peers had shit to do after school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don’t know if it's the environment or the fact that my new school’s more on the private than the public side, but for some ungodly reason, everyone seems like some kind of overachiever. Nothin at all like back in Rock Bottom, where it was get in, do your work, and get out without looking back. Even the clubs were half-assed. In comparison, the clubs here in Volcano High, seem catered to help you make something of yourself. It makes me glad I haven’t joined any of them, and that’s not for lack of trying. Rosa and Stella are both still trying to get me to join the gardening club, and Milhouse’s been nagging me to join the VA club. Guess he can smell my weebish nature as much as Stella can.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I pack my stuff slow as a snail and wait for everyone to file out before I also leave the classroom. I’m tempted to make my way straight to Mr. Jingo’s room, but then I remember what Reeda told me about being early, and I find myself slowing my pace down. Eventually, I fall into a sluggish pace as I make my way to my locker first.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Normally, I’d toss everything I didn’t need for my afternoon in without much of a care. Seeing as I have the extra time, I tell myself that my locker needs a bit of organizing. Need to burn time anyway. I start taking out old assignment papers and leftover scraps of stationery.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A few trips to the nearest recycling bin, I have twice as much room in my locker as I had before. I then stuff all my belongings inside save for my backpack and shut the locker, marveling at how much lighter my bag now felt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Looking down at the time on my phone, I let out a groan. I've only managed to burn ten minutes. With nothing else to do with my locker, I head for the cafeteria and sit my ass down on an empty table before bringing out my phone and engaging in a bit of shitposting.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I sift through my favored forums and reply to various threads with baits, trolls, and the occasional bit of encouragement for good replies, a full twenty minutes pass. I ask myself if thirty minutes is enough time, but I’m too fucking impatient to keep waiting anymore. I get back up, make a quick pit-stop at the bathroom, and make my way to the third floor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The instant I make it up the stairs, my ears catch the sounds of music coming from Jingo’s class, which is at the far end of the hallway. As I hear the melodic sounds of the guitar, bass, and drums, I can’t help but smile to myself. Hard to believe that three months earlier, VVrum Drama was trying to play music with two basses. The idea had been Trish’s, though, which made me question if she even knew what music really was.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I approach the door, I find myself stopping, butterflies forming in my gut. Ever since my break-up with Fang, I haven’t been to a single one of VVrum Drama’s practices. If the situation were the same, I wouldn’t even be standing where I am right now. Aside from supporting the band I had helped grow a bit, there was no real reason for me to be at their practice. Even so, my reason for showing up today was different. Someone wanted me there. That still didn’t stop me from feeling like I was about to step into a place I no longer belong in…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I pull out my phone and consider texting Reeda some excuse not to step inside for a second. She probably wouldn’t see it until her practice was over, but she’d at least know why I was a no-show.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a deep breath and inch my finger closer to the screen, preparing myself to type my pitiful excuse for why I was flaking…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stop in my tracks, grimacing at my cowardice. Shit like this was why Fang broke off our relationship. I wasn’t strong back then, nor did I try to be strong. I ran away like a pussy instead, fearful of committing to someone that wasn’t me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But not this time. My insecurities weren’t going to get the better of me this time. I’ll be damned if I let Reeda down as I did Fang…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I stuff my phone in my pocket, take a deep breath as if I’m about to plunge myself into the deep end of a pool, and open the door. As soon as I do, Trish stops strumming on her bass, which prompts the rest of the band to stop playing as well.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon!?” Trish shouts the instant all other sounds die out. “What the FUCK are you doing here!?” she snaps at me, her voice as vitriolic as when she had last addressed me in math class.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don’t give Trish a reply. Instead, I set my gaze on Fang and Reeda.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang looks at me with what I can only describe as cold fury. She seems ready to snap at me as well, but she instead lets out a scoff and turns her eyes away, almost as if looking at me gave her physical discomfort.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda, meanwhile, looks at me with wide-eyed ecstasy. I can tell from the way her tail is flicking side to side that she’s barely containing whatever excitement is coursing through her being.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish puts her bass down and hops off the small stage, her expression growing sourer and sourer by the second.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey, monkey!” Trish shouts, a shit-eating grin forming on her lips as she makes her way towards me. “Didn’t you hear my question? What the fuck are you doing here!?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Realizing that Trish was putting me on the spot, I crossed my arms and put on my best-feigned look of confidence. “I came to see how my friends’ practice is going. You know, since I haven’t shown up in a week.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish’s expression becomes one of fury as she closes the last bit of distance between us. “Came to see your friends!? What the fuck are you on, you god-damned spear-chucker? You have no friends!” Trish jabs me in the chest, her expression not once changing from a nasty scowl of rage. “We barely tolerated your ass before. Now, you have absolutely NO reason to show your face here!” The fucking trigger jabs me one final time, her clawed finger digging into my body with enough force that I can almost feel the nail piercing the skin under my clothes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Get this through that thick troglodyte skull of yours…” Trish leans in so close to me that if we were of similar heights, we’d be pressing foreheads with each other. “You. Are. Not. Welcome. Here. Anymore!” The small trig ends her final word by shoving me away. Despite my best effort to stay rooted, her push is hard enough to cause me to stagger a bit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Chillax, Trish!” Reeda interjects in her oh-so-ever chill and laid-back voice. “Anon’s got every right to chillax with us. I mean, he’s practically part of the band!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish turns to glare at Reeda with fire in her eyes. “No, he fucking isn’t!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda puts on a grimace as she crosses her arms. “Okay, what the fuck’s crawled up your ass? You’ve been NOTHING but a hardass towards Anon today.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why am I a hardass!?” Trish repeats, whatever fury she was once directed at me now getting directed at Reeda. “Did you already forget what he did to Fang!?” the small dino shouts, all the while pointing at Fang, who opts to turn her entire head away from me in disgust.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s brows furrow at Trish’s words, the fire growing in her eyes telling me that she’s doing everything she can to keep the rage from showing in her face. “What happened between Anon and Fang's got nothing to do with him coming to see us rock out!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What the fuck are you talking about!?” Trish yells as she again turns to face me, her glare so sharp that I almost feel the urge to move out of the way, lest I get cut by it. “Anon’s presence is disruptive. Plus, he showed up uninvited. As manager of the band, I’m exercising my power to kick out his uninvited ass.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh, so now we have to invite people if we want them to come to see our practices?” Reeda snaps. By the rising tone of her voice, I can tell she’s about to lose her cool.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“That’s how it’s always been!” Trish barks, once again turning around to look at Reeda. “Don’t fucking tell me you invited his ass over!?” she asks, all the while pointing an accusatory finger at my girlfriend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I…” Reeda starts, but she shuts her mouth. She shoots me a glance before blinking, her expression going back to one of chill indifference. “I didn’t invite Anon. But that shouldn’t matter. He’s still our friend. We don’t do this kind of shit to friends, do we?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish turns back to look at me and then back to Reeda. As she does, she narrows her eyes in what I can only assume is contemplation. “Anon’s no friend of mine, and he’s certainly no friend of Fang anymore.” Trish finally turns entirely around, setting her questioning gaze at Reeda. “The only one that Anon’s still ‘friends’ with is you!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda smiles at her friend and points a pair of finger guns in her direction. “Yup. Anon’s a super chill dude. ‘Course I’m still friends with him. Why wouldn’t I?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish crosses her arms, her gaze only narrowing further. “Tell me then, were you ‘hanging out’ with him this last weekend?” Trish asks, all the while fixing Reeda with an almost accusatory glare. “Because you sure as hell weren’t home, and you weren’t picking up any of my calls either.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh fuck…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh shit!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Does Trish suspect something!?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This… this shit’s too risky for Reeda to deal with. If she messes up and lets anything slip, it’ll reveal that she spent the weekend with me. Fucking Trish can then put two and two together, and who knows what she’ll fucking do then. Probably nothing good going by how anal she’s being about me showing up to practice in the first place...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda lets out a hearty laugh and doubles over. Much to my surprise, she even wipes a few tears from her eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Have to give Reeda props on her acting there…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh my fucking god!” Reeda shouts as she shoots me a look of absolute disgust, one that I can’t deny fucking hurts me. “You really think I’d spend the weekend with Anon!?” she asks, once again laughing and once again wiping away tears. “Like, Anon’s a bro ‘n all, but he’s too much of a… well, a weirdo! No offense,” she adds, shooting me a glance before returning her full attention to Trish. “You think I’d do anything with Anon? ‘Common! I have higher standards!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck. That… that hurts. Feels like a dagger straight to the heart…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I chance a glance between my three ‘friends’ and absorb each of their expressions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish looks mildly pleased with the words coming out of Reeda’s mouth. Of course, she would be…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang looks annoyed. Not at the fact that Reeda’s words were harmful to my persona, but more at the implication that her standards were somehow low for having dated me in the first place...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s expression is too hard to read. She looks sure of her own words in a way that disturbs me, yet there’s something else, but I can’t tell what that is, nor do I want to right now, going by the pain slowly spreading out from where my heart is...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, if you didn’t spend the weekend ‘hanging’ with Anon, then what the fuck were you doing?” Trish asks, all the while crossing her arms.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Family stuff,” Reeda responds without wasting a second. “I was out of town. Didn’t give ya a call back because I got super busy and forgot. Sorry, amiga...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish pinches the bridge of her nose at Reeda’s response, but she at least seems to buy it wholly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I let out a soft sigh of relief. At least Reeda has shit locked down on her end. Meanwhile, every second I remained inside Mr. Jingo’s room was another second that threatened to blow Reeda’s whole cover story…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, with that shit sorted out...” Trish coldly snaps as she turns her attention back to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before I can even get a word in—not that I intended to anyway—Trish pushes me out of the music room. I don’t resist at all as she shoves me into the hallway, all the while giving me a shifty, nasty glare. I don’t even make a sound or make a face as I turn around and start walking away. As I do, I can’t help but feel a pain in my chest as Reeda’s words bounce around in my head. I so desperately want to believe that she faked every word she said, but her tone, expression, laughter… it all felt too real for comfort…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My mind’s in such a mess that I miss the buzzing and vibration of my phone and Trish’s words that ring out not long after.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“If it’s not fucking clear by now, you’re not welcome to our practices, you god-damned knuckle-dragger,” Trish spits out. I don’t need to turn around to know that she’s giving me the most hateful glare that she can give me. “I don’t know what the fuck you and Reeda have going on, but I’m warning you right now, you stay the fuck away from her, or I swear I’m going to make you regret ever transferring to our school...” she hisses through gritted teeth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Those words make me feel like someone tossed ice into the pit of my stomach. I don’t even get a chance to form some form of retort, as the next thing I hear is the slamming of the door with such force that I’m surprised the glass on it didn't shatter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’m left standing there, unable to process the words Trish had told me. Once again, fears that she suspected something arose in me. But if she did suspect something, how had she come to that conclusion? Did she somehow come to it because of my interactions with Reeda? No. That can’t be it. We haven’t done anything to even hint at our relationship.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Was it the fact that I had come to practice today? No. That also couldn’t be it. I made it clear I was there for the band’s sake and nothing else.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The only thing that comes to mind is Reeda’s revelation that she still thought of me as a 'chill bro' and a friend. But was that enough for Trish to come up with such a conclusion about us?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck… this is going to haunt me for the rest of the evening, isn’t it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a sigh, I resign myself to my current fate. Whatever plans I had with Reeda were over. Trish will probably keep her in practice well into the evening, by which point it will be too dark and too late to do anything of consequence. Not that my girlfriend will even be up for anything anymore. Assuming she still wants to do anything with me going forward, considering what she said about me…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I remember the text I got earlier while getting chewed by Trish. I don’t want to open it, but it could be important. ‘Yeah, as if,’ I think to myself. The only people who could be texting me were Stella or Rosa. If it was Rosa, it was another attempt to invite me to join her gardening club. If it was Stella, it was another attempt to ask me to another anime night. Neither option sounded at all appealing to me right now. The only thing that can soothe me is Reeda’s presence.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, better to see who texted me than to live with the doubt…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I bring out my phone and open my text app. To my surprise, the message is from none other than Reeda. I wonder how she managed to send the message out so fast, but then again, Reeda’s a pro drummer, so I’m sure she’s got real speedy fingers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I tap open the message and read its contents:</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reeda]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sry to toss u undr bus</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait for me in bck of skol</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Plz</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My heart flutters a bit at reading Reeda’s text. A part of me wants to think the worst, that she’ll meet me only to reveal that it’s not gonna work, ending our relationship before it ever had a chance to start.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to bury that fear away in the recesses of my mind. ‘Reeda’s too awesome to abandon me over something as petty as her friends and band…’ I muse as I start making my way to the back of the school as my girlfriend asked me to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The more I walk, the more I ponder my previous thoughts, though. It takes me less than two minutes to realize that Reeda’s well within her rights to dump my ass if it means keeping her friends and her role in VVrum Drama. She at least has a shot of going somewhere with them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not with me. What do I have to offer? I’ve neither money nor talent. Judging by my barely passing grades, it doesn’t seem like I have much of a future either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That, above all else, terrifies me…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">***</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It’s been almost an hour since Reeda last texted me about waiting for her in the back of the school. I let out a sigh and look at my phone again. As I do, I can’t help but have her words echo in my mind over and over again like an incessant swarm of hornets…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘You really think I’d do anything with Anon? ‘Common! I have higher standards!’</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The fucking truth is that I know Reeda’s right. She’s beautiful, charming, and talented enough to get anybody else in the world. Yet, for some reason that eludes me, she's chosen me to be her boyfriend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">FUCK!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I grab my head and try to get the thoughts out of my mind. I try; I try so fucking hard, but the doubt returns harsher than before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don’t get it; I don’t. What does Reeda see in me...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before my thoughts can further darken my mood, I hear a door practically explode open. I snap my head in the direction of the sound and see Reeda storming out of the building, face beet red and her every step a stomp. I can almost see the steam coming from her nostrils as she grabs the door and tries to slam it shut, only for the mechanism to prevent that. She kicks the door close with a roar of fury and then kicks it again for good measure. She then punches the wall beside the door and lets out a long string of colorful curses that I just barely make out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“...Fucking Trish… thinking she can do that to shit...!” I barely make out Reeda’s last sentence as she again punches the wall, all the while bearing sharp teeth that evolution has done very little to make less threatening in appearance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I stand up from my bench and take a step forward. “R-Reeda?” I meekly call out, my insecurities once again getting the better of me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My girlfriend finally turns to see me, and the instant she does, she puts on a teary-eyed grimace. She sprints towards me, and before I can process her presence or what little I was able to make out of her words, she grabs my hand and starts dragging me away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don’t fight Reeda’s pull. I only fall behind her, all the while her hands hold on to mine so tightly that it feels as if she’s holding on to me for dear life. I follow my girlfriend as she leads me out of school grounds, across the street, and away from Volcano High.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We walk for what feels like hours. During that time, I keep my mouth shut, not sure if I should even say anything. For all I know, Reeda’s pissed off at me. I definitely could have handled things with Trish so much better. I could have tried joking around, apologizing to the tiny trigga, doing anything other than standing around taking her insults. But no, I opted to act like an idiot, forcing my girlfriend to threaten to blow our cover, all because of my inability to be helpful for once in my life...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Finally, after we are at least a good two miles away from Volcano High, Reeda comes to a complete stop. She lets go of my hand and stomps forward a few feet. As she does, her whole body begins to quake, and her face once more turns a bright red. Five seconds later, she lets out a yell to the skies. Her shout lasts for an impressive thirty seconds before she eases on her vocal cords and leans against a nearby high-fence, at which point she buries her face in her hands and lets out what sounds like a restrained sob.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a step forward and put a hand on Reeda’s shoulder. “A-are you… okay?” I ask, not sure if my voice or presence is what my girlfriend needs at the moment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s body stiffens at my touch. She lowers her hands from her face, revealing pink cheeks and puffy shimmery eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I again open my mouth to try and speak, but before I can even get a single word out, she lunges forward and wraps her arms around the back of my neck. Seconds later, she’s planting the deepest kiss she’s given me yet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My eyes widen in surprise and bliss as my girlfriend’s tongue penetrates deep into my mouth, wrapping itself around my member as it takes complete control over my orifice and explores every single nook. As Reeda kisses me deeper and deeper, I feel her hands work their way down from my neck to my back, at which point they pull me in closer, pressing our bodies so tightly together that It almost feels as if the raptor wants us to merge as one. To add emphasis to this desire, I feel a long and slender member wrap around my leg and up to my abdomen. I don’t need to look down to realize that my gee eff’s coiled her tail over my being, ensuring that even if I wanted to, there wouldn’t be any escape from her love-thirsty grip.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I close my eyes and give in to my girlfriend’s embrace, wrapping my arms around her back and sinking into her kiss, giving my everything to her and allowing my heart to take the reins rather than my brain...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don’t know how long we kiss each other, but by the time we both break away, Reeda and I are breathless and soaked in sweat. Yet rather than a smile on her lips, my girlfriend’s bearing a grimace, the tears from earlier flowing down her cheeks, smearing some of her mascara.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I put a hand on Reeda’s cheek and give her a warm smile. As I do, she places her hand on my own and caresses my limb. It brings a small smile of relief to her lips, but not enough to dispel all her sorrow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“A-Anon… I’m so… so sorry!” Reeda laments as she buries her face on my chest. “I was… so fuckin’ stupid!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I stay quiet. There’s nothing I can add right now that wouldn’t lead to opening some very fresh and excruciating wounds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda again looks me in the eye, only this time with a teary-eyed scowl. “I’m sorry… that I… that I…” She grits her teeth and looks down at the ground, all the while pressing her forehead under my chin. “I shouldn’t have invited you to practice!” my girlfriend finally shouts in a broken, shrill voice. “If I… If I’d only stuck to my guns and NOT done that shit… none of that bullshit with Trish would’ve happened!” She sobs, her tears leaving a big wet spot right where my heart is. “I… I know I was the one sayin’ we should pretend to be friends in school… but I thought… I ACTUALLY thought that Trish would be a sis and be all chill with you bein’ there to support us!” She balls her hands into fists, her body once more quaking with what I can only assume has to be anger. “But… but that... BITCH... showed me her true colors. She forced me to say some horrible crap to you… Forced me to think stuff that I didn’t want to think…” She turns her head to look up to me again with eyes overflowing with regret. “It took everything I had not to burst out in anger at the shit she was saying… or cry over the shit I was saying about you…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wrap Reeda in another embrace. “It’s okay. I know you didn’t mean any of the stuff you said back there,” I say, all the while caressing Reeda’s hair. “You did what you had to do to keep our secret. I don’t hold that against you.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda lets out a frustrated sigh as she gently backs out of my embrace. “That’s the thing, though,” she sneers, her hands once more curling into fists. “That shit Trish pulled… it don’t fucking fly with me!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I rub the back of my neck and let out a sigh of my own. “I mean, Trish was extra harsh towards me today, yeah… but it’s nothing THAT out of the ordinary for her.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No!” Reeda shouts, all the while the scowl on her face deepens. “She crossed a fucking line. Not only did she insult AND humiliate you, but after you left, she started grilling me about my weekend. Like, she got all into my biz, trying to pry every bit of information she could get out of me like she’s some fucking narc!” She shuts her eyes and sighs for the third time. “Worse, she got REAL curious about what kind of relationship you and I have going on…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My eyes widened again. I again keep my mouth shut, but from Reeda’s expression of anger, it’s obvious my reaction clues her into what I’m thinking about.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s eyes narrow. “What did she tell you right before she shut the door on your face?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“She said… some real nasty shit…” I answer as vaguely as I can. Reeda doesn’t need to hear the vitriol Trish spilled on me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon… tell me,” Reeda demands, her eyes further narrowing at my insistence to keep mum about things.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I… don’t think it’s important…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda grabs my shoulders and presses her forehead against mine. “Tell me, please!” she orders in a tone full of desperation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I sigh, close my eyes, and remember Trish’s words to the best of my shitty memory.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“She said… ‘I don’t know what the fuck you and Reeda have going on, but I’m warning your right now, you stay the fuck away from her, or I swear I’m going to make you regret ever transferring to our school’...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda takes a single step back, all the while placing a hand on her neck as if my words further added weight to that afternoon’s already heavy load.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After a few seconds, Reeda shakes her head, her face growing bright red from what I can only assume is anger. “How the fuck does Trish already suspects something between us when we’ve done nothing even to imply it?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I don’t know,” I answer truthfully. “But the way she’s acting, and the way she threatened me, it almost feels like…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Trish can sense shit!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Trish can sense shit!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda and I end up saying the words simultaneously, almost as if somehow synched with one another.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We look at each other for a few seconds, time which allows Reeda’s natural pink coloration to return to her. The anger starts to fade from her face as the corners of her lips begin perking. It’s clear she’s fighting to keep the anger in her, but she soon loses that battle when she brings a hand up to her snoot and lets out a hearty laugh. “Jinxed!” she remarks before giving me a light tap on the shoulder. “You owe me a drink!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I blink a few times as the message processes in my mind. The instant it does, I can’t help but let out a laugh. While not the exact way I would have preferred our conversation to end, I eagerly welcome the sudden shift in mood. To further ensure that the moment lasts for a bit longer, I close the distance between us and plant a soft kiss on her lips as a seal of acceptance to her demand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s cheeks turn flush again, thankfully not because of anger this time. She gives me a warm simper as she wipes the last of her tears from her eyes. She then grabs my right hand into hers and intertwines her fingers with mine, the smile on her lip not once faltering.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We’ll... we’ll figure something out about our mutual Trish problem. Right now, we have a beautifully warm evening to take advantage of, and the last thing I want is for you to think that I ruined it...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I nod and give my beautifully fluffy gee eff a smile of my own. “What’s on your mind, babe?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s cheeks grow even redder as she scratches her chin a bit playfully. “W-well, seein’ as this is technically our first date… I’m thinking we should live it up a bit!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My heart flutters when I hear Reeda use the word ‘date’ instead of ‘hangout.’ I shouldn’t be getting so excited about it, but something about hearing it spoken out loud fills me with a certain level of glee. ‘Maybe because it’s proof that I’ve started moving beyond my previously failed relationship? Maybe I’m the one who’s a hopeless romantic, but hearing the word makes it feel like we’re committing to each other, which I’m more than ready and willing to do.’</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda giggles, her blush growing so bright that it moved beyond her cheeks and up to the rest of her face. She doesn’t say a word, though. She doesn’t need to for me to know what she means...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So, where to?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda taps a finger on her chin. “I was thinking… Why don’t we go and relax by the beachside? It’s been a while since I’ve had a chance to enjoy some cool marine air. We can drop by this one shop on the way too. Pick up a few bottles of beer for us to enjoy.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I perk an eyebrow at Reeda’s suggestion. “I’m down for some beer, especially after today, but I doubt they’ll sell it to us considering we’re not twenty-one yet.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Where do you think I got the booze for our Friday hangout?” Reeda replies nonchalantly. “I know the guy who runs the liquor store. He’s cool about selling that shit to me.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wonder if her connection’s due to my girlfriend’s drug business, but I don’t press the matter further. I’m sure that with time, she'll open up more about it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For now, I think it’s best to enjoy the perks of Reeda’s business ventures into the world of narcotics and other mind-altering substances.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Lead the way then!” I say with a smile on my lips.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda cheers as she leads me down the road.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">***</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My girlfriend leans her head against my shoulder as we watch the sunset over the ocean’s horizon. She’s so mellow, so calm that I find it hard to believe that two hours earlier, Reeda was screaming and raging. The beer helped us calm down, but that particular memory is still vividly playing in my mind. It highlights the reality of our relationship. I won’t go so far as to call our love forbidden, but it's in a very tenuous position, especially if Trish has her way…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s already coiled tail wraps around my leg more as she lets out a weary sigh. From the tone, I can tell right away that she’s about to say something she’s been wanting to voice all afternoon but hadn’t quite had the courage to say.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon… do you think us being together… is a mistake?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The words take me back a bit, but my brain’s working in tandem with my heart this time as I plan and speak my reply less than a second after Reeda speaks her words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No,” I reply firmly and without a single doubt in my mind. “I think us being together is amazing and I don’t care what anyone has to say on the matter.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda smiles as she further buries her head on my shoulder. “You’re the best bee eff I’ve ever had…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I fight the urge to ask my girlfriend how many other guys she’s dated before. That’s a question she can answer if and when she feels comfortable answering it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Instead, I smile to myself and let out a small chuckle. “Damn. That’s kinda sad.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“And why’s that?” Reeda asks as she picks her head up, all the while giving me an amused, confused look.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I plant a kiss on her cheek, which makes Reeda’s cheek blush. “Because…” I hesitate for a second, well aware that my following words were the epitome of self-deprecation. “Because you’re so out of my league, I’m practically playing a whole different game… badly, I might add…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda shakes her head and punches me on the shoulder in reply. “Oh Anon, we gotta fix that self-esteem of yours!” my raptor gee eff’s cheeks again burn bright red as she looks deep into my eyes. “Lucky for you, we have the rest of our lives to—” she pauses for a second and lets out a short chuckle. “Not going to finish that sentence. It’s too fucking cheesy!” she exclaims before once more returning her head to rest on my shoulder. As she does, she lets out another sigh, one that almost sounds sorrowful…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We sit there in silence for a full minute before I build up enough courage to ask my next question.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What’s wrong?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s tail tightens around my leg, all the while her grip on my shoulder grows tighter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“...I’ve been thinking of quitting VVrum Drama…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The words shock me to my core. I cannot imagine a world where Reeda walks away from her love of music.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Quitting!?” I ask in a far more panicked tone than I should have. “B-but you love playing the drums for the band!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda doesn’t say anything, instead opting to hold on to me tighter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Is this… about Trish?” I ask, now starting to panic a bit because I may have inadvertently brought something terrible onto the timeline.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s not just Trish,” Reeda answers in a tone that makes her sound as if she's unsure of the words she’s speaking. “I have… personal shit coming up that’ll make keeping a consistent practice schedule… hard. Shit like work, and family business… and work…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You said work twice,” I say, not quite sure why I’d point out something so minor at a time like this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, that should tell you how important work’s going to be in the coming months for me.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Is this about that car you said you want to buy?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda tenses a bit at my words, but she waves it off with a weak giggle. “Yeah, the car!” She exclaims, all the while tightening her grip on my arm. “If I have a car, we won’t need to walk around everywhere we go. It’ll make things so much easier going forward… and shit...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not that her words aren’t valid, but something in the back of my mind tells me there’s more going on than what she’s telling me. Still, it’s probably not wise to prod too much into it right now, especially since our relationship's so early in its life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The last thing I want is another colossal fuck-up like what I did with Fang…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“How… how’d you think Trish will take the news?” I ask, wary of what my question entailed. “I mean... if she was giving you so much grief over vouching for me coming to practice, don’t you think she’s going to… well… flip the fuck out if you told her you’re quitting?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah…” Reeda replies as she wraps her hands around my left arm. “I have been thinking of how to best drop the news on her… but her attitude today kinda makes me wonder if it’s even a good idea. I mean, much as she’s a bitch about you, she’s still like family to me…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You can always… tell her the truth?” I say, hoping that my foolish advice was of at least some use. “Put it all out on the table. Let her know that you have shit coming up and need some time to take care of it. Besides, school’s ending in like three months anyway, I doubt there’ll be time for bands once real-life hits hard.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My own words sober me up to the fact that if I didn’t get my shit together before the school year ends, I’d probably wind up having to join the marines or some shit like that if I don't want to wind up homeless…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“W-what if Trish… doesn’t take the news well?” Reeda asks with a tinge of fear in her voice. “The last thing I want is to ruin our friendship before…” She lets out a sigh and only holds on to me tighter. “You know what? Let's forget about this shit. I’ll sort it out later. Somehow….” She again looks into my eyes and gives me a soft, delicate smile. “Right now, it’s about us and getting some much-needed decompression. Besides...” She flips herself right onto my lap, her hands grabbing onto my face as she presses her forehead against mine for the second time that day. “...I owe ya for taking that beating from Trish…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I smile and wrap my hands around my girlfriend’s abdomen, bringing her in closer to me. “For you, I’d take a physical beating,” I say, closing the distance to Reeda’s lips.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda lets out another giggle. “You’ve already gotten the shit kicked out of you. Remember the carfe dealer?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh yeah,” I say, the grin on my lips only widening. “Well, if that’s the case, then I’m willing to go to the ends of the earth for you!” I add, only realizing a second after I said those words just how cheesy they sounded. ‘Couldn’t make it sound more like a romantic cliche if I wanted to,’ I end up thinking with a bit of shame.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda bursts into laughter before she nuzzles my cheek with her soft cheek. “Oh, Anon… I don’t deserve you…” Reeda coos into my ear as she pulls back enough to plant a kiss on my lips, her tongue once again moving in to conquer all territory in my mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As the last rays of sunlight fade away on the oceanside horizon, a fire starts to rage between Reeda and myself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’d compare us to a beacon of light in the darkness, but that’d be super corny, so I won’t…</div>
