Tomorrow's not looking good either</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The school comes into view, as well as his rival</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon gives the bollard a hefty smack as he passes it. The pain coursing through his palm a reminder that he's not yet strong enough</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He saw what Principal Spears did that day. That flag pole didn't stand a chance</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Neither did the students that put the underwear up there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Motion in the corner of his eye drops him from his clouds of thought</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now there's a sight for sore eyes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The Goth-Ptero-GF known as Fang runs up to meet Anon at the top of the stairs</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Texting is no replacement for the delightful sensation Anon's tightening heart experiences as he walks with Fang in person</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Smalltalk chirps out between the two of them, filling in the gaps of their weekend that were too small to text</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The school's entrance comes into view. Now there's an opportunity. Those doors aren't wide enough are they?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>An arm reaches across Fang's shoulders, pulling her into Anon in a side-hug as they pass the threshold into the school</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang quietly squawks out a note of embarrassment, before playfully pushing Anon away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Gotta maintain that punk outcast appearance eh?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Red blush marking her face does a poor job of hiding her feelings however</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The moment was soured as a certain dinosaur rounded the corner, walking a straight line to them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Raptor Jesus what does the tangerine terror want now? And what's that in her hand?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi reaches her destination in front of the pair, offering out plastic platitudes in greeting</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Where's Naser to pull her away when Anon needs him? She's going to make them miss their first classes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's thoughts are interrupted as Naomi finally ends her spiel and thrusts a small box wrapped with a ribbon towards him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wait what? Right in front of Fang?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What scheme is she trying to pull off now?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon swears he can hear the bones in Fang's hand grind together in anticipation of a second round</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi must have heard it too, as she abruptly finds a reply to go with the box</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Happy birthday Anon!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What!? Wait... uh. Oh. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The box is gingerly taken from Naomi's hands</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Raptor Jesus, it's already been a year since the last one?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon can't even remember what happened last year</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Is this what getting old feels like?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang is stunned to silence beside Anon, her face communicating her message before her voice can</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It's your birthday!? Why didn't you tell me?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon scrambles for the proper words. The truth of it sounding out like a half-baked lie</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I mean really, who forgets their birthday? I guess only weirdos like himself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon tries to distract Fang away from his excuse by revealing what the box contains</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Attached to the ribbon, a small pre-made tag reads 'Happy Birthday'. Naomi must have expected him to see that first</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The ribbon is torn away, and the box unfolded to reveal a cupcake</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That's... actually kinda nice. Breakfast never seemed to last very long after his trek to school</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon gives Naomi a small word of gratitude as he takes a bite out of it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not his favourite flavour, but there's enough sugar and frosting on it to give him adolescent diabetes and that's good enough for him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A bittersweet feeling seeps into Anon's heart. Even if it is a scheme, Naomi did go out of her way to remember his birthday and get him a gift</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The expression adorning his face tells Naomi all she needs to know</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her mission accomplished, she excuses herself, walking away from the pair</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon can't quite figure her out. Maybe she's still sore about prom and is trying to one-up Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Speaking of, Fang still looks pissed. Shit. Think fast don't fuck this up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon offers her what remains of his cupcake</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her gaze sweeps between Anon and the treat until she accepts it with an amused huff.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That cupcake never stood a chance. One blur of motion later and it's all gone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang's face twists around until it finally settles with a satiated smile, heavy eyelids drooping down for a moment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A quick turn of the box reveals the flavour of the cupcake. Something that makes Fang react like that is well worth knowing</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One mental note to save it into his phone later, Anon looks around to find a garbage can</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And it's all the way over there.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fuck it. No way is he going to walk that far</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His arm snaps back with its payload and launches it forward towards the bin</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It sails in a clean arc through the air and-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh fuck it's too high</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Just as Anon resigns himself for another walk of shame, a pink shape whips around the corner and offers its body as a backboard</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Swoosh, nothing but can</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed just stands there with a look of surprise on his face as the bin hungrily accepts the cardboard offering</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It only takes a moment for Reed to connect the dots, his vision sweeping to where Anon and Fang stand</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A wink and some finger guns later, he's gone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That guy's timing is impeccable I swear</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Just before Fang can continue interrogating Anon, the klaxon of the school's early-warning bell rings out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Relief washes over Anon's face. He is in no way ready to deal with the questions coming from Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But she reminds Anon that he's not out of the woods yet, and that she expects a proper answer during lunch</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Shit</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With a cheeky tongue poking out and wink later, Fang heads off to her first class</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon is left in the hallway with a smoldering red face of his own</div><div class="fanfic-line">>God damn. What that ptero does to him</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fuck English, fuck math</div><div class="fanfic-line">>More useless poetry crap that Anon can't see being useful ever</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I mean fuck, it says the drapes were grey! It means they're grey! If they were sad then the author should have said so! Fuck</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And then Mr. Carlesiidewski piles on an unbelievable amount of math homework</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Couldn't even get Reed's help this time. He was too preoccupied discussing something with Trish</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was clearly a private conversation, and Anon's not one to interrupt his homie like that</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed grabs onto Anon's shoulder with a consolatory hand as they walk to the cafeteria, listening to him gripe</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon is almost too preoccupied with voicing out his misfortunes as Reed pulls him along</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wait, what's going on here? This isn't the way to the cafeteria</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Reed, this is the wrong way."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Nah man. Gotta grab something from the auditorium first before we grab our grub. Alright? We're taking a scenic route."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yeah sure. Hopefully Fang is out grabbing her own food. Wouldn't want to look like he was flaking out on her by leaving with Reed</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A short jaunt later, the auditorium stands before them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed pushes through the door first, quipping that he'll get the lights, and that the item in question is by the stage</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The stark darkness of the room alleviates Anon's fear of encountering Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It doesn't, however, alleviate his fear of tripping and having another bollard incident.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The light leaking from the door only reaches so far. Anon has to trust his feet just like-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Damnit Stella stop projecting those invasive thoughts about shounen anime</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed said to grab something by the stage while he gets the lights. What's taking him so long?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Gotta get this and go before the lunch line becomes insurmountable</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Would Reed really sacrifice a second helping of food for this? Surely not</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Can't even see what to grab. Batdino is nowhere to assist in this darkness</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And then all Anon can see is blinding white</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hands shoot up to massage his impaired eyes as a hiss of pain escapes him, "Could have used some warning Reed."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Sorry bro." Reed pauses a moment, "It's right in front of you"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>How the raptor manages to have permanently dilated pupils yet still recover that fast Anon will never know</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The pain and white afterimage eventually fades, leaving Anon directly in front of a decorated cake</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Flowing icing announces the occasion: "Happy Birthday Anon!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"SURPRISE!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon whirls around, his vision quickly settling on two dinosaurs sitting right behind him in the front row, both looking incredibly smug</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang and Trish sit side-by-side, the pair doing a poor job of hiding their amusement</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even Reed is displaying the face of a man whose perfect plan came to fruition</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But, how did they get a cake on such short notice?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Munchies for munchies my man." Reed replies, the glassware in his backpack signaling its presence as he finally joins everyone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Cafeteria staff will make anything you want, provided they have an incentive."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That's... good to know. Not that Anon believes he would ever have anything to incentivize them with</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang pushes up off her seat, walking towards Anon before encircling her arms and wings around him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And then the singing begins</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If there is a better way to have someone sing Happy Birthday, Anon cannot fathom it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even Reed and Trish join in as Fang rocks him back and forth to its tempo</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's heart thrums against his ribcage with its own sympathetic voice, he himself being left speechless</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He knows Fang can hear it, can feel it, can understand the unbounded love pulsing within</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She certainly knew it couldn't be quietened by a hug alone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As the song reaches its crescendo, they pull apart slightly, giving just enough space to bring their lips together</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A spark crosses between them on contact, signaling the coming end of their embrace, yet promising a future encore</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They part with a smile, Fang moving over towards the cake</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Come on Anon, let's get some cake before Reed eats it all."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon turns around and</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She wasn't kidding. Reed's dishing himself out an entire quarter of the cake onto a plate</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His lunch replacement in hand, Anon sits down to enjoy another gamble with diabetic shock</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Or at least he would if Reed wasn't unsubtly hinting at something</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No seriously, what is this? Interpretive dance? Dino sign language?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now Anon wonders if he was shitposting at some critical moment in Mr. Tsuki's class</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Shit, will this be on the final exam?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Without warning, Trish grabs the back of Reed's head and dunks it straight into the pile of cake on his plate</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even months of being with these dinos doesn't prepare Anon for pranks of this caliber</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed emerges from his cake mountain, a content smile on his face as he chews away at what his mouth scooped up during the descent</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon swears he heard Reed say "Now it's a party", but with that much food in his mouth it's hard to say</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That makes Anon wonder, does this mean he's next in line if he joins one of their birthday celebrations?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Eh. Probably worth it. Not like his cue-ball-head is that hard to clean anyway</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The dwindling slab of dessert marks the passing time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon is about ready to throw in the towel when Fang finally presents him with the question he's been dreading all day</div><div class="fanfic-line">>How could Anon forget his own birthday?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Where does he even start? With how every birthday had a completely different set of kids join in?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon swears the gifts could have been found at a gas station, the parents using the occasion as cheap day-care for their kids</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It dwindled down from there. Eventually, it was just him and his parents.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The two of them didn't care much for it either</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Just another day with their spawn</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon hasn't even received a text message today never mind a phone call</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe they'll remember they forgot when tomorrow rolls around</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Probably not if last year is anything to go by</div><div class="fanfic-line">>By the end of his tale, Fang looks like she regrets asking</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even Trish looks to be contemplating how she's treated Anon over the past few months</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed is, well... he did stop eating his cake. That's gotta count for something</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The trio glance back and forth at each-other before coming to a silent agreement</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang pulls Anon out of his chair before her arms squeeze into him as if he might turn to dust and blow away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She isn't alone either, Trish and Reed join in the embrace seconds later providing their own strength and support for Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...It's been a really long time since Anon has felt like this</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even he can't play the stoic now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Shuddering breaths. In and out, in and out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All those lonely years, all that regret, just let it go</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon is the one to signal the end of the embrace, his emotional roller coaster arriving at the station at last</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed and Trish are the first to peel away, with Fang taking a moment longer before she too decouples from him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon wipes the tears out of his eyes. His friends may understand the watery trails lining his face, but the rest of the student body is a bit more primal</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The next classes are soon. Would be best to get everything cleaned up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed announces that he'll deal with what remains of the cake.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon heaves a laugh. Guess Reed's getting his second round after all</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Their farewells said, Fang and Anon split off to their next class, hand in hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's not sure which of the deities granted his wish, but Dr. Fernsworth isn't in class today</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Something bad on the news Anon guesses. He did skim across a story about a toxic waste transport tipping over today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In his place is some substitute teacher who just can't be bothered</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang is definitely taking advantage of the situation. Her fingers are a blur across her phone screen as she shuffles through multiple conversations</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Meanwhile, Anon is attempting to put a dent in his math homework</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe he can bump up his grades if he stops mooching off Reed all the time. A bit of a long shot sure, but the military is looking less and less appealing by the day</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang's whirlwind of fingers pauses a moment to query Anon's plans for today</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Rock Ring, Saturnia, shitposting and...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Pffff no. He's not doing anything if she's the one asking</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her eyes glint in the light before she returns to her phone, the tornado of texting returning to wreak havoc on her phone screen</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon heavily considers getting some typing tips from Fang. At the speeds she's going, she could conquer entire websites</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Then again, he can't explain to her why he wants texting lessons. The secret must remain contained</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Last class of the day, freedom close enough to taste</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Doesn't mean that Anon is home free however.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Who is Coda and why do people keep going back to him? Sometimes he's Fine, sometimes he's in D.C.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang's already completed her worksheet, and is softly plucking away at the strings of the hall pass</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Every now and then she'll glance at Anon's worksheet and prod him towards the correct answer</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All but the last one anyway. Seriously what did the Italians do to have everything in music named by them?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang isn't divulging any answers for this one</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's pleading look must have done something however, as Fang finally responds</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I'll help you on one condition."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well, it couldn't be that bad could it? It is his birthday</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon agrees without even bothering to ask what the condition is</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A predatory grin forms on Fang's face, her prey cornered</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her unstructured practice halts, replaced with hushed chords</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The chords pick at Anon's memory. They're familiar, yet ethereal, tracing the edges of his thoughts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Then, a lightning strike of realization courses through Anon, his eyes widening. Fang takes that as her cue</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Without a sound, Fang encores the words sung in the auditorium</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A secret to everyone else in class. They're either too focused on their own classwork or are taking a page out of Mr. Jingo's book and have headphones on</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Still didn't prevent Anon's heart from skipping a beat nor did it prevent the rush of red tint from spilling onto his face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This was certainly a new tier of prank Anon hadn't even considered. A knife's edge away from complete and utter embarrassment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon needs a minute to recover from that while Fang busies herself fixing up his worksheet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The orchestration of school bells signals the finality of the school day</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed and Trish are both there to greet the duo at the exit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish passes a bag to Fang, who upon inspecting the contents, hands it over to Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What are these? Movies?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon scans over the titles. Planet of the Grugs, Triassic Park, Despot Kong, The Last Unicorn, Unga-Bunga of the Jungle, to name a few</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Et tu, Trigge?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Apparently the school library has a selection of old movies archived away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Quite the coincidence that Trish chose these in particular. Did she get some advice from Naser?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish's poker face is marred by the mirth dancing in her eyes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He'd have to get even later. Fang is already guiding everyone to the main event of the day</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's party to be hosted at her house, complete with even more cake and movies</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Diabetes is looking better and better every day</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If Fang's Dad decides he's had enough of Anon, the refined sugar coursing through his veins should give him an edge in running away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The human's and ptero's hands find each other, fingers interlocking, as Anon gives his answer</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah, that sounds great."</div>
