I'll show him. I don't need his stupid monkey cock. What I need now is strong dino dick. Fellow Dinos are more faithful than those stupid barbaric fire starters, and probably more hung too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I reach for my phone, claws making clicking noises against its screen as I furiously text my best friend Trish. She's resourceful, she can cook me up. My fucking shitty knuckle dragger "boyfriend" is going to be so jealous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A couple of hour laters, after my dumb retarded family finally leaves, there's a knock on my door. I practically rip the door off its hinges as I open it, inviting three extremely handsome triceratops inside. Wasting little time, I rip off my pants, exposing my gender neutral slit to them as I bend myself over my awful dad's chair.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The strapping, handsome, and better than human dinos waste little time either, removing their own clothing as well. One straddles me from the back, while the other two motion for me to jerk off their dicks, which I gladly do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">While giving the two giant slabs of dino-dick the respect they deserve, the one grinding me from behind finally penetrates my enbie hole, causing me to scream out a moan as my tongue hangs out of my mouth. My insides are perfectly filled with triceratops penis, which my STUPID UNFAITHFUL SKINNIE BOYFRIEND could never hope to achieve.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We all basically cum at the same time being equals, and I bask in the afterglow. There's another knock on the door, and I don't even bother cleaning myself up or putting pants on to answer it. My parents will see just how strong and independent I am.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm surprised however, to see that it's my bestie, leading my NO GOOD BOYFRIEND behind on a leash--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Heeey. You've been pounding away at your laptop for a while now. You know lunch is almost over, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed's voice calls out to me, and I slam my laptop closed in a panic. He raises a questioning brow at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Whatcha doing anyway? I don't remember any assignments from class."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Shit. He can't know. Quickly Trish, think of something. You're smart and cool, you can do it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh...Venue stuff." Nailed it. I mentally fist pump at my flawless lie, and Reed just shrugs and returns to drinking from his thermos.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thank god. They can never know. No one can ever know.</div>
