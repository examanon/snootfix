Him and Naser decided to do a bro's night.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The only other person that was home with them at the time was Samantha, nice lady, but could be strict when she needed to be.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>thankfully she seemed to be nice about tonight, must've seen tonight as Naser getting an "off" day from being the perfect boy everyone sees him as.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You boys tell me if you need something, okay? Have fun~!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon looked back at Naser, a bit of a flabbergasted grin on his face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You know, for a boy's night, it feels more like we're twelve years old having a sleepover."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naser smiled and "pshhh'd" at Anon's teasing statement. He was ready to make him eat his words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yea, until I decide to kick your ass at some Claws of Duty, man."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon rolls his eyes competitively. "You're on, clown-ass."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The next few hours is spent with Naser and Anon dicking around and playing vidya.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The night gets going and soon enough it's already almost midnight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon looks over, barely able to keep his eyes open, but he noticed Naser had just been getting more and more energetic through the night.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At this moment Naser was rambling about some meta tactic in Claws of Duty: Advanced Cave-Wars.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"ALRIGHT, S-SO LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE EXO-SUITS LET YOU JUMP HIGH AND SHIT? WELL, WHATYOUGOTTADOIS-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Holy fuck, Anon could barely understand the shit he was saying...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naser got killed by some random enemy, and his scream of rage broke Anon out of his sleepy stupor immediately.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"GOD FUCKING DAMMIT YOU RETARDED PIECE OF SHIT TRIGGER MOTHERFUCKER!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh God, did Samantha hear that? Did the people in the game hear that? Meh, if the dudes in the game did he didn't care, but Samantha was a different story...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Dude, Naser, you alright man?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naser looks over as if his seething rage never happened and gave Anon a toothy smile.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hell yea, man! Never better my skinna! My fucking amigo!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon was feeling a little weirded out right about now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Uhhh, Naser. You've been acting funny." Anon rolls his eyes, sarcasm then dripping from his words. "You forget to take your meds or something?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naser looks at him, a dead glare all he has.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I did... Didn't I?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Panic sets in Naser as he goes fucking nuts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"OH GOD MY MOM'S GOING TO FUCKING SKIN ME ALIVE I KNOW IT!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naser sprints to his room's bathroom and shuffling is heard from where anon is seated.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Panicked rambling is heard while a pill bottle is heard jostling around its contents.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Water is heard turning on, and then silence.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After what felt like almost an hour, Naser finally comes back into the room and looks like he did before he went batshit insane.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Sorry 'bout that, Anon. I got these emotional imbalances and I gotta take meds for it. Sorry for not telling you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon just sits there, unsure of how to take this info.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His face says it all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"What the fuck even just happened right now..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon shrugs it off and the rest of the night is spent in relative peace.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Guess even someone like Naser needs some kind of "good boy" pills to not go fucking crazy.</div>
