                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Fang/Anon Bodyswap Alternate</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang, Naser</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: NSFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: SurpriseVisitor</div><div class="fanfic-line">Summary: Anon wakes up in Fang's body and Fang wakes up in Anon's. Fang takes the opportunity to bring the two of them closer together than any other couple on earth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I scrunch my face and stretch my limbs as the final afterthoughts of some bizarre dream involving sprouting wings and flying fade into the background of my mind. A breathy groan escapes me as I blink the sleep from my eyes, sitting up straight in my bed. I stretch again, raising my arms high into the air, and a familiar ‘vhwoomp’ of feathery wings unfurling sounds from behind me. I look over to my beautiful pterodactyl girlfriend laying beside me, and I do not see my beautiful pterodactyl girlfriend laying beside me. I see a bald human laying beside me. A dashingly handsome bald human, but a bald human my pterodactyl girlfriend is not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Where is my pterodactyl girlfriend? A panicked scream threatens to emerge from me, but I force it down with some effort. This is just another one of Fang’s pranks. Screaming means I lose. I chuckle to myself, having narrowly avoided an embarrassing defeat. I start to reach over to the human costume, but hesitate. What if it’s just a mannequin? I can’t counter-prank a mannequin, I’d look like an idiot for trying. I look closer, and see the rising and falling of its sides. We’re in the clear, counter-prank is a go.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I reach over towards Fang in a human costume, my pale blue arm and black claws hovering inches from them. Why was my arm pale blue? Why did I have black claws? I pull my hand back and thoroughly inspect it, flexing the fingers and poking the tips of the claws. It’s definitely my hand, but it’s not a hand I remember having. I glance at the pair of angelic wings on full display behind me. I brush the hand through its feathers, feeling the fingers trace through it’s folds. My fingers. On my wings. The wings lightly flap once, the previously unknown joints and muscles feeling distressingly normal. I look down at my black top and...oh my fucking God.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I tear myself out from under the covers and rush into the bathroom and to the mirror. A panic-stricken Fang looks back at me from inside the mirror. I raise a hand to my face and the Fang inside the mirror does the same. I run my hand across my gargantuan snout and the Fang inside the mirror does the same. I press my hand against the mirror and the Fang inside the mirror does the same. There is no Fang inside the mirror. Just me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The urge to scream fills me a second time, but I force it down again. There’s no need to panic, this is just a dream. A weird, incredibly lucid dream. A weird, incredibly lucid dream where I can physically control limbs and feel body parts that I’ve never had before and would have no possible frame of reference for. Just a dream. I look down again at my black top and…oh my fucking God.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon!” A scared, confused and distinctly masculine voice calls from the other room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah?” A scared, confused and distinctly feminine voice responds from my mouth. Feet hit the floor and rush over to the bathroom door, that dashingly handsome human from before throwing the door open. It’s like I’m looking into a mirror, but that can't be the case because the mirror is on the wall to my right, not panting in the middle of the bathroom in front of me. He slides over next to me, gripping the sinktop and staring into the mirror along with me. We stare together, at each other but not at each other because we were each other and not ourselves. I think.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m dreaming, right?” I ask.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No. I’m dreaming,” I respond. No, wait, that’s my voice, but not my words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What? No. How can you be dreaming if I’m dreaming?” I rebut. We looked at each other like the other one of us was an idiot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fine then, pinch me,” I- he demands.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What? No, you pinch me,” I counter. We stare at each other, unmoving and unwilling.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What if we’re both dreaming?” I ask.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“That doesn’t make any sense.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Does any of this make any sense?” I wildly gesture to myself. He grumbles in response. We return to inspecting ourselves in the mirror, hands brushing across our new features. Snout, crest, tail, weird elbow feathers, and...oh my fucking God.</div><div class="fanfic-line">…</div><div class="fanfic-line">I have boobs. And not disgusting man titties either; actual, female breasts. Modest breasts, but breasts nonetheless. I bring a hand to my chest, but Fang- no, Anon- no...Fang-Anon...catches it with his own. He moves behind me, entangling our fingers and wrapping our arms around my waist, pressing his chin on my shoulder and his cheek against mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey,” he says, simply and coolly. The embrace goes a long way towards calming me down, and I let out a long breath.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey,” I respond. He starts lightly rocking me side to side, rubbing my thumbs with his. I close my eyes and sigh. It’s weird, but we’re still us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’ve got a pretty good idea.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hmm?” His hands drag mine across my feathery exterior towards my midriff.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Way I see it, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, right?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I guess…” He shifts his head further into mine, making me blush a little more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We have a chance to become closer than any other couple on Earth,” he whispers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Wha-” My blush explodes across my face. Before I can protest, the phone in my pocket buzzes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh fuck,” Fang says quietly. With my voice. “That’s gotta be Naser. He’s gonna want me back today. He’s gonna want you back today.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh, well that..oh...fuck.” The realization dawns on me far later than it should have. The blush drains from me as I pull the phone out and turn the screen on, blankly staring at the password screen for a moment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Four ones,” Fang comments. I input the password I definitely didn’t know before just now and a notification pops up on the screen. Naser did in fact want Fang back later today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Uh, what are you gonna tell him?” I ask tentatively.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What am I gonna tell him? What are you gonna tell him? You’re Fang.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Whoa whoa whoa, no, no no no, I did not sign up for this shit. He’s still your brother. You are not sending me back with your brother, to your house, with your parents. That is a disaster waiting to happen.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What’s the worst that could happen?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I wake up in your bed as me, your dad turns my skull into an impromptu golf ball, and the rest of me is buried in six different counties.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Alright, alright, whatever. We gotta come up with something, cause I don’t think Naser or dad are gonna take ‘no’ for an answer this time around.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well...what would you normally do in this situation?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Tell Naser to fuck off, and hope he does.” Fuck it, guess I’ll give it a shot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I open the messenger app, navigate to Naser’s entry and begin typing out a message.</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘Any chance we could move that to tomorrow? Some stuff has kinda come up.’ Almost immediately, a symbol indicating Naser’s incoming response appears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘What kind of stuff?’</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘Important stuff.’ A few seconds pass without an indication of a message being prepared, then the phone starts buzzing wildly. Naser was not content with text and is calling me directly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s all you now, Anon. Fang. You.” Fang-Anon’s voice did not calm me one bit. I swipe the answer icon, and put the phone to my ear-hole...thing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang? Is everything alright?” Naser’s concern for both himself and me were obvious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yup! All good here!” I hope my anxiety wasn’t obvious in my voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Are you sure?” Naser’s voice lowers and he whispers through the phone. “Do you need me to call the cops?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What? No, no. I promise, it’s alright.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Then what’s so important?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I...well...you see…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You know dad’s not going to take any old excuse, right?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah, I know, it’s just...uh…you know, I don’t think you’d believe me if I told you.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang, that’s not...wait. Please don’t tell me you’re pregnant.” My eyes bug out at the idea that Naser even thought this was a possibility. Actually…</div><div class="fanfic-line">I glance over to Fang-Anon, and he’s wildly shaking his head, doing a cut-throat motion, and mouthing ‘no’ over and over again. Okay, bad idea, got it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No, holy shit, Fa...I am not fucking pregnant, Naser.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Are you sure?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“YES!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Alright, alright, but what the hell am I going to tell dad?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Man, I don’t know...like...fucking...I think you need to see this for yourself.” Fang-Anon bites back a scream, not happy with that conclusion.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I...okay.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Just promise me that you’ll...keep an open mind, I guess?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What is that supposed- nevermind, I’ll find out when I get there. See you in a bit. Bye.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Bye.” The phone clicks, and the call ends.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You fucking idiot,” Fang-Anon hisses.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“The fuck did you want me to do? Telling him to fuck off didn’t work.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Not bring him here!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You told me it was on me. You don’t get to bitch about the outcome.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“How the fuck are we going to possibly explain to him that we’ve...fucking swapped bodies? I barely even believe it myself, and I’m sitting here in your fucking body!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I sit in my desk chair as Fang-Anon rapidly paces back and forth across the apartment. Volcadera Bluff was not a particularly massive town. It would not take Naser a very long time to get here. Time that I was wasting by thinking about the time I have left, rather than trying to figure out some sort of plan. Time that I was wasting thinking about wasting the time I have left thinking about the time I have left, rather than…</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon, shut the fuck up. Please.” Sorry. Guess I still mumble even as Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We just need to...we just...need to…” His train of thought is interrupted by a knock on the door. “Fuck.” He glances over to me. I guess the pleasure is all mine. I walk over to the door and open it, Fang-Anon leaning against a countertop a bit further away. Naser stands in the doorway, looking at me expectantly. My mind completely blanks on what I was planning on saying. Had I even figured out something to say in the first place?</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well? What’s so important that I had to come out here to hear it in person?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I...uh...mm…” I struggle to make a coherent noise for a moment, and then Fang-Anon speaks up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon and I swapped bodies. It’s as stupid as it sounds.” Naser looks back to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Alright, now what’s the real reason?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang and I swapped bodies. It’s...as stupid as it sounds.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Did you really call me out here for some stupid prank, Fang?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“...” Oh shit, he’s talking to me. “Wait, no. Please, Naser. I’m serious. It’s the truth.” I do my best to sound as sincere as possible. It wasn’t difficult considering I’m telling the truth after all, but I hope the extra effort I put into it helps. Naser looks confused, but unimpressed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Alright. Prove it.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I...uh…” Think, Anon, think. What’s something that Anon and Naser know that Fang wouldn’t know?  Something so minor and inconsequential that I would never even bother telling her, if I had even remembered it in the first place? Come on…</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Remember....remember…remember...the first day of school! At lunch! I had one of those shitty school pizzas, and while we were talking it became inedible, and Naomi got you to split that sandwich with me. A philly cheesesteak. Holy fuck, it was good too. Remember?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I...yeah. I do remember that, actually. But...well…” Fang-Anon clears his throat, and we turn to look at him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Stephen Ha-wing, Helen Fly-er, Peter Wing-lage…” He rattles off a half-dozen other disabled celebrity wing-puns without skipping a beat. “Need I go on?” he concludes, smirking. Naser looks on in awe as what used to be my mouth says things only Fang had ever dared to say. He looks back between Fang-Anon and I multiple times, his eyes and mouth wider with every go-between.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What the fuck…” he says, to nobody in particular. “So, you’re Anon?” he asks, looking at me. I nod. “And you’re Fang?” he asks Fang-Anon, who also nods. “Holy shit.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Do you believe us now?” I ask pleadingly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I...what choice do I have? Only Fang would be able to say any of that so easily and so swiftly. How long is this going to go on?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I dunno. Might be tomorrow. Might be next week. Might be never. Hopefully not never, there are definitely certain parts of me that I like and will be sorely missing very soon.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hah! He misses his dick already,” Fang-Anon teases.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You shut your mouth, you can’t possibly understand what I’m going through.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Okay, okay,” Naser interrupts. “I’m gonna go, you two...nevermind I’m not even gonna think about that one. I’ll figure something out. Let me know if you’re better by tomorrow, I guess.” Naser turns around and heads towards the stairwell and out of sight. I close the door, relieved.</div><div class="fanfic-line">We return to the main room and before I can even start mulling over what to do next, Fang-Anon wraps his arms around me again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So I guess we have carte blanche to do whatever we want now, huh?” He wonders aloud. My blush returns in full force.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang, I dunno...this is kinda weird.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Come on, think about it. This is a chance to truly understand each other’s bodies like nobody else possibly could.” If I had any doubts on what he was implying before, they were gone now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“This is really weird, Fang…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m still your girlfriend, aren’t I?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Uh…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You aren’t so insecure about your sexuality that you’ll say no to your own girlfriend, aren’t you?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I think offering to fuck me with my own dick is a little farther than most people have to deal with.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey, you said it, not me.” Fuck. “Besides…” He leans in, chin on my shoulder again, and whispers in my ear, hole...thing. “I know all my favorite spots.” I blush so hard I begin to sweat. He chuckles, and I don’t notice his hand slowly sliding up my torso until it’s right below one of my new boobs. He plants his lips on my neck and a hand on my breast, squeezing ever so gently. I gasp from the small but unexpected jolt of pleasure.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang, I really don’t know if I’m comfortable with where this might go…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’ll keep that in mind when I hear you beg for it later.”  Sweet Raptor Jesus I am so fucking fucked. “Hey, you said it, not me.” I’m still mumbling too, wonderful. He releases me and seats himself on the bed, looks at me seductively, then waggles his eyebrows while patting an open spot next to him. I take a moment to really soak in the complete insanity that I’m looking at. I look down at the all black, low-cut and partially ripped shirt and pants adorning my body, the pale blue feathers covering the rest of me. This is who I am, for today at least. I look back up at myself, but it’s not myself because it’s actually my girlfriend, who’s also my boyfriend, I think. This is who she is, for today at least. A couple of horny teenagers in the same room, thinking the same thing - albeit for different reasons - given one of the wildest and most fantastic opportunities imaginable. I take a deep breath and mentally steel myself. This was no time to back down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take my place next to Fang-Anon and he scooches next to me, pulling me close. I wrap my arms around him just like I would do if things were normal. I’m a bit smaller than normal, but I’ll ignore that. I lean into his shoulder and he leans back against me. My nervous heart and fluttering stomach is a confusing bundle of emotions that I can’t seem to still.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why do you seem so comfortable with this?” I ask. “I’m kinda freaking out over here and you’re just...cool with it.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hmm...you ever wonder what it would be like to be a girl? Like, before today, obviously?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Honestly, not really. I kinda liked all my features where they were.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ah, well. Maybe it’s because I’m a dino, most of the time anyway. Having to deal with estrus season every year gets...tiring. Spent a lot of time wondering if the grass was really greener on the other side; how nice it would supposedly be to spend some time relaxing during that time of the year for a change, rather than being a horny, hormonal mess. Trust me, being a reject like me during estrus season sucks all of the dicks. Not wanting to get into specifics, but it tends to amplify...everything. For better and for worse.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Damn, that actually makes a lot of sense. My train of thought is interrupted by lips pressing against mine. The sensation is thankfully very familiar, considering the amount of kissing we’ve done before on this very bed. My heart swells and the fluttering intensifies, but they are now united in purpose.</div><div class="fanfic-line">*VHOOMF*</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel my wings quickly and roughly splay themselves open to their fullest extent, startling me off of the kiss. Fang-Anon opens his eyes and immediately bursts into laughter. I try to control the limbs with what little active knowledge I had of them, but get nothing in response. I reach over to forcefully push them around, but they resist my every attempted movement.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I...Fang! Help! Wings! Stop laughing!” He does not stop laughing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I can’t...I can’t…” He gasps for air as he doubles over, unable to finish a sentence. I do my best to look angry but just end up crossing my arms and pouting.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I can’t help you...they’re stuck like that for a while...hehehe…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why? How come I’ve never seen this before?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Winged dinos learn to suppress that reflex early on cause it’s embarrassing. Guess it didn’t work for you, so you’re stuck with a wingboner for...all day, probably.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It lasts a whole fucking day?!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No, but I’m not going to give you enough time to calm it down.” Before I can respond, he grabs me and pulls me into another kiss. I feel his tongue flick across my lips, and I gingerly tilt my head and open my mouth. I have a general idea of what to do, but to actually emulate it with this weird reptilian tongue is another matter entirely. Fang-Anon’s tongue wastes no time barging into my mouth while I’m busy trying to figure out how to use my own. Mine tentatively meets his, and an awkward dance of quasi-virgin tongue-kissing commences. It doesn’t take me long to figure out that my tongue is long and dextrous enough that it can actually wrap around his completely. The sensation is certainly interesting from my end, and when he yanks me closer, hot breath washing over my snout as he hungrily searches for more, it confirms that he very much likes it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang-Anon breaks away and we stare into each other’s eyes, panting heavily as a thin, transparent string of saliva connects us for a moment longer before falling and breaking. For the first time today, I notice a consistent and repetitive ‘whap’ right behind me. I struggle to tear myself away from Fang-Anon’s eyes to take a peek behind me, and see my tail going completely haywire against the mattress. Did dinos usually have this little control over their own body? Wings splayed taut, tail frantically beating, heart racing, breath heavy, knees weak, arms heavy, and it apparently gets worse when they get into season?</div><div class="fanfic-line">An arm grabs mine and pulls me over, and I fall on top of Anon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hush, dweeb,” he whispers. I take the advice, wrapping my arms around his neck and pressing my head into his chest, listening to his heartbeat. “Let me show you something.” Fingers start tracing circles in the bare feathers on my lower back, just above my waist. I relax even further, our legs entangling and my waist resting against his. The fingers crawl up my back and past my shirt, and stop around where my wings are connected. Two pairs of fingers rest on a bit of muscle in between the wing connections and my shoulders, and another two pairs rest just underneath the connections. This is nice and all, but he’s not really doing...anything…</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So, uh, is this-” As if he was waiting for me to speak up, the fingers gently press into me. All at once almost every muscle in my body tenses, then goes limp and I melt into Anon’s embrace. Even my wings relax ever so slightly, just enough to lazily flap in blissful response to the finger massage. They press and rub against me, randomly changing pressure and position so that one spot is never feeling quite the same as another. I close my eyes, diverting all my mental power towards experiencing this as much as I can possibly manage. I wordlessly moan as he continues, planting barely-registered kisses on my snout and face. My tongue lolls out of my mouth as I pant like an animal, putty in Anon’s hands.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It takes me a minute to realize that Anon had stopped at some point, and another to recover enough motor control to shift myself over, looking at him head-on from on top of him. I don’t speak, but he knows what I’m thinking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I hope you were paying attention. That will be on the test. As will this…” He plants his hands on my waist, shifting me around a bit until he finds a spot he’s satisfied with. He leans over a bit, looking past me, and then swiftly catches my tail that was - up until that moment - still wagging. I settle my front half back into him as he gently rubs my tail, occasionally flicking the tip of it with his thumb. This is interesting and all, but...wait, I’ve thought this before...</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So, uh, is this-!” Anon interrupts by roughly slapping my ass, causing me to yelp and push myself up. I glare at him and he smirks in response.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah, that’s it,” he says, cackling. Jackass. He responds by getting a handful of my ass in both hands and squeezing hard, his fingers reaching towards my inner thighs and his thumbs pressing against the base of my tail. My wings flare again and I collapse back onto him as his fingers prod and spread as much as my skin-tight jeans allow, much more aroused than I was seconds before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Wow, these really do get in the way, huh?” he comments. Before I can even grunt questionably, a button just above my tail clicks open, the fabric loosing its grip on my waist ever so slightly. His fingers wriggle into the new gap, slowly sliding my pants past my hips. His hands return to their resting spots on my ass, now separated only by thin black panties and our waning restraint. At this point I’m content to let him do whatever he wants. I’d get my turn eventually. Probably.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He flips us onto our sides, and I wrap my arms and my free leg around him, desperate to pull him as close as possible. Our lips meet as one of his hands gently squeezes my ass, my leg pulling his waist towards me. I experience an abject clarity, as if Raptor Jesus had opened up the secrets of the universe to me for just long enough to make an extremely important revelation. In this moment, I am Fang, and not Anon. It is Anon that is laying with me, and not Fang. Which means that the strange bump currently pressing into my crotch is not just any random muscle, but in fact, Anon’s penis. I break away from the kiss to gather my breath and reveal my findings to Anon. Before I can start, he grabs my waist and forcefully thrusts into me, that lump of flesh grinding against something very sensitive, and my findings come out as a garbled gasp.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He didn’t bother with any snarky comments this time around, electing to simply suckle on my neck and worm one of his hands under my shirt and onto my breast while grinding his waist into mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fuck…” I moan. Anon hikes up my shirt and dives right in, taking one of my nipples into his mouth and sucking hard on it. Is this all just primal horniness, or are these Fang’s fantasies made manifest?</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Told you I know all my favorite spots,” Anon backs off for a moment to speak, then returns to tongue-bathing my milkers. I really need to stop blasting all my thoughts into the open.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s way worse today, is it the horniness or the confusion?” For fucks sake shut up holy shit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon chuckles and turns me on my back, lifting himself above me. My wings protest but some shifting convinces them to spread sideways around my shoulders rather than outwards. He starts planting kisses on me, starting from my neck and slowly making his way down my chest, gingerly kissing around my navel multiple times before sliding down in between my thighs. He lovingly caresses them as if they were sacred idols, and I moan in anticipation. He's inches away from the most sensitive parts of my body, his tongue flirting with the idea of exactly what I need. He looks up at me, eyes half-open, hot breath washing over my panties, which I'm just now noticing are damp from something that definitely isn't sweat. Then he...then he...oh shit. I clamp my mouth shut before any more of my inner thoughts can escape. His eyes narrow and his smirk widens, the rest of him completely still except for his breathing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You know…” The smugness in his tone is revolting, and I just know these next few minutes are going to be pure agony. “I feel like I’m doing a lot here, and not getting much back.” Every word is directed straight into my crotch, my teeth clenching as I latch onto the sheets in a desperate attempt to keep quiet. “Hell, I’m still fully clothed, and you’re just sitting back and letting me do all the work.” Don’t fucking say anything, don’t give in, it’s what he wants. “Even now, you’re just kinda laying there. Sure, I could dive right into your ptero pussy right now, drive you absolutely wild beyond anything you could imagine. I know all my favorite spots, after all.” Please just stop fucking talking, I will never live this down if I falter now. “But what would I get out of it? Playing Ringer Rock or whatever would probably be more fun…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s Rock Ring!” The words force themselves out of me, and I grab my snout to hold it shut.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh, you’re right, my memory must be hazy. There might be some other things I forgot, I think I’m gonna go jog my memory.” I scream into my closed snout as his cheek brushes against my thigh. “Hm, you say something?” My nostrils flare as I fail to calm myself down, my arousal and irritation and anticipation all mixing and swirling and begging to be expressed. Please for the sweet love of Raptor Jesus eating my fucking ptero pussy you goddamn son of a bitch. The words bounce around the inside of my mouth, only sputters and incoherent noises escaping.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You’re gonna have to speak up, Fang. Is there something you want?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“PLEASE!” I scream to the heavens to deliver me from this fucking bullshit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Please, what?” The heavens have forsaken me. There is no God here. Only Anon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Please eat my fucking ptero pussy you stupid fucking-!” The rest of my sentence is devoured by a loud, ecstatic moan that would be embarrassing if I gave the remotest shit about anything else right now. Anon yanks my panties to the side and I practically explode as he smothers his face with my nethers. I reflexively grab his head and press it further into me, his tongue lapping at all sorts of immensely pleasurable spots that I really hope I can remember after this is all said and done.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Holy fuck!” I have no control of my voice and I have no desire to control it. His tongue wriggles against me and slips inside.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“FUCK!” My hips buck against his face as his tongue attacks what’s inside while his lips attack what’s outside. I moan somebody’s name, but I’m not sure whose. I writhe uncontrollably under his relentless assault, not a single lick or suck or flick is wasted somewhere that wouldn’t provide maximum results. I drop words entirely, ecstatically moaning and groaning in between every rapid breath. Even my horniest jack-off session couldn’t hold a candle to this. Pressure and pleasure builds up to an apex, and one final suckle on the most sensitive part of my body sends me screaming over the edge.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“SKREE-ONK!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">My arousal immediately turns to horror as the least-sexy noise I have ever heard comes out of my snout and lingers painfully in the air. My breath gradually slows, any potential afterglow completely erased as I stare at the ceiling. I don’t dare look down, for I know Anon’s expression would kill me on the spot. I don’t dare speak, for I know Anon’s response would kill me on the spot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel him crawl up, gently settling down on top of me and nuzzling my neck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You know, I think that was actually kinda hot…” he murmurs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“R-really?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fuck you...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure to give you a couple more before we’re done.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“A couple?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Dozen. You can’t possibly fuck them all up. But before that...” He sits up, shifting forward and onto his knees, putting his crotch directly in front of my face. “I think I need a bit of a break.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">I figured it would have come to this eventually, but to actually be faced with the beast itself was an entirely different matter. I could see it straining against his pants, begging to finally be set free. I could probably get back at him…</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Don’t even bother. Quit stalling.” I tentatively place a hand on his thigh, my thumb lightly brushing against the edge of the bulge. I feel something strange stir within me, and the idea of coming face to face with my own cock and balls suddenly doesn’t seem all that bad. In fact, it was actually kind of exciting. Both of my hands pressed against the bulge, two of my fingers navigating the buckle and popping it open. His pants slacked and dropped a few inches, the top of his cock outlined against the elastic band of his boxers. He yanks his pants down the rest of the way, the entire length revealed against the thin layer of fabric. I can feel my eyes dilating, my breath quickening, my tail wapping, my wings splaying, like that ruined orgasm had never even happened. My hesitation is gone in an instant, and I yank his boxers off, and his dick’s first act of freedom is to fall out and hit me straight on the snout. I barely register the impact and Anon’s chuckle, taking it into my hand and- holy fuck was it always this big?</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah, I really don’t know how you lug this thing around all day.” I don’t acknowledge the response to what was supposed to be contained within my mind, and I bring a second hand in to assist the first. It didn’t make it look any smaller or easier to deal with.     My mouth waters, dangling open as my hands slide up towards the top, then pull down, revealing his glistening dick head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Watch the teeth.” I’ll have to ask him about the telepathy thing later. I slide his cock into my mouth, already well lubricated with my saliva. Further and further along my tongue it goes, finally stopping at my cheeks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hoh, shit…” At least that shut him up. I glance up and we make eye contact. For once, he doesn’t look smug or like he’s about to crack some stupid joke. I know all my favorite spots, too. And with some effort, this tongue could work wonders. I pull backwards to flick the tip with the tip of my tongue and suck on the edges of the head. His entire body twitches and he moans in delight, his cock throbbing against the sides of my mouth as I slide forwards again, wrapping my tongue around the entire girth. I settle into a relaxing rhythm, every suckle eliciting a pleasured grunt and every interesting tongue maneuver earning a mirthful moan.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon gasps, grasping my crest and coaxing me backwards. I give one last hard suck as his cock pops out of my mouth, covered shaft to head with my spit. He unbuttons his shirt and takes it off, tossing it to the side. Fuck, did I always look this good? He doesn’t say anything, scooting backwards and falling onto me, his dick landing right on my mound with a ‘plap’ as he nuzzles my neck. His hands trace paths up my arms, meeting my own, and our fingers interlock. He shifts his hips, the head of his dick pressing against my opening. No teasing, no bullying, no smug comments; he thrusts, flesh parting and caressing the new guest as we moan together. Euphoria floods me, and all at once every emotion I had tended to washes away, and every concern and fear I had been harboring vanishes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So that’s what that feels like,” we murmur in unison. He pulls almost all the way out, then slams it back in to the hilt, a shockwave of pleasure blasting over me. Another slam and another shockwave, over and over again. I wrap my arms and legs around him, pulling him as far into me as possible. My wings join in, a feathery blanket brushing against his back. He adapts to my leg-lock, shifting gears to shorter, faster thrusts. My eyes roll into the back of my head, a guttural moan of lust and pleasure collapsing from my snout as he jackhammers my pussy. He stops at the height of a thrust, on the precipice of ecstasy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“GO!” I scream in pure desperation. He slams his entire body into me, screaming into the pillow as his final thrust starts the chain reaction, a tsunami of orgasmic relief crashing against me as Anon’s seed fills me, finally sating my primal instinct-driven desires. Sweet afterglow takes us.  He smothers me against the bed, his scent intoxicates me, his tongue makes love to my neck as I rub his back. Our breathing synchronizes, and for a brief moment, we become as one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I love you, Anon.” The most beautiful words I’ve ever heard flow across me like the finest silk, making everything feel a thousand times better than they just were.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I love you too, Fang.” The most satisfying words I’ve ever spoken fill the air like a blissful song, making everything feel another thousand times better than they just were. We lie in each other’s embrace, closer than any other couple on earth possibly could be.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So...round two?”</div>
