The motherly ptero answered</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It's Anon" you tell her, even you can hear how close to tears you are</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Is everything alright, honey?" She asks, you've called her like this before</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah, it's prom night, y'know?" you try and laugh it off</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Samantha hums before responding "Want to talk about it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah" you choke out, nodding despite being alone in the room</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I remember, just before your prom night we heard Lucy squealing in her room. She was so excited." Samantha sounded lost in her memory</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You couldn't find the strength to respond</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You were a good husband and an amazing father, Ripley and I are so proud of you, Anon."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There was no point fighting the tears running down your cheeks now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Thanks, mom." You sob out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You and Samantha talk a while longer, both of you sharing the pain of losing the most important person in your world</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You may have lost Fang but she still left you the greatest gift you could ask for, a family.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Given the day's occasion, you couldn't help but look back at the pictures your daughter took on prom night with the young man she's been with ever since.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His size and brawn almost reminded you of Spears. He even had that look of calm intelligence duelling explosive fury, albeit still nascent. And Lucy in her mother's dress, the night as a whole, was a bittersweet memory.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Grug didn't make you feel like you had to pull pages from Ripley's playbook to keep him in line. Polite, respectful, sharp, and so sweet on your daughter that you could see the love between them from a mile off even then.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That's why news of him proposing after they both graduated college didn't shock you in the slightest. Your daughter was ecstatic, and you had to hold back the lone tear of pride that she was doing so well for herself after overcoming that transitionary phase of young adulthood, flourishing just as Fang, sweet Fang, did.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That's why you were sitting in the car outside the wedding venue, getting everything out now so you wouldn't ruin your little girl's special day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You had already gone over all those pictures of Fang even before Lucy was just a twinkle in your eye. You would have given Grug your old tuxedo but retailoring it wouldn't taken too much, so now those wine-stained sleeves were coated over in drying tears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tears of sorrow when you went over the part of the book where Fang dropped off and Lucy picked up. The only pictures you had of the funeral were in your head, and even those were almost too much to bear.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But even why you wept changed as you watched all of those birthday photos and life's firsts start to roll in. Her first steps, her first violin, bass, and guitar, the first time she stepped out of your hands and into school. All those pictures with grandma and grandpa. Raptor Jesus bless Ripley and Sam.</div><div class="fanfic-line">> High school, prom, and then the pictures she had mailed you from college. And now that blank page that was going to be filled with wedding photos.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You wish she could be here to have seen all of that. To see this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Later on the ceremony starts up and you walk her down the isle, keeping it all together for her when you see her in her mother's old dress, wearing that amulet of amber.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You're strong for her when you think it's time to step away, one last time, for her to be wed to her man.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And you almost falter when Naser, somehow looking barely aged, taps you on the shoulder and hands forward a guitar.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her guitar</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Lucy turns to you and gives a smile that tells you this was her idea.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Dad, before we start, could you play something for us? I know she would want you to."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You almost break down but smile through the freshly welling tears as you take it and place the strap over your neck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There's no question on what to play.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's her song. It's the one she guided your hands on and wrote out in her head, passing it on to you. It's what you would play whenever Lucy couldn't sleep as a child and needed something to her lull her to sleep, and what you would sit and play when it felt like you couldn't go on any further.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You can only shut your eyes and go through it all. The dam breaks and you swear for one last time you can feel her hands guiding yours again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All of it comes tumbling down as you finish the song off, all that's left to do is fling your arms around your daughter a final time, tell her how much you love her, how much her mother would've loved her, and step away after she squeezes you tight and lets go.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A few hours later while she and Grug are entertaining guests you can't help but sit off to the side, trying to recompose yourself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You're so wrapped up in thought that you hardly notice when your side of the bench practically raises and a meaty, claw-tipped hand settles on your shoulder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You swear this is the only time Ripley has done this without meaning for it to hurt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He's still a grizzled stone of a pteropatriarch, somehow keeping muscle and an imposing stature on into old age. But there are some worn-out features to match; a milky eye and a few missing teeth. There's a fatigue behind the one he can still see out of that took up lodging when Samantha died and never left.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Everything passes for a while before he speaks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I wanted to tell you something before we both go off and probably drink ourselves blind. You did it, son. You're one of the biggest reasons why my granddaughter is getting the happiest day of her life. You succeeded as a man and, more importantly as, a father. You didn't break even when it felt like everything was falling apart, and you did what a father is supposed to do. You kept everything together even in the face of total despair, all for her. You're a man I'm proud to call my son, and you can golf with me anytime."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You can only inhale deeply and say thank you before you get one of the ptero's rare pats on the back along with a smile as he gets up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He was right. Just like you're the reason why she's here, she's the reason why you're still here. All of it, all of it for her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For her</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You sit down on the park bench, your back complaining louder than it has in years</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Volcadera bluff was a beautiful place but you had grown to hate the damp coastal air in your old age</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Lucy used to chuckle when you complained about your bones but these days she just looked worried</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You feel a pang of guilt, you really shouldn't be a burden on her, she's busy enough</div><div class="fanfic-line">>People walking by don't pay you any mind, just an old man in the park, where did all that time go?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You heave a wheezing sigh that rattles your chest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You really shouldn't be out here, too many medical problems to be away from the nurses long</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You're old enough to make your own choices, damn it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>High pitched squeals catch your attention</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A gaggle of children, human, and dino alike are chasing each other</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You probably sat on this same bench and watched lucy play tag just like you are now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You just... Can't quite remember that far back</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You remember her wedding, you remember the birth of your grandchildren, you remember Ripleys last words to you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You remember Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You lived a good life, didn't you? Certainly a long one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Seems like the only people that visit parks are the very young and the very old</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You content yourself to watching the children play, utterly unaware of the lives they're going to lead</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's funny that no matter how many old people warn us to cherish our time we never do until it's gone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You've done your fair share of it after all, even if you know your grandchildren won't take it to heart just yet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your eyelids are heavy, did the walk here tire you out that bad?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You lean against your cane, maybe you can take a quick nap before you go home?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Just a few minutes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When you open your eyes again you feel so much lighter</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Someone's sitting next to you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Pure white like an angel, with wings to match</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She gives you a smile that you could never forget, a smile from a rooftop so long ago it may as well be another life</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hey dweeb, what kept you so long?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">-ENDING FIVE OF FOUR-</div><div class="fanfic-line">-The journey of a lifetime-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkg8jHM6guw</div>
