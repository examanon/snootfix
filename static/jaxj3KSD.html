This is told from Fang's perspective.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Lately school has been pretty chill, maybe it's the skin- I mean… Anon, the one</div><div class="fanfic-line">that I got a crush on since he conforted me that time on the roof and made me</div><div class="fanfic-line">feel "safe" and calm.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I approach the school, go to the hall entrace to find Trish and Reed sitting</div><div class="fanfic-line">on the front rows of the hall. As I sit down and continue to chat with Trish</div><div class="fanfic-line">while Reed looks stoned as shit, I spot Anon at the entrance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oi Anon, sit with us!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I reserved a place for you, bro!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ugh, here it comes the skinnie."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After Anon sits right besides me the principal everyone covers their ears to</div><div class="fanfic-line">prepare for him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"ALLLLRIIIIGHT! So, as you know, you are all seniors. As such you'll need to</div><div class="fanfic-line">guide the younger students in order to put them in the right path, help them in</div><div class="fanfic-line">making their choices and so on. Without further ado, I'll give Naomi the mic."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Me and Trish pull back our heads while Reed is still in Dino-land and Anon looks</div><div class="fanfic-line">bored as fuck. How could you blame him?</div><div class="fanfic-line">That bitch goes up on stage and starts speaking with her nauseating voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh my~ Thank you so much for coming to the presentation of our program for</div><div class="fanfic-line">junior students."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As she speak, she starts displaying on the whiteboard via the projector several</div><div class="fanfic-line">slides.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Everything goes well, until I see a picture of Anon, standing in place with his</div><div class="fanfic-line">shoulder over a photoshopped anime girl.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And the photos go on, and on, and on…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Everyone starts laughing at the sight of these photos while I try to process</div><div class="fanfic-line">what just happened.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the hell are those photos?!</div><div class="fanfic-line">I remember that Anon said something about changing schools because of a</div><div class="fanfic-line">"unexplicably bad problem": maybe this is why Anon actually transferred here?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look towards Anon's seat, which became empty: he has rushed towards the hall</div><div class="fanfic-line">doors and I immediately follow him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon sprins towards the exit of the building, running like hell.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"ANON! WAIT *pant* A *pant* MINUTE *pant* GODDAMNIT!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He doesn't respond to my pleads and simply runs towards the street… I couldn't</div><div class="fanfic-line">catch up with him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck! Where does he live?! I can't even go to his house!</div><div class="fanfic-line">Aaargh I should have asked for his address, goddamnit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I return back to where I came from, where I can see Reed waiting near the</div><div class="fanfic-line">principal's office door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey Reed. Why are you waiting here?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey Fang, the principal got a hold of Trish and he's scolding her."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh really?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then Trish comes out of the door, sobbing like a little bitch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I do not know what even should I say about this whole situation I mean… She</div><div class="fanfic-line">just doxed my new friend in front of dozens of students and she's acting like</div><div class="fanfic-line">she's the victim here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why… did you do this…? Was this really fucking necessary?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm- *sniff* s-sorry…"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I get even more pissed at her: "Oh? You are sorry? YOU ARE SORRY? WHAT THE FUCK</div><div class="fanfic-line">IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT MADE YOU THINK THAT IT WAS RIGHT TO DOX HIM IN FRONT</div><div class="fanfic-line">OF MULTIPLE PEOPLE?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish couldn't reply that well but I could at least hear these words:</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I-I j-just scared t-that the s-skinnie would s-s..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Would WHAT? SPEAK UP!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She explodes: "I WAS SCARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU AWAY FROM OUR BAND!</div><div class="fanfic-line">OUR FRIENDSHIP! I DO NOT TRUST HIM."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As she wipes her tears with her hoodie she continues.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Some nobody comes into our school, enters our lives and ruins our band! He</div><div class="fanfic-line">hasn't once told us about where he came from, what he actually does, NOTHING!</div><div class="fanfic-line">Can you even consider him as a friend?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the hell?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then Reed spoke with a unusually disappointed and righteous tone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Trish, that was, like, uncalled for. He's not a bad person: I just think that</div><div class="fanfic-line">he doesn't want to stand out. But still, what you did is wrong. You should</div><div class="fanfic-line">really apologize to him."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She didn't answer at all, keeping her head low.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm going to leave the band for a while… I need some time for myself."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish looked at me with even more watered eyes, as her world shattered</div><div class="fanfic-line">completely.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He looked at me with sorrow and a sad look on his face: none of us could have</div><div class="fanfic-line">believed what just happended today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The day goes by and the only thing that I can think of is Anon. I hope that it</div><div class="fanfic-line">didn't damage him that much… I send a message afterwards to see if he's alright.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">FANG: Hey are you ok dude?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After an hour and half I didn't get neither a "read" notification or any kind of</div><div class="fanfic-line">response. God I'm getting worried about him: I hope to see him tomorrow so I can</div><div class="fanfic-line">repay the favor that he gave to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">## The next day... ##</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So far I've been nervous for the entire way up to school and when I arrive at</div><div class="fanfic-line">the Volcano High entrance I do not see Anon anywhere.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's understandable, given yesterday's events. But I can't shake the feeling</div><div class="fanfic-line">that something really bad is going to happen…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Principal Spears appears in front of me and asks me to follow him in his office.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe it's about Anon?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm glad that you followed me in my office, Fang."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No problem sir. So you wanted to talk about Anon, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Pretty sharp, if I say so myself. Yes, that's right. I've tried to call Anon's</div><div class="fanfic-line">parents but they do not seem to care about their son that much considering that</div><div class="fanfic-line">they seemed unfazed by what I've told about them. So I was thinking: why don't</div><div class="fanfic-line">you go check up on him?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Me? Really? I mean sure I can go. But I do not know where he lives."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He gave me his address, then he put his oversized hand on my shoulder and with</div><div class="fanfic-line">a sort of "parental" but earnest look said</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I have great hope in you for putting Anon back to his feet. You may go now."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yes, thanks Mr.Spears"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I got out from there and now I have the responsibility of putting Anon back on</div><div class="fanfic-line">track. Ugh I'm getting scared… Am I even capable of doing something like this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Deep down I know that Anon needs my help: he helped me on the top of the roof</div><div class="fanfic-line">so I want to repay the favor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey Fang, have you heard of Anon?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed pops out of nowhere with his usual care-free tone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey Reed. No, sadly he didn't respond, but the principal asked me to go to his</div><div class="fanfic-line">house to check up on him. He gave me Anon's address."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Cool! So where does he live? We can, like, go check up on him together if you</div><div class="fanfic-line">want."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hesitantly respond "He lives in Skin Row."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh… That's gonna be a little problem… But oh well, if we are together it will</div><div class="fanfic-line">be safer."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed's not wrong. Skin Row is regarded as one of the worst zones of Volcadera</div><div class="fanfic-line">where usually junkies and/or other humans live. I'm a little worried to be</div><div class="fanfic-line">honest… For the sake of Anon I will go there but I first want to speak to Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">alone, maybe he feels more comfortable if I am the only one there."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Reed, thank you but I think that Anon will only speak up to me, at least for</div><div class="fanfic-line">now. Please!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed looks at me with a sad look but agrees.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ok then… Let me know how it went: if you need my help, you can, like, call me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sure. I'll call you later."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So I decide to check on Anon after the classes, get the bus and see if he's</div><div class="fanfic-line">alright.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*So this is where he lives… No wonder he's on welfare* I think to myself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I knock on the door, no response whatsoever.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I retry knocking on the door, and again I do not get a response,</div><div class="fanfic-line">After insisting I saw the door open only to be presented with a very pale Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">and bags under his eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Jesus you look like shit."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Did you come here just to shit on me like everyone else? Then fuck off."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No Anon wait! I came here to check up on you!" He looked at me with a</div><div class="fanfic-line">dumbfolded expression before registering what I just said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"... Come inside then. Welcome to ‘La casa del Shithole!’"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He closes the door behind me and I sit on the floor while he just throws himself</div><div class="fanfic-line">on the bed with an empty look on his eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon… I'm sorry that this happened to you I mean- I never thought that her of</div><div class="fanfic-line">all people would pull a stunt like that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He suddently flinches and snaps at me, surprising me with a very unnatural</div><div class="fanfic-line">angry tone and open wide eyes</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"OH REALLY? WHO DO YOU THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN HUH? SHE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT</div><div class="fanfic-line">COULD HAVE PULLED A DICK MOVE LIKE THAT!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The usually calm and composed Anon that I knew transformed in a rage-filled,</div><div class="fanfic-line">maniac looking one which really scared me as it was something that I've never</div><div class="fanfic-line">believed could come out from someone like him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon please, just calm down. I came here to speak to you… I'm sorry that Trish</div><div class="fanfic-line">pulled a stunt like that! I never though that she would do something like-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"IT DOESN'T MATTER! NOW EVERYONE IS JUST THROWING SHIT AT ME! I NEVER WANTED</div><div class="fanfic-line">THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So I was right that he changed schools for this. Sure the fact that he posed like</div><div class="fanfic-line">that in these pictures was cringy but still…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I did whatever I could to remain as anonymous as possible! I didn't do anything</div><div class="fanfic-line">to piss someone off and what do I get?!?! I GET RIDICULED IN FRONT OF ALL THE</div><div class="fanfic-line">FUCKING STUDENTS! AND IT'S ALL THAT PURPLE BITCH'S FAULT! I-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before he could finish I approached him and put his head on my chest to make him</div><div class="fanfic-line">calm down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Look Anon. I know that you are having it rough, I understand your pain. You</div><div class="fanfic-line">helped me on the top of the roof when I felt distressed about my identity, my</div><div class="fanfic-line">problems… Now I want to repay the favor by helping you. You need support right</div><div class="fanfic-line">now and I'm here for that." I said this in the hope of calming him down… But it</div><div class="fanfic-line">didn't work: instead he steadily jumps out of the bed and backs off from me,</div><div class="fanfic-line">shouting like a madman.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"NO YOU DON'T GET IT! I TRIED EVERYTHING TO BE A SHADOW, TO NOT BE NOTICED BY</div><div class="fanfic-line">ANYONE AND YET…and yet… I find you three, especially your schizo friend who</div><div class="fanfic-line">hated me for no good reason…"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He collapses on his knees and as I slowly approach him…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I just… Leave me alone please… I don't want to speak to anyone right now."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Devastated and without anything worth to say to him, I simply leave, closing</div><div class="fanfic-line">the door, hearing him sob and in fetal position on the floor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I just wanted to help him… And yet, I didn't manage to do a single fucking</div><div class="fanfic-line">thing. I'm so goddamn useless… But as I went home I could not shake the feeling</div><div class="fanfic-line">that something terrible was going to happen. I can feel it but not understand</div><div class="fanfic-line">what exactly…</div>
