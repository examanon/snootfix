He and Fang had had the weekend off of their respective jobs for the holidays, and both were enjoying their time together. The cold autumn wind sent a chill through the house but Anon tried his best to ignore it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Fang slowly approach. She stood there wordlessly. After a minute, he sensed she had something to say.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hm?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">She didn’t respond.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He paused the game and turned to face her, and…</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her eyes were red and puffy. She had tears running down her cheeks, and her body was wracked with small sobs. He was shocked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">She didn’t respond.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang, what’s wrong?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Panic crept into his voice. Was she playing a joke on him? What’s going on? She had complained she felt weird the past few days, is she hurting? Is she in pain? The thoughts whirled through his head like a tornado. She just hung her head and cried more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon…” She choked out. “Do you promise not to be mad?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">His heart sank. Oh fuck, what happened? He stood up, skin prickling with anxiety.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang, what’s wrong? Please, tell me. You’re scaring me.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She sniffled and held out her hands. He couldn’t figure out what it was he was looking at for a brief second. Then it hit him. Pink plastic. Two little lines. His heart dropped even further into his stomach for a second. All the worst case scenarios played through his mind. But then he pushed them aside, and his heart floated up and out of his throat. He ran over to her and picked her up, startling her. He kissed her stomach repeatedly, as tears of joy ran down his cheeks.</div>
