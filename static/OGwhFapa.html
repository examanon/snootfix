His combat boots kick up a storm of loose sand that puffs through the air, not unlike the mist of blood that had done the same moments before. If there was any air in his lungs the bullet hitting him hadn’t knocked out, the sudden and unrestrained impact with the ground pushed it out. He wasn’t aware of the shouting coming from his few teammates around him, or the cracks of more bullets firing through the air. All he could hear was his blood rushing through his ears, and the same blood rushing out of his body.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The other soldiers cleared the area, calling out for him to hang on. He coughed weakly, feeling wet flecks contaminate his breathing and the taste of copper in his mouth. After a few minutes the gunfire ceased and the two other soldiers descended on him. One undid a spool of gauze and, with her knife, cut open Anon’s combat harness and BDU to ascertain the damage. Her faced paled as she saw it wasn’t just one bullet, but several. Several blooming roses trickled their petals down his quivering pale chest, breaths trying to fill his lungs but not fully being absorbed. The familiar wet gurgling came from the human’s throat, and a lump filled in the soldier’s own. Her face felt hot, her eyes burned. The other soldier shared her look. Anon weakly muttered something, snapping the soldier out of her trance. “What? What was that?” She said putting her face closer to his. Someone needed to hear what we wanted to say. “Fang….” He called out softly. Her eyebrows betrayed her confusion, looking back to the other. “Who?” She mouthed, getting a shrug in response. A tear trickled softly down Anon’s cheek as his hand lifted in the air. His eyes had glazed over, he likely wasn’t seeing anything clearly. “Fang….” He called again, his hand finding the soldier’s face. She struggled to resist the urge to pull away. “Is… that you…?” He asked before another hacking fit wracked his body. She struggled to swallow. She… she should say something right? She looked back to his mangled chest. She closed her eyes, praying for strength. “Yeah.” She responded, taking his hand. Anon lifted his fingers, cupping the side of her cheek. She stroked his hand softly as she watched the life pour out of him, unable to do anything. She began to shake, tears welling up in her eyes. This was uncomfortable for her to say the least. Eventually his hand went slack, and dropped to his side as the tears fell down her face.</div>
