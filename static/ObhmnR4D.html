It certainly was before its previous owners were evicted, having gutted the house as they left</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At least they left the insulation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The bare wooden studs of the unfinished basement display new pipes and wiring, intertwining themselves with what could be salvaged from the old construction</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The bank handling the foreclosure offered to put a hold on the house until the basement was finished, but the added cost was too high for the new homeowners</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He already had to get the Aaran's to cosign on the mortgage. The rhinorexes handling the transaction were struggling to hold back their laughter as Anon's credit score rolled in</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Years of bad decisions rearing their ugly heads at last. Those JPEGs were not worth it in the slightest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The housing market wouldn't tolerate a delayed decision. It was either now, or in 10 years. Now was the prudent choice, if a little stressful</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Between discharging his debt and his long-term investments, an austere living was in the forecast. Nothing he hadn't done before</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Nonetheless, Anon felt like he was signing his own execution papers when he penned his signature for the mortgage</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The large talon-gouged grooves the pen received when Ripley signed the agreement chilled Anon's blood, an image of those talons buried in his flesh burning into his mind</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The way the patriarch looked at him, the sharp edges of the ruined pen digging into Anon's fingers as he wrote, only amplified that feeling</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If both Fang and Samantha weren't sitting between them, Anon is certain he'd have a permanent imprint of ptero claws in his shoulder</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A phantom pain strikes him at the thought of it. Ripley is well within driving distance to this place. He can even walk here on his days off</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Likely half the reason he agreed to cosign in the first place</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At least the home inspector assured everyone that the house is structurally sound, complete with an absence of asbestos and lead paint</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon can't deal with both Ripley and the house trying to kill him at the same time</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The scratching of a pen startles Anon out of his thoughts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang stands beside him, marking off the list in her hand as she inspects what Anon picked up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Paintbrushes, paint rollers, caulking tubes and the guns they slot into, sandpaper, drywall patch...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The list goes on and on. All Anon really cares about is her smile and nod of approval as she strikes paint off from the list</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He really needed that, especially after going back on his commitment to never touch a paintbrush again. He can still taste the bitter solvents from that naval paint</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There's plenty of work to do before they use the paint. Gives him time to get his demons under control</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When she sent him off with the paint swatches, there was no mention of what sheens the paint should be</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He didn't even know paint had sheens. He only applied the naval paint he was given, not caring about anything written on the label</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe that's why he had to keep redoing those sections all the time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The receptionist was very patient, listening to everything Anon had to say while giving out well informed suggestions</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Semigloss for here, satin for there, eggshell everywhere else</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Must have to provide that advice a lot, considering how many do-it-yourself commercials plaster themselves on television these days</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon did receive a warning that the chosen colours would need more coats to properly cover the old paint, but how hard could that be?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All those tutorials on YouSnoot made it look easy enough, combined with what he remembers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The colours inside those cans weren't Anon's first choice, but he warmed up to them when Fang justified her reasoning</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Who would want to come back from a bad day at work only to be greeted by a house as grey as they feel?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The wet autumn weather decided for them that the inside of the house would be the first thing to tackle</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The sun scrapes at the horizon when Anon arrives home from work anyway, and paint doesn't apply well in the wet and cold environment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hiring professionals for the job is off the table. After the down payment, the only reasonable option left for the renovation is doing it themselves</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After a few raises in his salary and a promotion or two, Anon figures he'll have some financial breathing room</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Until then, the only thing on his mind is getting the inside of the home looking somewhat presentable for the holidays</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As it stands now, anyone coming over is going to assume that he's dealing out carfe on the side. Reed may be able to appreciate it, but no-one else will</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The irony of having a housewarming party outside the house it's meant to celebrate doesn't float well with Anon either</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on dweeb. The house won't paint itself."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A friendly smile mirrored by Fang's eyes greets Anon, having grabbed the tools she needs for the day</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A plastic tarp lays in the garage, containing a variety of bought and borrowed equipment. Anon still can't believe Ripley loaned out that much</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Or that he had that much in the first place. He does remember Fang mentioning something years ago about a pirate princess needing a boat however</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon sounds out a short laugh, grabbing the tub of premixed drywall patch. He follows Fang out from the garage and up the stairs to the first room on the agenda</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A protective covering on the floor made of tan cloth comes into view as Anon rounds the corner</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Some of Ripley's equipment is already in place. Two stepladders and some work lights stand in the center of the room waiting to be used</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon takes one of the work lights, plugging it in and aiming its bright beam parallel to the wall</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Shadows of nearly imperceivable defects leap out, scared out of hiding by burning luminescence</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang takes the other light, following his lead as she aims it down another wall section for her own work</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Soft music from a stereo and smalltalk fills the air between the two as flexible knives apply spackling onto the various imperfections dotting the walls</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon is almost scared out of his wits when Fang leans precariously over her ladder, stretching out to get at one finicky defect</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her own wings balance her, acting as a counterweight to her movements. It calms him, to see them so full, to be reminded of how far she's come</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A pebble of drywall patch falls off her knife during the maneuver, the tanned cloth below fulfilling its purpose as it intercepts it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He'd have to take the cloth outside and shake it out later. No point in having a floor covering if you drag the dirt and grime on it elsewhere</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sunlight from the windows shifts as they move room to room, patching up the walls as they go, staining their old worn-out clothing that they sacrificed for the task</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The clothing that had marked their lowest times was perfect for the occasion, giving them a noble purpose before finally laying them to rest in a landfill</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The tinge of melancholy that needled its way into Anon's heart when he saw Fang in that baggy top lessened when his eyes caught her face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her shoulder length hair cascading down, the absence of grey eyeshadow, her vibrant citrine irises, and a smile that means the world to him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She's been really fussy over his opinion of her hair lately, whether he wants to see it long again or if he likes it the way it is</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She may not like his indecisiveness on the matter, but she cannot disagree with his reasons. She is Fang, and Anon will love her just the same</div><div class="fanfic-line">>An amused hum leaves Anon. One of the few times in his life where his baldness is a boon: he has no hair for flecks of paint to get stuck in</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But Fang? Fang is another story</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Between her wings, elbow feathers, and hair, there's plenty of frustration to be had in removing dried paint spatter</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...He should get her some extra shampoo the next time he's out shopping</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's spine protests as he rises, signaling the end of today's work</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang had tagged out a few minutes earlier, almost stumbling over the cloth sheeting as she ambled towards the kitchen to reheat some food for the two of them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A few rooms had been worked through, the spots of drying compound making the wall look like the pelt of an ill leopard</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He'll have to go back in to sand it later, after the rest of the rooms have been patched up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon scrapes the leftover spackle back into its container, ready for use tomorrow</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The sounds and smells of the microwave reheating leftovers drew Anon out of the room towards the kitchen</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Samantha had reveled the opportunity to cook for more than just herself and her husband again</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With both her children absent from her home, her cookbooks and practiced techniques of feeding 4 hungry ptero mouths for almost two decades had been difficult to change</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her old routine of dropping by their old apartment from time to time, delivering home cooked meals and bags of extra food, carried forward to their new home</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon may not match a ptero's appetite, but that's alright. More for his better half</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He spots Fang as he enters the kitchen, giving her a slight surprise as he leans over and lightly kisses her snout on his way to the sink</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not to be outdone, she waits until Anon lathers his hands with soap before she makes her move</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She swoops in, wrapping her arms around his torso as her wings follow suit and encase him in a feather cocoon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The aching soreness in Anon's spine disappears with the pressure of the ptero squeezing him from behind</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Through what little light remains, Anon can make out her arms, her hands. The redone tattoo blossoming out on her right hand, and a blank canvas on her left</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One day soon, he's going to colour that canvas with a ring</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A soft hum emanates from Fang as she leans further into him, clutching tighter</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Did he say that out loud? He knows he hasn't been able to keep that under wraps, but she's never commented on it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe she's just being polite, or maybe she's waiting to see it before she truly believes it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He really needs to go all out on the proposal to surprise her at this point. Just one major hurdle left to solve before he can plan that out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"C'mon Fang. I can't wash my hands if I can't see them."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang relents slightly, drawing her wings back just enough for Anon's view of the sink to return</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The microwave sounds out as the last of the soap spirals down the drain, beckoning her to its contents</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She holds on a little longer, giving one last squeeze before moving for the microwave</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Dinosaur nuggets slathered in barbecue sauce is just what the two of them need right now</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Before Anon knew it, he had gotten himself into a routine</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wake up, work, return home, work some more, eat, clean up, sleep. He hadn't expected it to be so tiring</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The youthful energy that let him sacrifice sleep at a whim is gone, lost to time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The room he's currently in is slated to be turned into his man-cave, at least until the basement is finished</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That is assuming, however, that he can fit the couch through the narrow hallway leading into it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If he marks up the wall while moving it, so help him Raptor Jesus, someone or something is going to pay</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Probably him. Hopefully, they'll have some paint left over for the odd scuff or repair</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This room in particular has had a rough time. Anon is certain that there are more patches on the walls than there is actual wall</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Dull grey dust billows around the room, their feet kicking up at the piles of sanded drywall compound</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A fine film of it is coating absolutely everything. The floor, the windowsill, the boxes filled with items yet to be unpacked, and even the light fixture above them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon can only be thankful that the respirators Fang had him pick up stop all that crap from entering their lungs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Smoking for years had already done a number on them. They don't need anything else risking a premature departure</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She does look rather silly, with how the mask stretches across her snout. The hardware store has an entire aisle dedicated to the masks, various styles and fits sorted by species</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A hearty laugh had escaped him when they found out that large was the only size that would properly fit her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His skin and clothes are going to need some quality time in the shower and washing machine. The dust had anchored itself quite effectively on both him and Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He can feel the moisture in his skin getting leeched out by the powder as it adheres to him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon stretches upwards, popping his spine back into a position more fitting of a modern human. Only Principal Spears could pull off the caveman hunch with any grace</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A quick glance over towards Fang reveals she's almost finished too. A single patch remains with Fang expertly flattening it smooth to the wall</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He's going to need to buy another stack of sandpaper soon. The drywall patch works both ways, filling in the valleys of the sandpaper, quickly rendering it useless</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang looks to have suffered the same fate as Anon, having adopted a similar layer of dust. Anon would never have guessed her clothes were black by how grey they appear now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That extra shampoo he picked up has finally been paying its dividends, mixing in with the comforting scent of Fang as he drifted off to sleep the past week</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tonight appears to be reaching the same conclusion, as she finishes sanding and turns around to Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She really is monochromatic now. A spark of humour hits Anon: she would make for quite the feather duster, wouldn't she?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He'll just wait until... until</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His eyes glaze over at the sight, his body frozen in place</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The grey coating of drywall dust blends onto her skin, hiding away her age, her scars, her dark tattoos</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The image pierces into Anon's heart, his soul, as he looks at someone who is alien to him, yet completely unforgettable</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A ptero that looks like she never had her heart broken by him, entirely unblemished by the ravages of time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Only her shorter hair and lack of makeup form cracks in the illusion</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The content smile adorning Fang's face molds itself into confusion and then worried concern as she looks over the petrified human</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Anon? Are you alright?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His words are caught in his throat, unwilling to let themselves be heard</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Clods of dust shed off Fang as she makes her way over towards Anon, exposing the troubled history engraved on her skin once more</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The mirage shattered, motion returns to Anon's body, as he blinks away his emotions, his memories</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He tries to sound out that he's fine, but it comes out weak, watery. Fang doesn't believe him in the slightest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Half of him pleads to the heavens for Fang to just accept it and let the day continue, as if nothing had happened</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The other half is utterly grateful that she understands him so well, that she wouldn't accept such an anemic lie</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang gently takes his hand in hers as she suggests they take the rest of the day off to give them some time to themselves. They've done enough for today. There's always tomorrow</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The dust can be vacuumed later, after a hot shower removes the grime from their bodies</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The remaining daylight hours are spent huddled together on a couch, hot drinks and small snacks within arm's reach</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A warm blanket binds the two together as the soft glow and quiet sounds from a TV propped up on boxes immerses them in a nature documentary</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Who knew there are birds that dive into the ocean as if spearfishing for prey? They look like they're flying underwater</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon wonders if Fang can do something similar. Maybe he should find an indoor pool for the both of them one day</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A light snore vibrates from beside him, announcing Fang's departure from the waking world</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's still too early for Anon to sleep. The restless thoughts that he was distracted from have returned, swirling around in his head</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The TV screen winks off at the remote's command, plunging the room into darkness and his thoughts into limelight</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She looked just like she did in high school, before everything went so horribly wrong. How different would their lives be if he didn't fuck up?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All the possibilities and speculations eat away at him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What if he was stronger, smarter, more compassionate? What if he was the man that Principal Spears and Moe had seen all that time ago?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What if it didn't work out with Fang anyway? With her talent, she might have decided that Anon really was one of those weeds, holding her back, stunting her dreams</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What if the life he has now is the best outcome? That all the hardships they endured actually meant something?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Are they even going to finish painting on time? It's been weeks now and no paint has made it onto the walls</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What if he is still dreaming, ready to wake up on that rusted hellhole of a vessel, paint brush in hand?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Careful to not wake Fang, Anon clutches her tighter still, as if he's inside a dream that's about to end</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A dream he is desperately trying to pull her from, into a world that is real</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The dreaming ptero answers back, the soft feeling of Fang's embrace tightening against him, anchoring his mind back to reality</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All his fearful thoughts drain out of him, the serenity of silence finally gracing his mind</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon looks down at her, the streetlamps outside beaming their amber light onto the two of them, his breathing stilled as he listens</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Is she awake?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Only her soft snores greet his ears, her chest rising and falling against his</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The answer to his question will have to wait until morning. Life experience has taught him the risks of disturbing sleeping pteros</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For now, sleep is the best option to him, especially with the love of his life entwined with him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tomorrow... tomorrow they'll start painting</div>
