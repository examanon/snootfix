                <div class="fanfic-text">
                    <div class="fanfic-line">5 - CARDS ON THE TABLE</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A few days come and go and I find myself once again on Trish’s couch, with her wrapped around me, enjoying each other’s company. Or at least, attempting to. Trish seems particularly distant and unmotivated today as we lie, the din of the television mostly ignored as she stares at nothing in particular.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Trish,” I whisper. No response. “Triiiish,” I quietly call again, lightly rocking her. Nothing again. Desperate measures. “Triiiiiiiiiiish,” I repeat as I sneak my arm towards the base of her tail. Still quiet. Starting from the base, I slide my palm across the top of her tail and down towards the tip. She reacts, but only barely, lazily thwacking my hand with her tail and murmuring something unintelligible.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Come on, talk to me. What’s got my amethyst angel so down?” Trish sighs with disgust.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fine, but only if you promise never to call me that again. That sounds like a stripper name.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Deal, that hurt to say anyway.” Trish takes a bit to collect her thoughts, squeezing into me in the process. Her voice is a low, sad whisper at first.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I just...I’m tired of all this secrecy and gossiping and avoiding each other. Tired of having to make excuses just to see you. Tired of having to watch the clock to make sure we don’t get yelled at. Tired of feeling guilty for not divulging everything to everyone.” Discontent worms its way into her voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m actually kind of fucking happy for the first time in months. And everyone just wants to fuck it up.” Discontent morphs to anger.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“‘Mama didn’t raise no skinnie-sucker, Trish!’ ‘Why are you hanging out with a murderer, Trish?’” Her mocking tone fails to hide the building storm within her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s like being with you means they don’t want to even care about me anymore.” Trish shakes with barely constrained rage.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why am I a lost cause to them now? Do they want me to go back to languishing in my fucking room all day? Do they want me to hold these stupid fucking grudges forever? God DAMNIT! I NEED them! But the fucking SECOND I do something they don’t want, they threaten to throw me away like fucking trash!” Trish collapses onto me, sobbing uncontrollably.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I hate it so fucking much, Anon. I just want it to go back to normal. And now I have to decide between you, and them, and...” Her tears drown out the end of her thought. I attempt to encourage her, but the lack of confidence in my voice is obvious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“They just...need time. We’ve got time, it’ll come around.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Unless a miracle happens, you’re going to be homeless at the end of the year.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Trish, we-” I’m cut off by a buzzing in my pocket. My heart drops. I know exactly what this buzzing is for. Trish looks at me with wet eyes, and I pull out my phone to check the time. Ten minutes until Trish’s mom normally returned, and I had to be out of the house to prevent an ‘incident’.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“FUCK!” Trish screams, burying herself into me. Goddamnit all, this is the worst possible time. I can’t stay, though. A parent-child shouting match…</div><div class="fanfic-line">A chill shoots across my spine and throughout my entire body.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Can I really just leave her like this, though?</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You wanna come with?” I offer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“...yeah.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">I dial the taxi service as we rush ourselves out the door. Within minutes the taxi driver appears and we’re off on our way to Skin Row. Trish is still visibly upset and exhausted by what had just happened, and the driver stays uncharacteristically silent as we roar off towards my part of town.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The taxi blows past what would normally be ‘end of the line’ and comes to a screeching halt in front of my apartment building.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’ll put it on your tab, go,” the driver says, ushering us out of the taxi. Before we can even close the door behind us it screams down the road and out of sight. We hurry into the relative safety of my apartment as the sun dips below the horizon. Trish wastes no time flinging herself onto the bed and loudly groaning into it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why on earth did I agree to this. She’s going to be so pissed.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Something tells me it’d be worse if you stayed. And it wouldn’t have been right for me to just leave after that.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah...thanks.” I take my place alongside Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s just...damnit. Why can’t everyone just get along?” Trish chuckles, albeit sadly. “That sounded kinda weird coming out of my mouth, but still…we share something special. Something we don’t share with anyone else. And everyone...everything seems like it’s trying to take us apart.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We’ll work through it, Trish. They just need time. I know I probably sound like a broken record at this point, but it pays to stay optimistic.” I wrap my arms around Trish and pull her close, bringing our eyes to bear.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I know, and I appreciate it...but…” Trish trails off, this particular thought not seeming easy to put into words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I know I said that I needed them earlier, but...do I? If they’re just going to hurt me, why bother keeping them around?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Not a good idea to burn those kinds of bridges. You said it yourself - barring a miracle, I’m gonna be in trouble real soon. We’ll need something to fall back on.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We could be homeless together.” I raise an eyebrow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I...can’t tell if you’re joking or not.” Trish just shrugs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Of course you could always get a job, you know.” I grumble, but the idea seems...slightly more palatable than it was a couple of weeks ago.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I mean, your dad is paying for the rest of the year, right? A few months to save up some money might go a long way.” Hmm. She’s right, but…</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You got anything better to do?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No…” I admit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Come on, how bad could it be?” I try to formulate a protest, but Trish pleads with me. “Do it for me?” I’m completely enraptured by her eyes, and her tone makes my voice catch in my throat. It takes me a few moments to finally break the spell, and I shake my head in an attempt to clear the daze.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Agh, you fucking...fine.” Trish cheers and hugs me tight, then starts pecking at my face with her lips. Her assault is relentless, lips planting on random parts of my face, tiny smooch noises punctuating each attack.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey!” Peck. “No!” Peck. “Quit that!” Peck. “Stop!” Peck. “AAAAA!” Peck. Trish cackles and snorts as I fail to evade her. I go to counterattack, holding her face still and all but ramming my lips into hers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Mmph!” Gotcha, you twitchy little hooligan. She relaxes in my arms as we kiss, and we pull apart a few seconds later with a satisfying pop. We cuddle for a while longer, then Trish’s phone goes off. The ringtone is different from last time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hmm? Oh, it’s...Reed.” Worry paints her face as the merry tone jingles in her hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You should take that. See if he’s willing to come around.” Trish hesitantly nods and then steps away to the bathroom to answer the call.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She returns a few minutes later looking...uncertain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Everything go well?” I ask.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Maybe?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Is it a start?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Maybe.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ah, wonderful. I guess it could be worse.” Trish snuggles up alongside me and we eventually drift off to sleep together.</div>
