My unga bunga caveman brain begins screaming at me once more. I LOVE PTEROS! I CRAVE PTEROS!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I really should find these sorts of thoughts concerning,  but I'm not in a position to argue with my brain at the moment. There's more hormones than blood currently flowing through my veins, so I just weakly give in to my male instincts. I break my kiss with Fang as I grab hold of her legs, pushing them up and next to my head to give myself a better angle as I begin pounding into her even harder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I LOVE PTEROS! I CRAVE PTEROS! I'M PTERO FIEND! I'M PTERO-ING THIS PUSSY UP. These thoughts keep repeating through my head, but I know I'm not mumbling again this time. Instead, I'm just making autistic chimpanzee noises, which causes my goth lover to give me a look of growing concern. My hip thrusting becomes frantic at this point, reaching super sonic speeds that I'm sure are going to give my dick friction burns, even with Fang's girl juices coating it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's not even looking at me anymore, her head turned to the side and buried in her hands in complete and utter embarrassment. I know she's enjoying it though as I feel her legs shaking in my hands, as well as a fanning of my butt from the fast pace her tail is wagging. The thought of her orgasming is more than enough to also topple me over the edge as well.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel something travel up and down the length of my shaft. My legs firmly plant themselves on the carpet. I bury myself into Fang's vagina one more time, my world spinning as I let out a mighty torrential storm of semen deep inside her. In between my massive loads,  my sex-addled brain tries to think of something catchy to top this moment off with. I immediately think of my childhood, and the mediocre game I spent the most time playing. For some reason, I think it's a good idea to scream it to the world.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"SONIC HEROOOES!" The volume I shout this at feels like I'm ripping my vocal chords, and my partner simply looks up at me in complete horror. "SOOONIIIC HEEEEEEROOOOOOES!!!" I yell it even louder now, black splotches covering my vision as I feel myself slipping into darkness. "Sooonic-"...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My eyes suddenly jolt open as I look around. I'm back in my bed, sans my girlfriend, and I slowly lift my sore body up as I prepare to go and look for her. I don't don't even have to leave my blanket though, as I realize she's currently sitting at the edge of my bed and next to the night stand. My nose picks up the smell of flavored tobacco, and I finally realize what she's doing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Shamefully I crawl over my flimsy mattress to join Fang, my legs now dangling off the edge of the bed frame and next to hers.  She knows I'm there, as she's quick to extend a wing around my back like a consoling arm. Outside of that though, she doesn't do anything else to acknowledge me. She instead focuses on finishing her menthol first, dumping the ashes in a glass of water after every large puff before also dumping the butt in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So." Breaking the silence, the pterodactyl finally speaks up. At the very least, she doesn't sound very angry. Just tired. Her head isn't still facing me, but I can tell now that she's looking at me with her peripheral vision. "What the hell is Sonic Heroes?". I silently mouth a string of profanities and curse my luck. I have a lot of explaining to do...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Note From Archiveanon: I am going to personally kill you bruh. My fucking sides reached oblivion and now i am suffering lmao. Good stuff.</div>
