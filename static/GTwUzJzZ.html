                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: A Helping Kiss~</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Naomi, Stella</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: NSFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Kaiser</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So, what'd you need to come see me for, Naomi?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi smiled at Anon after just closing the door to the classroom they resided in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh, nothing special, I just wanted to ahn... Catch up on what's been going on with you and Fang!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That felt like a fake reason to Anon, but he wasn't one to complain, so he had to play along with it for now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It feels like you ain't telling me everything, Naomi... You okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The façade fell pretty quick, especially when she sighed and quickly got up close to Anon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The suddenly closed distance made him flinch back half a step, the closeness feeling a bit uncomfortable to him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Usually only Fang was allowed to get this close to him, especially with the fact that Fang and him were together at this point.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I wanted to know if you and Fang ever, uhm.... Y-y'know."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She started making weird signals with her fingers, an O shape with one and the other, her index pointing towards the O.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When the pointer finger suddenly started going into the O shape, Anon realized what she was doing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I... W-what?! I mean, that's none of your business! Naomi what the hell?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi pouted and got even closer to Anon. This started getting into dangerous territory.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Because I don't trust a monkey like you to know how to properly treat a girl! I know you know that I'm not exactly the biggest fan of Fang, but I'm even lesser of a fan of you messing up my plans by hurting her! So... did you do anything with her or not?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon couldn't really speak from the sheer audacity of this woman in front of him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"First off, rude. Secondly, no not really, but we've gotten close to intimate if that's what you mean, Naomi." Speaking with an air of aggressive sarcasm, Anon hoped to make her back down a bit from her assumptions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Good, because I'm about to teach you how to do it properly."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yea, I-wait what...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Speechless is all Anon was at the moment, did he hear her correctly?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi rolled her eyes and smiled slyly at Anon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"What, has a girl never offered to you before? Are you still a virgin?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I don't like talking about my uh... personal life, and uh....-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon fumbles with his words for a bit, while Naomi watches in amusement. She was relishing in this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So you're a virgin..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"...Yes..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This was the part Naomi was looking for. She decided to make her move.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Getting in close, she traced her finger along Anon's chest and looked up into his eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You wanna know something interesting?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Leaning in, she whispers to Anon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"My tongue's over fifteen inches long."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There was a sudden tightness in Anon's pants that didn't make him too proud. Looking down, Naomi noticed it too. She looked back up and gave him this bewitching stare.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she knew how to press his buttons quite well it seemed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You wanna know the best part? It's flexible.... want to give it a test?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He knew what she was doing, and he knew better, but something just pulled him out of his rational thinking state...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"...Y...Yeah...sure, go ahead..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Good boy!" Was all she said in response.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon knew he was going to regret this every second of his life afterwards, but his hormonal curiosity got the better of him today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi slid down to Anon's pants without even registering it at first, that is until he felt his pants swiftly drop to his ankles before he could even blink.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Something told him this wasn't her first time, it was probably already hinted at by how she lured him into this situation in the first place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Does she regularly cheat on Naser? Poor bastard, he hoped this wasn't a regular thing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>While he felt bad for Naser, that one moment stuck in his head rather negatively...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>'Fang, promise me Anon won't do anything fucking creepy, okay?!'</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As if Anon wasn't right there... That was a little fucking rude.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He looked down to the nerdy dino girl playing with the outline of his bulge in his undies. Her sly smile made him shudder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Soon, next came the thin under-fabric getting pulled down, just imagining what this was going to be like made him harder than any diamond imaginable. He was ready for this... He hoped.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Holy Shi-uh, Jeesh, Anon. They say humans are...usually kinda small. This thing looks like it could kill someone! Hang on, lemme test something..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Just the reaction alone filled Anon with a smug pride, the only other woman to ever see Anon's junk was Fang, but sadly nothing had happened between them yet, it was simply some teasing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He was nowhere near as hard as he is now as to when he was back then, this just... felt so bad in the best of ways. It did things to him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His day dreaming was cut short from quite the girly gasp from Naomi, he looked down to see what had gotten her so flustered. That is until he saw it, her comparing his willy to the length of her fore-arm.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>From her elbow, to the knuckle of her middle finger, Anon's manhood stood proud like a torpedo waiting to burst the enemy's hull.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now, considering Naomi was a smaller dinosaur, he couldn't tell if it'd compare if his partner was larger, but still, this meant he was big.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"This thing's even thicker than my wrist!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well duh, Anon thought. She had pretty feminine and slim arms, so that wasn't too much of a surprise, but still, the near-worship of his dingaling felt amazing in the worst ways possible.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>'Okay calm down, Anon. Don't let this shit get inside your head, that's probably what she wants...' Repeating the thought, Anon kept his cool.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That is until he saw her whip out that tongue of hers... The thing was a bit longer than his cock, and half as thick, but the way she moved it told him this would be interesting.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>*Bluuegh* "Sthee? Sthexshy, huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The way she did that was pretty cute in a dorky sense, but then his teasing mood melted the minute she started assaulting his rod.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A sharp intake of air from Anon barely kept him on his feet, grasping at the desk behind him to keep from stumbling.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The strange, bumpiness mixed with a strangely soft, but almost rough texture wrapping itself around him made him almost bust instantaneously, even popping his head into her mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She began taking in more of Anon into her mouth, letting her large tongue explore even further than before. Soon enough she was tickling his testes with the tip of her tongue. It was hell and heaven at the same time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Soon enough she got to halfway, gagging noises causing her to swallow and push on his dick, almost making him whimper out like some bitch in heat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fucking... God, Naomi! H-holy *HNNGH* fuck! C-calm down a *huuaagh* little, cutie!" The last part slipped out of his mouth before he could stop.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He felt her pause, looking down to her, she seemed to be on the verge of what looked like giggling with this red hue on her face. He could tell she liked the sweet words and encouragement.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The way her tongue was just barely above room temperature, and slick with her slippery spittle was getting Anon to sweat profusely, the immense pleasure keeping him on his toes, in order not to cum so fast.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She started slowing down, much to Anon's relief. For a small while, she played with his head, but he had this nagging feeling he should prepare himself for some thing to come.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That's when she did it. Tongue snug around his dick, she managed to hilt his cock inside her entire mouth in one go. Anon's legs started shaking, he couldn't keep his voice in any longer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When she started to moan with him inside of her mouth, he sprung out the worst, most whorish moan he thought could've been imaginable. He couldn't help himself, the way she toyed with him sent him over the edge.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Holy shit, Naomi. I-I think I'm gonna cum, holy shit!" Saying that sentence took effort, as he had to pause inbetween words to keep from busting right then and there.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When Naomi started speeding up her head-bobbing, he knew she wanted him to finish in her mouth. The increased volume of her moans made it practically impossible to hold back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Before the time came, he felt her hands come up to his and guide them to the back of her head and pushed down onto the back of it, making her hilt completely.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She wanted him to fuck her mouth like it was a toy. He decided to oblige.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not holding back, grabbing handfuls of her smooth, manicured hair, he began humping away, no rhythm, no pauses, just pure instinct. By this point, his only goal was to fill the hole he was fucking with as much baby batter as he could humanly produce.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The fact there was no resistance, except for purposeful gags and gulps for added pleasure made it easier for Anon to breed Naomi's mouth with reckless abandon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>By this point, he had forgot about volume control and was making the occasional mewl that raised just a bit too loud, but at this point he stopped caring, his only goal, was to fill a hole and boy was he going to do it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"HERE IT COMES, NAOMI. SWALLOW IT, BABY. OH SHIT-" Was all the warning she got as he hilted inside of her mouth, her moans indicating she was ready for it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi used her tongue to coax at Anon's sack, even managing to wrap a bit it around his said balls, massaging them gently as he unloaded what was possibly months of pent up frustration and lust straight down her throat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi however loved to see messy orgasms, as much as one wouldn't expect from such a prim and proper girl. Halfway through the tirade of orgasm, she took her mouth off Anon's penis and began stroking it with ungodly speeds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">-----------------</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella had been hearing weird moaning coming from the end of the main hall to the left side. She noticed it came from the very last classroom to the left.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Weird... usually that's reserved for after school tutoring, what the heck could somebody be doing in there now?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The curious Stegosaurus made her way quickly to the door of the classroom, looking to just barge in to see what the individual was doing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hey what the heck is going on in-" Her eyes went wide at what she'd just now witnessed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The largest manhood she'd ever seen was being stroked like some magic lantern while its thick, pearly cum made an absolute mess of the red, sweaty face of one of the smartest, nerdiest, prim and most proper girls in school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The titanic rod belonged to none other than the newest student of Volcadera Heights, Anon. A shy, introverted, and in her opinion sort of rude guy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The face she saw on him didn't show any of that, the way his eyes were rolling into the back of his head, that strained grimace mixed with his shirt's collar being drenched in sweat, while his face was absolutely flushed from the pleasure he was receiving from said girl, Naomi.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella felt like a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming freight train filled with the heaviest materials and wasn't stopping. So powerful and even a tad slow, enough that she could possibly evade this, but the absolute terror and mesmerizing view kept her stuck in place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Wh...Whu.... I-uh.... Huh...."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her body felt a little hot from the scene, reminding her a bit of her lack of activity, and the oncoming time of estrus made it even more difficult.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When all was finally said and done, what seemed like eons finally ceased, Naomi swallowed everything, looked up at Anon with the most lust-drunk smile. She even had a wet patch on her crotch from committing  only fellatio.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Think you could go again, Anon? That was...pretty fun. Also, if you keep your head clean and keep everything the way it should go, I could...keep doing this if you'd like."</div><div class="fanfic-line">----------------</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon couldn't find the strength to respond and just made a pitiful and whiny "uh-huh" to her, barely managing to keep himself up straight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He froze when seeing Stella standing there, and he was about to tell Naomi, when Stella simply put her finger up to her mouth, telling him to 'shush'.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He even saw her do what was the equivalent of biting your lip for a dinosaur as she slowly, stealthily closed the door without a sound, leaving Naomi practically unaware.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He could see his new single digit audience watch from the little window in the door...it seems she expected to see more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"J...just gimme a sec, Naomi. That took...a-a lot outta me..." Whipping out a handkerchief, Naomi wiped everything off of her face, looking a bit more presentable now. Smiling after, she started nuzzling up to Anon's side while he recuperated.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Like I said, big boy. You keep your act up, keep it nice and clean, keep it good... I'll do this any time you want. You're definitely...worth it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The way she said it so hungrily, almost with authority, scared Anon a bit inside but at this point, he knew he was trapped. So he let it go. Might as well ride this out as long as he can, then.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella was still just standing there, fogging up the glass with her creepy, wide-eyed stare...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This was a mess he got himself into, and he wasn't sure it was going to end very well...</div><div class="fanfic-line">---------------</div><div class="fanfic-line">>To Be Continued???</div>
