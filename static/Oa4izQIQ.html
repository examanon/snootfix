                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: How Fang's Mom Figured it Out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang, Samantha, Ripley, Moe, Trish, Reeda</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Haremanon</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Summer 2040, Volcadera Bluff</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was a hot day, perfect for dinos and bearable for humans.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Perfect for a family meeting in the Volcadera Park, grills included.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I've always wondered about Trish, dear."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang froze.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Rea, I understood. If the biological father of her child didn't want to be part of her family, then it was his problem, not hers. Why, you even helped her move into your house. I'm still proud of you for that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"T-thanks, mom", she whispered barely audible.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"But Trish!" Her mom clicked her tongue. "I didn't understand her. She was not the sort to accept something like that, not with you, not with anyone she cherishes, especially not her own children."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Why, it was almost as if this man never existed to her. Very strange."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Suddenly, Lucy wanted to be at the other side of the field, where Anon, Dad, and Uncle Rex were bunched around a giant grill. She so did not want to have this conversation now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I'm sorry, dear. I might overstep my boundaries", she continued. "But... for the sake of clarity. I must ask you this. I ask for forgiveness in advance. But please answer me honestly."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Did Anon force this onto you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>So, this was it. Nearly twenty years of marital up and downs, challenges and joys of parenthood, lies and deception, and now it was all coming to the surface. It was almost freeing, in a way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For a terrible moment Fang considered to continue lying, considered spinning a yarn, but she loved her mother too much for this. Almost as much as she loved her own children and Anon, blood and water.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"No. He did not cheat on me, mom."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It clearly wasn't enough, as Mom's raised eyebrow expressed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It... God, it started around the time Anon came back."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I remember. You were in such a tizzy, back then, especially when he asked for your hand in marriage."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah. But, err, we... we actually met again a bit sooner. When we were still in university."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I don't remember who started it. Not Anon, I know that for sure. He'd never cheat on me. You know that, mom."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Ah, I do. It was yet another strange clue, one that didn't quite fit the situation at hand."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang's wing flickered nervously.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It was weird, yeah. I cared about Trish and Rea lots back then, already. There were moments that, umm... We were closer than before."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Mom looked not quite scandalized.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"We didn't do anything like that." She hesitated. “Yet.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"But I guess there was a reason why a lot of girls hit on us during the final years."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"And then Anon came back, and things got, err, off the rails."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Rea and him were always close, but she wouldn't have done anything with him unless I were ok with it, and Trish was..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Rather deep in denial over her attraction to humans, still?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well, err, yes, but no. She just..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang tried to find the right words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"They didn't piss her off at all?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Anon was pretty much the only one to get a rise out of her like that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"And we did live in a community, so they had to hear us...", Fang trailed off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh, these poor girls", her mom finished dryly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Much to Fang's relief, in that moment a new arrival interrupted their talk, with Trish running over and tackling her firstborn son.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The tall triceraptos weathered her without trouble and embraced her with laughter as his father and family-members approached to greet him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang took the opening.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Well, I have to go now! Wouldn't do of me not to greet my nephew and all that!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Sit."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She obeyed. When Mom had that tone, there was no arguing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”So, Anon didn’t initiate this. Was it Trish?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Rea, actually”, she replied. “Went and asked me if she could sleep with Anon, just this once.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”… well, at least she tried to be honest about it.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”I did want to say no at first.” As she continued, she got more and more emotional, her feathers spreading out wide.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”But… I was happy somehow. If she had just gone ahead and tried, I wouldn’t have forgiven her, but she asked and… I understand if you don’t agree with me, but back then she was so scared. That I… That I would yell at her and throw her out for even thinking about it. She was one of my best friends already. I’d never done that to her. Not when…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”And you agreed?” Fang simply nodded, her feathers slowly settling down again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”It was hard convincing him. I used to think he was an exception, but… men do stay loyal to their mates, don’t they?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Darling, these people you thought of are the loud exception. Trust me in this. You have nothing to worry about with your husband.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Right. It was supposed to be a one-time thing. Was. But, err, we didn’t really stop.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”I can tell.”</div>
