                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: The Amazing Stego Saiyan</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Trish, Stella, Rosa, Babs</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Anonymous</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just another day in the life of your average stego-saiyan, the most powerful lifeform at Volcano High by a large margin. We catch up with our bright green protagonist as she makes her way towards the lunch room, joined by her best friend and sparring mate, Rosa: Maestra de la Chancla. Rosa was a tough combatant, but of course she was no match for Stella. Together though, they were a fearsome duo that no one at the school dared to challenge.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">On this particular day the school was serving their usual rectangular frozen pizzas, such a meal would be unsatisfactory for a being such as Stella. Fortunately, she had come prepared with homemade sushi rolls, hand crafted by her own hands (with help from her parents). She sat down next to her best friend, whom also had a meal prepared for her by her madre, full of all the nutritional value to keep at least three dinos of a lesser power level going for a full day. For her this was simply a lunch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The two friends chowed down on their respective meals, intermittently stopping to discuss things such as Rosa's gardening exploits or Stella's anime hobby (addiction). This all came to a sudden halt, however, as a figure loomed over the pair, casting a great shade in the sunlight coming from a nearby window. No doubt, both of the masterful combatants were preparing for yet another fight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey Stella!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's Babs smiling widely as she looks down at our heroine. The big magenta rocker dino is a good friend of the duo, amongst other Volcano High students.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh hey Babs! What brings you to our mystical table today?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I just wanted to thank you for that tarot reading you gave! After you said wheel of fortune meant good luck and change. I asked Nathan and Erin about forming a band and it went over great with them!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Babs was grinning widely as she enthusiastically laid out the details for what happened. Stella's tail was swaying back and forth from the positive recognition she was receiving.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So yeah! Nathan does the vocals and plays bass, I do guitars and keyboards, and Erin plays the bongos. We've been doing it for a month and it's been a blast!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Aye, you should come play music for a fiesta with mi familia sometime!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I would sure try! I don't know much about Latin music though..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh no no no, don't worry! Abuela will teach you, you'll do fine!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Babs continued looking at the excited ankylosaurus with a bit of concern but nodded along to her statement.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anyway! I just wanted to say thanks again Stella!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course Babs! My tarot readings are always correct!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That wasn't true for the most part, but the heroine was beaming with confidence from the praise she had just received to the point she couldn't resist stroking her ego a bit. Babs took her leave and lunch proceeded as usual for the dynamic duo of dinos. At least, until, another familiar voice to the pair piped up. Albeit, sounding much more enthusiastic than usual.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stella! Your tarot reading was right!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was Trish, the tiny triceratops seemed to be more cheerful than normal</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Excellent news! What hardships did the chariot help you overcome?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, I started running an online merch store. It was for VVurm Drama and all, stuff like shirts, CDs, even aprons. At first it wasn't good... I wasn't selling anything and costs from production were building up. But you gave us all those tarot readings, and told me mine was about overcoming adversity. So, I kept production up and started advertising it even more, and now I can't keep stuff in stock!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"This is wonderful news, Trish! You should always trust in the heart of the cards, they will never let you down!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">More truth stretching, but who amongst this school dared to question Stella's immense power? Rosa looked on with a warm smile as the trike splurged the details of her trials. Normally the offer of an apron presented a great gift for su madre y su abuela, however, she believed they would not take kindly to Trish's "banda de adoración al diablo".</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella was beaming over all this sudden praise, her tail excitedly thumping against the floor. She was undoubtedly on cloud nine as she was showered with the recognition she felt she deserved.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anyway, thanks again for the advice! I'll see about reserving you two some spots for our next show!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We would be delighted to be there! Come back any time for another reading!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish then made her way back over to the table the rest of the band was sat at, and once again Stella and Rosa got back to their lunches. That is, for all of about five minutes. A sudden ambush struck the pair, students descended from them from all sides, rushing down their table at full speed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They quickly encircled the duo, all of them eager to talk to Stella. Amongst the massive crowd there was a lot of chatter, not much discernable, but some of it stood out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Thanks so much for your reading Stella!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Do you do palm readings as well?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Could you give me a reading too please?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The ravenous horde pined at our poor heroine, quickly overwhelming her with their sheer numbers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“H-haha, thanks everyone! I really appreciate all of your compliments!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This did not quell the crowd however, more questions and praise showered down on the poor stego. Her cheeks flushed a bright red due to all the attention, her tail had hit maximum overdrive as it thumped the floor like a jackhammer, and she glanced around the crowd at every new voice that spoke to her. Eventually, however, she could no longer keep it together, unfortunately she let it all out by fainting right then and there. She had been defeated for the first time in years, members of the crowd picked her up and helped her off to the nurse’s office. With this new found strength she had she would need to be careful, as it was clear that a consequence of it was greater attention from the forces of evil around her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With Stella the Stego-saiyan incapacitated, we will now redirect you to our alternate programming: “Rosa del Huerto”.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The passionate ankylosaurus stares off at a distant table with a certain longing in her eyes. At that table is Anon Y. Mous: the human transfer student, and a man of undeniable if not unorthodox charm. Unfortunately for Rosa, he was a man she wanted but could not have, loved but could not be loved by. Who knows what he saw in that heretic pterodactyl girl, what she had that Rosa didn't. She stares on as he takes a bite from his sandwich, letting out a soft sigh, her pupils shifting to the shape of hearts as she imagined a life with Anon, 'mi esposo'.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Yo no sé cómo empezó</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Solo sé que sucedió</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fue tal vez sin darme cuenta</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No podía ver la luz hasta que cerré mis ojos</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Y desperté pensando en ti]</div>
