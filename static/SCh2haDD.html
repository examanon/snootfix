It really worries me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I thought she had overcome everything dragging her spirit down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her innocent yet somewhat endearing racism was all but eradicated after she decided to learn of human history and all their struggles. Her problems with Fang were all but overcome after the two sister had their heart to heart. She had even achieved her goal of getting Volcano High into the records books by almost breaking a world record, which now put our school as the top when it came to sports.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>We even started dating. Wasn't easy at first, species divide and whatnot, but dammit, we've made it work somehow</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yet... something still seems to be eating away at my beautiful ptero GF's soul... and it's tearing me apart...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Did I say something wrong?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh god, I hope this isn't about little kiss Fang gave me as a thanks for helping her see how fucked she was being towards her sister...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I mean, I guess it could be taken as a form of cheating...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Shit. Way to go Anon. Fucking your relationship like you fuck everything else in your life!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fuck. Time to bite the bullet, I guess...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I find Nasera sitting by one of the benches in the back of the school. She's looking very dour.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It drives knives into my heart to see her that way...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I walk up to my girlfriend. She doesn't seem to notice me until the last second, at which point she forces herself to perk up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh, hey babe! H-how are you doing?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I could ask you the same thing," I reply, taking a seat next to Nasera</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I grab her hand and look deep into her eyes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Sweets... what's wrong? You haven't been acting like your usual self lately... and it's got me worried sick!" I start pleading with my girlfrield. "Please, if it's something I've done, I'm sorry. I'll do better next time, I promise."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Nasera's face contorts into one of sorrow as she breaks down weeping, each wail further driving the dagger already in my heart deeper and deeper.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh no...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Nasera grabs my idle hand and sobs, her breath ragged.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It's not something you've done, Anon... it's me..." Nasera whispers bitterly as she turns away from me. "I... haven't been honest with you from the start..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She takes a deep breath, almost as if steeling herself for what's to come.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Anon... My name wasn't Nasera originally..." My girlfriend tightens her grip on my hands as she forces herself to look me in the eye.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I-I was born as... Naser..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The words take the literal air out of my lungs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Despite having a thousand and one thoughts coursing through my mind, I can't find myself being able to vocalize any of them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I try to make sense of it. Try to understand the situation I've been trust into, to almost no avail...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>My girlfriend... the girl that lifted me from my previous life of shit, gave me a shot at something grander than myself, let me rise above what I thought were the limitation god and the universe deemed hilarious to curse upon me, the girl I fell in love with almost at first sight for her charm, her charisma, her ability to see beyond the pathetic excuse of a human that I once was...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...Isn't even a girl to begin with...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At that thought, my mind completely freezes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I just stare into Nasera—no... Naser's—beautiful amber eyes as I try to unfuck my brain</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The urge to laugh comes first.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Of course. How very funny of god, or the universe, or the demiurge, of whatever the fuck controlled reality to do this to me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In a cosmic sort of way, it was funny. Hilarious, even</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Build up all my hopes, all my dreams; make me think that I had scored in life, that I had made it... only to pull the rug right under my feet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Then the urge to cry starts to rear its head</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Despair, all encompassing threatens to grip my heart.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>How could it not when discovering that the girl that I love isn't a girl...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with cant ever and will never give me a child, that we'll never be a true family?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Rage comes next naturally</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I should get up from this bench, shout at Naser for her—his—deception.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Break this charade off, march off in a rage and never look back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This is an absolute betrayal, after all. Why go on for so long without telling me the truth, leading me on believing a fucking lie!?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I make my decision. One that I know will shape my future...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I look Nasera in the eye.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She flinches, probably expecting the worst</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I let out a sigh and steel myself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Without a word, I let go of Nasera's hands</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She closes her eyes and lowers her head in seeming acceptance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Without another word, I wrap my arms around Nasera, bringing her in for the tightest hug I could possibly give her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yes, I'm mad, yes I'm sad, yes I'm betrayed and devastated and all that shit that emotions make one feel</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But right now, none of that matters</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even if Nasera is Naser, even if she's packing a fucking sausage between her legs, even if she can never ever be what my primal monkey brain desires...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Nasera is still Nasera.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And nothing's going to change that for me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You're lucky I'm into that shit," I lie to Nasera, knowing well what I'm getting myself into</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But I don't care anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This isn't about me. It never was.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was always about her...</div>
