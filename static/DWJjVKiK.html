He's a special kind of retard, but he means well in every sense. He's got a weird thing against humans though..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You roll your eyes, knowing full well of Naser's weird human racism. He seems to like you though, at least. No sense on pondering it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Everything's going along, you play games, listen to some metal, etcetera, etcetera.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You look over at Olivia in her wheel chair, scooching around uncomfortably.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe she needs to pee or something?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her dad wasn't here either. Oh shit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Uhm...sorry Anon. I-it's just. It's bath night...and I usually have one by now, but... dad's gone for the time being and I dunno what to do."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You think out your choices...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You could gulp help her, probably... or.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You could just leave, give an excuse... to say bye...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That's such a horrible thing to do. Not even you would do that, what the fuck were you thinking?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If you needed help, you'd hope somebody, anybody would help you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With rising heat in your face and your ears, you stammer out...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I mean...if you n-need help or somethin...I could help you if..you know. You uh...want...me to?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Olivia stares at you, her face unreadable. The sheer unemotion makes you feel nervous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her face cracks, a 'pfft' and a giggle later, she's holding her stomach.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Damn, now you feel dumb for asking. Was that not normal to ask?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Gosh, Anon. didn't expect you to want to bathe the crippled girl so much, heheh."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You hold out your arms in defense of yourself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"WHAT?! N-NO LIKE, I WAS JUST SAYING, Y'KNOW?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You can't help your volume control, your spaghetti dropped and now it's code red all over in your mind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Re-laaaax~ I'm just messing with you, peach-fuzz."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Peach...fuzz?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Olivia giggles at you repeating her weird new pet name for you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You know...because you're kind of the color of a peach in a way, and peaches tend to be a little fuzzy, kind of like how your face is a bit fuzzy. It's cute."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You could've sworn you were completely bald from genetics, but peach fuzz? Maybe Raptor Jesus didn't hate you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"My offer still stands though, Olivia. I don't mind helping you whatsoever. After all you're my friend, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Olivia's playful mood falters a small bit, her smile tacked on unlike before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Come on, you don't need to do that, I can wait, dude. Besides... I ain't much to...look at."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon sidles up besides Olivia and gets her to look him in the eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"That's so not true, and you know it! You're really pretty, Olivia. Don't think otherwise. I get it, being... unable to walk sucks, but you're a trooper! Look, I've helped my grandma shower before, it's the exact same thing, right? How bad could it be?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Olivia looks taken aback a bit, but smiles smugly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"If you insist, big guy..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Man you really need to shut the fuck up sometimes...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>right now you're helping Olivia undress and get ready to shower.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>While at first she was smug, by the time her hoodie came off, then her shirt, then her jeans, and just being in her underwear, her tone changed drastically.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You go to help her unfasten her bra, but before you can, you realize it doesn't have a harness in the back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Uuuhhhh, Olivia... Where's the bra thing at? To unhook it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh! Sorry, 'non. I got it. It's in the front, just gimme a sec."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You see her arms fiddle near the front of her chest, and before long, you see her bra loosen and fall from her shoulders.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You gasp out a shy "Oh!" and look away, hoping to keep her from feeling too embarrassed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There was a pause, until then she opens up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Uhm... I need help with my underwear."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It takes you a second before you realize what she's implying.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You mentally prepare yourself with helping your friend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You walk up to her front and smile, hoping to ease the tension.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her embarrassment is palpable even from here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You begin tugging near her thighs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"alright, up."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Doing so, you get them to slide off as she goes to use her free hand to cover up her privates.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You almost let out a groan in sympathy, getting second-hand feelings of shyness from this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hey... sorry this is weird. But at least you get to shower, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She smiles a little and chuckles.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Y-yeah...heh, guess you're r-right."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Once done you align her to the bath, and notice there's a shower chair.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh sweet, your dad got you one of those chairs, huh? That's really nice of him!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yea, he's an amazing guy. I love him a lot."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your heart melts at that, knowing he really is a cool guy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You place a hand onto her shoulder to let her know the next step is coming.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For this you look away so as not to look at her naked form out of respect.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>you hear a tired sigh and look back into Olivia's eyes wondering what might be wrong.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You need to look at me when we do this, dumbass. I don't wanna fall and make your task harder than it already is. So just look at me, I don't care if you see my fat tits, dude."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You get a genuine laugh out of that</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Alright, alright! sorry, okay? Alright, now just put your hands on my shoulders, okay? I'll help you up."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You begin wrapping your arms around her upper body, realizing she's nowhere near as chubby as you initially though. Once you've got a good hold on her, you tell her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Alright on the count of three, I'll pick you up just enough to get on the chair, alright? Here we go."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Getting no more than a small "mmh-hmm" from her, you count down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Two</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Three!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Lifting her up, you step one foot into the shower and help her shimmy onto the chair, placing her legs into the tub itself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With that done, she goes back to covering herself up and she smiles to you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Uh...thanks, man. You really didn't have to do this for me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You roll your eyes and sigh with a smile.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Shush. We got this far, I'll be damned to not help you all the way through, okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You playfully rustle her hair in which she leans into it and giggles.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Time for the actual shower part.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now... how are you going to shower her without getting your clothes wet...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>May as well go with the flow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You begin stripping your top.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Olivia looks over and stammers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"What're you doing, man?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You shrug and tell her innocently,</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I don't wanna get my shirt wet, so I'll just take it off and help you bathe. Why, does your dad not help with the bathing part?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You feel like you might've overstepped a boundary here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"H-he does help with parts I c-can't reach, but I can just...skip that stuff for now..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"No! You are not skipping parts of your body, Olivia. That's how you get rashes and other nasty stuff! I'll let you wash the parts you can wash, and if you REALLY need help, I don't mind helping you one bit, alright? I'm here to help you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Olivia doesn't respond to that, and just quietly asks me to turn on the water. You nod and notice it has a temperature reading on it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh damn, does this heat up the water before spraying it out? Neat"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Noticing her calming down when you make small talk, you make sure to do this more often to keep her from shutting down to stuff around her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The whole time you turn on the water, you laugh when getting soaked by the shower, you help her wash her back, her hair, and when it came to it, you helped her down there when she asked and only if she asked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Once everything was done, you finally managed to get her dried, clothed and back into her wheelchair in a timely fashion. You even got some praise out of her for it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Damn, that's a record right there. Usually takes my pops a good hour and a half to do that. You did that in about half an hour. Nice job. Might just need to hire you!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You laugh at her gracious thanks and shrug off the praise.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"hehe, hey. What are friends for, huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It goes quiet for a good bit with you and her just smiling at each other.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That's when her facade falls. It started slowly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You could tell from her eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tears started to fall, a sniffle, then she put her head into her hands and bawled.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With the two of you sitting on her bed, you were able to comfort her, letting her fall into your chest, hugging her as tightly as you could.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There was no need for you to cry, in fact you felt the opposite reaction.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You just sat there and combed your hand through her hair and supported her back with your free hand, rocking her back and forth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Sssshhh, ssshhh sshhh-hey what's the matter? It's okay, it doesn' bother me one bit, alright?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After some more hiccups and tears, you finally hear her try talking to you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I...I-I'm so phugin' useless! I ha-hate being like thi-hi-his!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now it was time to start feeling that stinging in the back of your nose, that welling up of water in your eyes...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Olivia! Please! It's okay! I would NEVER think any different of you! Don't think of yourself like that. You're such a good person, o-okay?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You started burying your face into her freshly washed hair. So soft and nice, you kept rocking each other back and forth, neither of you wanting to let go.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You're a good girl... Your dad loves you so much, your friends love you... I love you too."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She sniffs, her crying dying down a little. You started rubbing her shoulder to let her know you're here for her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You smile again for the time you've lost count to, thinking of something that'd hopefully brighten her up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You know who else loves you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Wh....who?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You tilt her head up with a nudge to look in the direction of her rat, Guts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>During this whole thing you almost forgot his existence, but thankfully he existed at the best times when he's needed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Just seeing Guts in his cage set Olivia off again on another tirade of crying, burying herself deeper into your chest so much to the point you fall onto her bed with her in tow</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She starts mumbling apologies one after the other so quickly it's almost impossible to keep up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Seeing Olivia so emotional really does something to you. Someone usually so laid back just letting out this much sadness is jarring.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But you persist, you need to be her rock right now, and by Raptor Jesus you're gonna be it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What felt like a good hour passes by the two of you, Olivia just laying halfway on your chest, fiddling with your shirt, the occasional sniffle coming from her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Did you mean what you said, Anon."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You look down at Olivia who trying to look you in the eyes, but doesn't seem to muck up the courage to do it completely.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Did I mean what?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Y...you know. That...you loved me?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Well, yea of course I love you, Olivia! You're a great girl."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Olivia sighs in a frustrated tone, seemingly not getting the answer she wanted.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I want you to do something, okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You shrug, "Okay, what would that be?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Kiss me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your eyes almost bulge out of their sockets with that request.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"B-but Olivia...I'm with Fang! That's not something I can do..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>While going through this conversation, you both sit upright again and you notice the sun's gotten a bit closer towards the horizon. Must be around five or six by now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You look down at the miserable baryonyx leaning on you, trails of dried tears all over her green cheeks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I know! I know...but...you're the only guy's who's seen me like this besides my dad...I just thought that maybe...could you at least give me something in return?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You pause yourself there for a moment, thinking hard about this. You love and appreciate Olivia a lot, like a sibling even, but what she's asking is dangerous...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You can feel her scaly hand brush up and lay itself down on yours and you look her in the eyes again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You should really stop looking into her eyes...it's going make you make bad choices...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"...Alright...but just this once, okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Olivia looks down contemplating what's about to happen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You're also contemplating what's about to happen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You promise I get to?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You roll your eyes and try to smile through the situation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Well, duh. C'mere. You do at least get to have this, I guess."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Before closing your eyes and puckering your lips, you could see Olivia's tail thumping repeatedly on her bed. Looks like somebody was excited.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You guided your hands to Olivia's head, holding it by the sides and caressing her scaled cheeks. The thumping got louder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Bringing your lips together, you make sure to let it last enough to be enjoyable, but not long enough to turn into something more, lest you go over the point of no return with Olivia.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>During the kiss, the thumping reached maximum speed, and slowed back down as you parted from the smooch with her snoot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her eyes fluttered open and looked right into yours. The redness on her face never once leaving as she smiled at you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She gave you a near back-breaking hug, wrapping your arms around her as well.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Thanks, peach fuzz. That...that was nice."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You smile at her again, running your hand through her short green hair.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Glad you enjoyed it. Uh...sorry this can't, you know...be anything more, Olivia."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She deflates a little, but rebounds just as quickly, though you can tell her smile seems a bit more forced than usual.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Nah I get it, Anon. It'd be wrong of me to...get inbetween what you and Fang have, man, but...can I ask you something?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Mmmh? Sure, what is it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She looks down from you, the thumping having completely ceased by now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"If...i-if it doesn't ever...work out between you and uh, Fang. I'd be by your side if you wanted...me..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You fell silent at this, your arm still wrapped around your friend. Could you really stay this way with this kind of tension between each other?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"That's quite the proposal, Olivia. Heheh...uh... I'll genuinely keep that in mind, but you need to promise me something, okay Olivia?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She looks up to you, completely bewitched by you at this point. She leaned into you as you looked at her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Don't wait for me, okay? If you ever find someone out there for you, go for it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her smile never ceased, her having relaxed right into you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"On one condition, then."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh boy, this wouldn't bode well for you, but you'll bite.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"What's the condition, Olivia?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Gimme just one more kiss and we'll call it even."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You shake your head in disbelief and chuckle softly. You expected something much more than that, but you guess she deserved it after having literally let you bathe her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fine, but only one more time, okay? We can't be doing this...much."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The last part sent her tail thumping against the bed again, albeit a bit quieter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Deal. Now, c'mere."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe this wouldn't be so bad...you just hoped to Rapter Christ this won't spiral out of control.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hopefully.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The last thing to wander your mind before getting assaulted by the baryonyx was just how far this was going to go.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She needed it, so it wasn't nearly as bad as if this was under normal circumstances...or at least that's how it felt, hopefully nobody would judge you for this if anyone found out...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The End...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For Now...</div>
