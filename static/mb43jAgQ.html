                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Movie Night</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang, Trish, Reed</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: NSFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Anonymous</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A green dinosaur tokyo drifts around the corner almost knocking me over.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“YOU’RE WAIFU A SHIT!” she yells back as she nears supersonic speed heading down the hall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like I needed that reminder. Especially with whatever scheme Fang has concocted to make our friend group whole again. I had already talked to Trish and we were on as good of terms as can be expected between someone and the person who tried to destroy your life and make you transfer schools again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s not a scheme Anon, it’s just planning out a time for us all to hangout that’s not band related. I told you this already.” Fang says this after elbowing me in the ribs. “Besides you’d do anything for your sweet tooth, right?” she can hardly restrain a snort as she says your pet name for her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Opening the door for you qt3.14 ptero gf you catch a glimpse inside the auditorium. Reed and Trish are already inside waiting patiently. Not one to wait reed has already started wolfing down his lunch, while  Trish quickly finishes writing in her band journal before shoving it back in her backpack and pulling out her much smaller meal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Sup Amigo” Reed says in between bites.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey Anon” Trish says meekly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even though it’s been a couple of weeks by now we still all aren’t the best of terms. At this point it’s mostly all water under the bridge, but Trish is still a shell of her former self. She seems confident at any moment when we’re all together we are going to turn on her. I try more for Fang’s sake than anything else to help bring Trish back out but so far nothings helped. That’s why Fang is so adamant that this little group hang sesh happen. Fuck was I mumbling again?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You always are Dork.” Fang says rolling her eyes before she takes a seat. “So with that wonderful introduction, you all know why we’re here. Things have been weird and the only way to get through that is to try and get back to normal. Hangout like we used to.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We hang out all the time though.” Trish pipes up</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah at school.” Reed responds chugging what he claims to be tea.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I think it’s a great idea. We should hang out more outside of school, I mean I don’t really know that many places here, but I’m sure we can find someplace to…” and that’s when I was cutoff by Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m so glad you agree Anon!” She says wrapping her arms around me. Everything about this starts alarms off in my head. Oh god wherever this is going it can’t be good. She would never try to butter me up unless…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“That’s why we’re going to do a movie marathon at your place Anon!” Fang says excitedly rubbing her hands down my chest as she holds me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The lizard brain responds immediately to all of this attention, but I’m brought back to reality by Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“A...Anons’ place?! In Skin rows?!” Trish almost shouts. Finally a spark of her old self returning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah I don’t know how good of an idea that is Fang.” Reed slowly drawls</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh come on. I’ve been there before it wasn’t that bad, plus Anon is the only one who lives by himself.” Fang says glancing back and forth between her two best friends. Suddenly her eyebrow raises  turning her face from one of stone cold seriousness to mischief.  “We won’t have to deal with anyone. No Parents, and more importantly no Naomi.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Both Trish and Reed visibly perk up upon hearing that. A chance to hang out without having to deal with her is a rare opportunity.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I mean” fang almost whispers into my ears “As long as that’s ok with you Anon…” as she says this she rests her head on my shoulder and rubs her face against mine. Again the lizard takes over and I shift my bag over the front of my pants.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah I mean my place is usually pretty quiet. We shouldn’t have anything to worry about.” I chuckle maybe more nervously than I wanted.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“YAY!” fang jumped up from her seat tail swinging side to side “So what movies should we marathon then?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The discussion lightened up as we began discussing what we should watch. We argued mostly playfully with a few flare ups now and again, but eventually we came to a decision. With that out of the way we moved onto the rest of the planning all uneventful until we got to how we were going to get the movies.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You can get them for us right Anon” Fang asks me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Steeling myself and gritting my teeth slightly “No I can’t if you recall I’m banned from the school internet for some reason.” it took all of my power to not glare at Trish as I say this. Before anyone else can speak trying to smooth over that incident I quickly add “But Reed is great with all that stuff like wires, and electronics. I’m sure he can do it.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed barely notices me roping him into this. Whatever he had taken clearly already affecting his system. “Whuzzat..?” he finally adds</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Reed you can download these for us can’t you” Fang asks almost too sweetly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah of course. Can’t see how that would be a problem.” he responds staring off into space.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Friday rolls around and another uneventful day of school crawls by. At this point few people even bother to try and make fun of me anymore, the school has already moved on to newer drama. Walking down towards the front of the school to meet with the rest of the gang I almost literally run into Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh heeey Anon. Man glad I found you. I have some uh…” he paused uncomfortably long lost in thought “business that needs to be taken care of.” He opens his bag and starts rooting through it. The clink of glass is heard as he digs, and was that a flash of metal? Are those Latex gloves?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey man no need to worry it’s all part of the business you know?” he says finally finding the object he wanted. He holds a usb out to me that I take and shove into my pocket. “It has all of the movies we discussed, with two versions of that one Trish wanted. Original audio and dubbed, but yeah tell the girls I’m sorry I have to ditch, but I’m sure they’re used to it by now.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Initially this worried me greatly. Did Fang set this whole thing up just to get us with Trish so we could work things out, or did Reed really have something come up. Thinking back to his last comment and the short time I’ve known him it didn’t seem that out of the realm of possibilities. I’m sure he’s forgotten to even show up to band practice. Still I couldn’t help but keep the thought in the back of my mind that this was a setup. Trish and Fang are standing in almost the exact spot where I first spotted them all those weeks ago. Little did I know then she would become the most important thing in my life. I guess that’s why I’m still going through with all of this I chuckle to myself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Come on Skinnie we’re waiting.”Trish says tapping her foot in impatience “And where is Reed?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh yeah I just ran into him. He said he had something he needed to take care of, and that he was going to have to bail.” I say reaching into my pocket, “but at least he gave me the movies so we can still do this. If y’all want to reschedule though that’s fine” I try not to sound too hopeful with that last part.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I mean if” Trish starts before being immediately cut off by Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Of course we’re still going to do it, right? Besides we already have everything and I’ve been looking forward to this all week!” Fang pleads.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish looks at Fang and then at me and shrugs “Alright fine, but how are we going to get there?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can’t believe we hadn’t actually thought of this before now. Fang nervously starts glancing at her phone, probably debating if she should even ask Naser. Now it’s my turn to step up for Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No worries I got a guy” I say walking down the stairs. As we reach the bottom I pull out my phone to make a familiar call, but already has pulled up and the window rolls down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You know the rule Kid. I can get you close but no further.” the cabbie says.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish and Fang both look at me quizzically, but I have already reached to open the door for them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“He’s cool I promise” and with this bit of encouragement the girls shuffle into the back. I slide in after them, and notice only after closing the door that Trish has the bitch seat. A seating arrangement that under normal circumstances would be uncomfortable now becomes awkward. As we speed off I start to speak up but before the words can form in my mouth mouth Trish beats me to it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang don’t you want to sit next to Anon?” she asks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You know the middle seat makes me sick Trish, besides it’s not that far of a ride you all can play nice for it. That’s the whole point of this remember?” she says turning her attention back outside.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It’s not like this is easy for me either Trigger. You’re the reason we’re in this situation to begin with. It was easier when you just hated me, instead of this awkward back and forth. As I finish this thought I see the cabbies eye shift from the rear view mirror back to the road. Shit…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah ‘shit’ is right you fucking ass!” Trish practically shouts in my ear. She stomps on my foot clearly pretending she was simply shifting her seating position “You think I’m excited about this? About spending god knows how many hours with you two lovebirds without even having Reed to talk to. What am I supposed to do? Sit alone and try to watch the shitty movie you picked out while you two make out?!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang ever the peacemaker now reaches a hand out and places it on Trish’s shoulder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Come on…” she pleads with Trish “It’s not going to be like that. That’s not what today was supposed to be about.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hmph.”Trish pouts. Not being able to look in either direction she simply stares down at her boots. “Fine, but we get to watch my movie first.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh yeah I forgot to mention. Reed downloaded both versions. Do you want subbed or dubbed Trish?” I ask her trying my best to sound sincere.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Subbed of course you fa..” her response is cut short as the cab slams on it breaks and turns 180 degrees to perfectly parallel park.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You know how it goes kid. No Further.” he says not even bothering to look back at us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Of course. I appreciate it.” I say exiting the vehicle and helping the girls out. Trish initially recoils at my hand but her boot gets stuck while she’s climbing out and has to use my arm to pull herself out. As she does she falls into my arms. Several emotions cross her face before she pushes away and starts dusting herself off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Thanks again” I say leaning into the open window to hand him his fair.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I drive people to their destinations. That’s who I am.” he says calmly before slamming his foot on the gas and peeling out from the spot perfectly into traffic.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So Skinnie how long do we have to go from here?” Trish’s mood seems to have perked up. Possibly due to impending violence she might get to inflict on some poor Skinnie who looks at her the wrong way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The walk to the apartment is completely uneventful. We basically saw no one at all. Trish seemed slightly upset by this, but didn’t mention it. Unlocking the door to my apartment Fang immediately makes herself at home and starts microwaving some nuggies and pulls out enough popcorn to feed an army. Trish awkwardly stands near the door, not even letting her bag touch the ground.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You can throw that bag anywhere” I say to her over my shoulder as I hook my rig up to the TV.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No that’s ok. I’d rather hold onto it. If that’s ok…” she looks at fang as she says this. A little odd, but I guess to her it’s as much Fang’s place as it is mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With everything setup I start the movie. We all squeeze onto my single bed, this time at least Fang sits between us a large bowl of popcorn in her lap. The nuggets it seems had simply been a snack to stave off her hanger while she organized the rest of the food. The movie Trish had picked out at first surprised me, one of those Japanese films everyone says you should watch but few ever do. Even more she wanted to watch it in Japanese. Mulling this over I realized how little I actually knew about Trish, Reed, and even Fang. I haven’t been around that long, and they’ve been friends forever. Suddenly I felt very self conscious about integrating myself into this long standing friend group. Had Trish been right in the cab? Was I really in it to be friends with them, or was it just Fang? This stream of thought was broken as a handful of popcorn smacks me in the face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I was worried about you two making out the whole time, but now I’m worried about you not shutting the fuck up Anon.” Trish says more playfully than I expected. Shoving another handful of popcorn in her mouth. She seems to be enjoying the look of confusion on my face. “Come on Anon it’s a movie night. Shhh…” raising a finger to her mouth to emphasize her shushing. Wait did she just lick the tip? No I’ve got to be imaging that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You do mumble a lot Dweeb.” Fang chides me wrapping her arms around my torso.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The movie continues but ever so slowly Fang seems to be getting herself more comfortable with me. Sliding her hand underneath my shirt to slowly stroke my chest. Eventually a hand rests itself on my crotch and give it a slow tender squeeze. She fought Trish about this, said this wasn’t what was going to happen but here she is making all of the advances. I don’t fight any of them, but I try not to engage with them. Was she testing me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eventually she stretches her wings out, and in doing so slides one behind me. Is that corny or what, but I don’t have anymore time to think about that scenario as I suddenly feel her wrapping her wings around me. Grabbing me by my shoulders she pulls me into a deep long kiss. I am momentarily panicked, how am I supposed to handle this. Eventually my body outpaces my mind and I return the kiss. Placing a hand on her waist and raising another to stroke her face and hair as I return the favor. Suddenly a new sensation appears. A hand on my crotch? Just as it happens Fang breaks away from me. Saliva still connecting us, she pushes me gently into the wall and turns to Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Now now… What did we discuss earlier Trish. No touching until you show him.” Fang says positioning herself on top of me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon… I…” Trish can barely spit these words out as she meekly reaches into her bag. She pulls out the notepad she’s always writing in. “Please…” she almost looks like she’s going to burst into tears as she says this “Please look at my stories…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“That wasn’t so hard was it Trish?” Fang says. She quickly hops off of me, much to the irritation of my confused but raging erection.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish hands over the notebook, and I awkwardly accept it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What am I supposed to do with this?” I ask.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang looks at me as she helps Trish off the bed “At least flip through it Anon. It would be Rude not to.” With that brief explanation she reaches down and starts to strip off Trish’s hoodie before pulling it back down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Now Anon no peeking, you’ve got your reading material.” She says smirking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Mind still reeling from what’s going on I decide I can at least pretend to look at the notebook. The moment I open it up I am confronted with a vast world of what Trish has dubbed “Erotic Friend Fiction.”  The first story appears to be about me… Cheating on Fang… With Stella? As if that would ever happen. A story about Trish helping me get my life together? Some of them seem rather plain, but then as it goes on they get much more erotic. With in depth descriptions about what Trish thinks sex with humans would be like, but more specifically sex with me. Suddenly a hand pulls the notebook away from me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I didn’t actually expect you to read them dweeb.” Fang says mockingly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I look up Fang and Trish are both standing there in almost matching lingerie. The only difference being the color. Fang’s a pure white and Trish’s a dark black. My mind can barely comprehend what’s going on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I… Uh… Huh… Awah…” I manage to blurt out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh Anon you’re so cute when your dumb.” Fang says crawling onto the bed. She beckons Trish over who starts to slowly strip me as Fang strokes my face with her hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Trish and I used to… Play with each other Anon.” Fang says nonchalantly “You had to guess that was at least a possibility, right? You’re not that dumb.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish takes my shirt off, and then heads down to my underwear. Fang takes this opportunity to gently bite my neck. My erection springs upward as Trish finally removes the last of my clothing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s so big…” Trish says eyeing my cock. With this she crawls on the other side of the bed and places a hand on my testicles. Slowly rolling them back and forth in her hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Trish and I had a conversation Anon.” Fang whispers in my ear. “And during our discussion I found out she wanted you almost as much as I do. Then I found her little smutbook.” while saying this you feel her tongue gently flick your ear. “Besides I’m not so jealous that I wouldn’t share you… especially with my best friend.” she begins kissing your chest</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You being friends would make me happy, Anon. You want to make me happy right?” she says stroking your chest with her hand. Her nails raking dangerously across your flesh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait was that the door?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey guys!” Reed says bursting through the doorway. “Turns out it didn’t take as long as…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">He stops dumbfounded by the situation. In his panic he closes the door with himself still inside. Once again he glances at us and then turns slamming his head into the door. Passing out onto the floor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“God Damnit Reed.” Trish sighs.</div>
