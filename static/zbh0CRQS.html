                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Final Goodbye</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Samantha, Ripley</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Anonymous</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There she was, your beloved daughter, little Lucy Aaran.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Your little angel, she looks as beautiful as ever. Truly head-to-toe magnificence. Always surprised you how long it took for her to find a suitor with looks like that, didn't it? Maybe you were a bit too rough on them after all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That long, silver hair of hers, shines so brilliantly whenever the sunlight hits it. It was done up nicely, like some extra care had been put into it for this special occasion.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That slight smirk she always carried, though the two of you didn't always saw eye to eye, it always made you smile when she was.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her wings... Bright, angelic, magnificent, just like her mother's. She's always kept them so well maintained.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She’s wearing that lovely white dress your wife had picked out for her. You remember her mentioning it as a prom dress, here it was being used once again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It feels... odd, seeing her off this early in her life. Always seemed like it’d take so much longer for her to finally reach that point.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Taking stock of herself and settling down never seemed like her thing, after all. Though, life is full of surprises.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just wasn't the kind of message you thought you'd get from her though. Never saw it coming at all, huh?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You think back on all the time you spent with her when she was little, all the fun games you used to play. Remember pirate princess? That was always her favorite.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All the trips and adventures the family went on. She and Naser always loved a good day at the beach.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even if you didn't like the music, you did always love seeing her band play. Even if her bandmates were a bit... different, they made her happy, and so did playing songs all day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She does have a wonderful singing voice, got it straight from her mother as well. Instruments seem to come to nartually to her, like they're her second language. Maybe she'll keep playing in the future.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She’s moving on now though, on to have her own adventures. She always wanted to go her own way, be her own person.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You wonder about where she’s going to go. She never really seemed to like Volcaldera that much anyway, other than her friends being here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ah well, guess that’s not really your decision to make. Every ptero has to leave the nest someday, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of course, it'll be such a treat to see her more in the future, to spend time with your little angel once again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You turn to your wife, she’s been at your side this entire time. She's lightly clutching your arm as she looks upon Lucy alongside you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Poor Samantha, she’s as emotional as you are about this, but she just can’t quite hide it like you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's bawling at this point, tears streaming down her face and onto the floor below as she weeps.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You’re a seasoned officer of the law after all, stoicism is in your blood at this point. Some of the stuff you've handled on duty has left you fully desensitized to emotional days like this, hasn't it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You draw her in closer, pressing her head lightly to your chest and placing a hand on the opposite side, gently holding her close.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You tell her things will be alright.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Little Lucy is just going her separate way from us, for now.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We’ll both see her again soon enough, someday.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With that, you look back to your daughter once again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You give her a slight smirk, and a nod to go with it. A solitary tear starting to roll down your cheek.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Take care of yourself, sweetie. I’ll be happy to see you again someday.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You'll always be dad's little angel, Lucy, I love you so much."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You usher Sam along, you two have taken up enough time, there are more people here to see her of course.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Besides, it’s time you go say goodbye to your son as well.</div>
