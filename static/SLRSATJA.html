Half an hour later, 4 dinosaurs and a human were cruising down the road in a beat up car</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon riding shotgun with Naser driving. Fang, Trish, and Reed managed to fit into the back</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A bit tight back there with all 3 of them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Unfortunately, Naser was surprisingly fast in picking everyone up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon thought for sure Naomi would sideline him for at least 15 minutes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang asks Anon if it's actually just some sort of prank. Her patience was wearing thin</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon reassures her that this is no prank</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon gives a knowing look to Naser, who confirms the plan is go</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A theatrical yawn later, Anon turns on the radio. Tunes always help a boring drive right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He dials it to a specific channel, a local channel</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang berates Anon. All that modern pop crap is not something she wants to listen to</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon tells her that he is absolutely certain that she will love the next song, and that he would bet her on it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Bet taken</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The radio hosts crackle in, their voices coming in just as they were announcing the conclusion of a contest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Any contest is easy to beat so long as you have thousands of people easily swayed by words online right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The hosts conclude that a local group has won their contest by an absolute landslide. They're not entirely sure where all those votes came from but the people have spoken</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They're not even certain how to pronounce the name though. Is it with a really long W or do you pronounce it like a German?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Give it up, for VVURM DRAMA!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Startled gasps of shock ring forth from the backseat</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"YOU GOT US ON THE RADIO!?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The speakers erupt with music recorded from their time at Moe's</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe low quality but that's why Anon labeled it as "Live"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Grey arms shoot out from behind Anon's seat and wrap around him in the crushing hug of an elated ptero as Fang's cries of absolute joy pierce through the car cabin</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon noted that for next time, he should consider ear plugs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh well, a bit of tinnitus is well worth what is going on now. At least Naser looks unaffected. Must be a ptero thing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon gives a glance at the back.
