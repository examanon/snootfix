You've got this!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I repeat the words in my head like a mantra, but it does nothing to ease my nerves.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Especially since I can barely hear my own thoughts amidst the overlapping chatter of my classmates.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Mrs. Prockling gave us the assignment to make a presentation about any form of entertainment from another culture. I found it the perfect opportunity to finally show my passion and love for anime.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wasn't even sure if this was a good idea… Especially considering how many times people have laughed at me, called me names, and treated me horribly because of it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Weeb, Weirdo, Nerd.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Each insult is just as painful as the last…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sage always told me, 'what doesn't kill you just makes you stronger.' She was right, though. This time it's going to be different. I know it will!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">…Will it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay, Listen Up!" calls out a voice that swiftly emerges from the opening door, revealing none other than our homeroom teacher, walking towards the desk that overlooked the classroom of distracted teens.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The Coelophysis woman addressed the class with barely disguised exhaustion.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I take it you all remember the drill." She groaned as she slumped into her chair. "We'll be doing presentations from those of you who volunteered to go first today and the rest tomorrow."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've been practicing all weekend, but I still can't feel a sense of dread. That feeling of the world around me becoming overwhelming large as I shrink. What if I mess up? What if they all laugh at me again?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">…No… They won't</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay! So we'll be starting in alphabetic order from last names, so…" Ms Prockling read aloud as she picked up the stray piece of paper from her desk, taking a moment to pause as she began to examine its contents.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stella Baudelaire! You're up first."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's when I began to feel the smallest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can feel a chill as I look around my peers, seeing all their eyes locked on me with varying expressions as their murmurs flood the classroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Some are looking at me with pity, disdain, and indifference, with very little of them possessing genuine curiosity on their face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Deep breaths, Stella. You've got this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I rise from my desk before I can even exhale and begin to make my way up to the presentation board, flash drive in hand...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay, Stella, just load up your presentation on the projector and start whenever you're ready."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ms. Prockling addressed me with a degree of concern in my eyes. She must have seen me start to get nervous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">…You're gonna do great… You're gonna do great…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A minute passes as I awkwardly begin to type away on the laptop in front of me, opening up Paraurpoint and making sure that the laptop's connected to the projector. I don't need any mistakes happening right now. A picture of the title screen appears before me as my finger leaves the keyboard for the last time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The Cultural Impact of Anime A Presentation by Stella Baudelaire Room 12A</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The words appear front and center in a green background with floral accents. Above the title is a picture of the Japanese flag, and a collection of some of my favorite anime characters on the side. Nagomi Yui, Chihiro Ogino, and Kirito specifically</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I see a giant replication of the title screen behind me on the projector as I turn around, confirming that everything is set up correctly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Paying no more attention to the potential ridicule of my classmates, I take a step away from the laptop, so everyone can get a better view.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">However, each step I take feels heavy, like I'm sinking into concrete, like my body is trying to stop me from moving no matter how hard I try.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I believe in you Stella…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"H-hello… everyone." I meekly address the classroom as I turn around to see well over a dozen people around my age, gazing in my direction, sporting various expressions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My stomach feels sick as I begin to hear the faint snickering from people in the classroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No… Ignore them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"S-so, for my presentation, I will be talking about anime…." The words struggled to form as the staring of my peers began to crush me with pressure.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can feel my legs wobble and my hands shake. But no matter how much focus I put into it, I can't keep it still. I need to push on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"A-anime is a form of entertainment from… Japan, it originated as an animated form of Manga. One of the earliest examples of anime was-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Can you stop dancing? You're in a classroom, not a talent show."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The stray comment emanating from a red ankylosaurus boy in the back corner causes chuckling from some of the students in the classroom, putting me off-guard and freezing me in place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey! Enough!" Ms. Prockling sits up and reprimands the heckler with a glare before turning to face me. "Please continue, Stella."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I… No… I.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh… Y-yes. One of the earliest examples of anime was the 1963 show Astro Boy… And since then, the genre took off, leading to the.."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can feel the judgemental look in their eyes all intensify, the sneers becoming more pronounced. It's only a matter of time before they start hurling insults at me again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...To the creation of studios such as Studio Ghibli, Bones, Mappa, and popular series such as Naruto, PreCure, and-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Amidst my swaying, I lose my balance and fall forward and the desk. Thankfully my hand catches on the desk, stopping my fall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just as I calm down, I start to hear the growing snickering throughout the class. I begin to see where precisely my hand was placed… And what slide i'm on now, a slide that I'm not supposed to be on until much later.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No… No, no, no! I must have skipped through all of the slides! Why is this happening? I practiced every day! So that something like this wouldn't happen!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"PPFFFTTTT HAHAHA!!! DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT RETARD FALL ON THE LAPTOP? A-AND IS THAT A FUCKING CATGIRL TOO??"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"CLEARLY, TWO BOMBS WEREN'T ENOUGH"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"DO A NARUTO RUN, YOU FUCKING WEEB!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Their insults overwhelmed me to the point where I can barely concentrate on the world around me as my eyes begin to swell up with tears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Aside from the white Pterodactyl girl in the back and the red Dilophosaurus closer to the front, almost everyone in the class is laughing at me</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">About how much of a loser I am, how pathetic I am.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't do this…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My legs kick into auto pilot as I run out of the classroom, as tears begin to flow from my eyes like waterfalls.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Pushing through the classroom door, I hear the angered voice of my teacher.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"THAT'S ENOUGH! ALL OF YOU!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The farther away I get from the classroom, the fainter her voice becomes, drowning out any comprehension of what she's saying next.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But I don't care what she's even saying, I just want to get out of here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Moving throughout the hallway, I pass by a handful of students, witnesses to see the anime-loving loser cry. They're looking at me with confusion, but I know what they're really thinking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Awww, did the stupid weeb get picked on again? Maybe she should do everyone a favor and just kill herself!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That girl must have no friends whatsoever aside from her body pillows and the weirdos in her Snootcord servers."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even if they don't say those words out loud, I can see it in their eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After aimlessly wandering the halls, I manage to find a spot away from all the chaos, one of the connected corridors that's usually abandoned at this time of the day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A place where I can be alone, where someone like me belongs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I crumple to the ground next to one of the lockers as the wave, no… A Tsunami of sadness washes over me…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why do people have to be so cruel? Anime has been such a big part life growing up. It's brought me so much joy in the darkest of days. Many days I came home from school crying because of the bullying I had to face, and I felt so alone, but whenever I got the chance to sit down and watch my favourite shows, I didn't feel so alone, if only briefly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm no stranger to being tormented for who I am. Even if there's been people who have shown me kindness like my Parents or Sage, it does little to dull the pain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So many kids my age can talk about how much they love superheroes, sports, video games, and books. But when I talk about how much anime means to me, I am treated like an outcast! It's a hobby like any other!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But… Maybe an aspie like me deserves this…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"¿Qué pasa? Why are you-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"MERDE!!" I jump backwards into the locker almost instinctually, causing a sharp pain to run down my back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">…why do I have to have back plates…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look towards the figure in front of me, an orange-coloured Ankylosauraus girl around my age, dressed in a rather beautiful floral dress. A concerned and apologetic look grows across my face due to her outburst.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Lo siento! I did not mean to scare you, I just saw you crying, and I wanted to ask if you were okay!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She appears to be genuinely concerned about my wellbeing, but why though? Why would this girl care about a loser she's never met before?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"My name is Rosa. What is your name?" The girl introduces herself as she lowers herself to the ground against one of the lockers beside me, facing me at eye level.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"S-Stella… My name is Stella…"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rosa responds with a warm smile "It's very nice to meet you Stella. Would I be able to ask why are you crying?" The concern returned to her voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I let out a sigh as her question reminded me of the abuse I faced from my classmates just moments ago.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I…. We had to do an assignment by presenting a form of entertainment from another culture to the class…" I force the words out of my mouth, my voice sounding a bit squeaky.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oooh, that sounds like a lot of fun! What was it you were presenting?" Rosa asked encouragingly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A wave of fear washes over me. If I tell her what I was presenting, she's just gonna laugh at me too…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I…I…"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey, hey, it's okay, Chica. You can tell me." She places a hand on my shoulder while looking me in the eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe, it's safe to tell her?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anime… I was presenting about anime… And… they.." My voice breaks as I struggle to continue, but Rosa's expression shows she knows what I'm about to say next.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Está bien! Listen…" Rosa interjects with a soothing, "You shouldn't ever have to be ashamed for the things you enjoy. In fact, I think anime is Muy Chula…pretty cool!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I light up for a brief moment. So many times have I felt alone due to how much of an outcast I feel like for being into anime or tarot readings. It's very rare to open up about my hobbies and not only not get judged for it, but rather have someone relate to it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You like anime too?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"¡Sí! I absolutely loved watching Dragon Ball Z when I was a Niña, but aside from that, I've seen a few other shows from time to time!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'll admit that Dragon Ball isn't exactly my cup of tea, but the fact to have someone other than Sage I can finally talk to about these kinds of things really makes me happy!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We spent the next few minutes discussing what else we liked to do. Turns out Rosa loves to garden and dance too, the first of which being something I've always wanted to get into! Her mood was slightly soured when I told her about my passion for astrology. I expected her to get up and leave at that moment, being left alone once more, but to my surprise, she didn't judge me for it! I'm assuming she must be a fairly religious girl since she mentioned something about "Raptor Jesus" having a plan for me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I began to feel more comfortable, I began to open up about how lonely I’ve felt since my first year, with Sage being my only real friend. My words caused a grim look to grow across Rosa’s face as if she can empathize with that sort of pain through first-hand experience.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We also just spent the time getting to know each other and what our experiences have been like at high school so fair, turns out she's a sophomore too! And before long, I almost forgot why I left the classroom in tears. I've always struggled with making friends, and just having someone to talk to like her really made me feel less… alone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stella Baudelaire, please return to Room 12A. That's Stella Baudelaire. Please return to Room 12A." The school's telecom echoes throughout the halls, pulling my attention away from my new friend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I take it they're looking for you?" Rosa glances at the speakers on the wall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah… I better go before I get in trouble."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No te preocupes! But before you go, I wanted to ask if you would like to sit with me at lunch?" Rosa rises from the ground as she offers me a hand for support.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Does she still want to hang out with me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You… want to have lunch with me?" I take her hand, her gesture of kindness confusing me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course! I had a great time talking with you, Stella! And I'd like to hang out again sometime." Rosa lets out a smile, genuinely taking an interest in me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I… I would love to! Thank you!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rosa lets out a chuckle. "Muy Bueno! I'll wait for you in the cafeteria when the bell rings!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I look forward to it, Rosa! I'll see you then!" Rosa and I begin to walk away from each other as we head our separate ways.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Adios, Stella! See you soon!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And from that point on, I made a friend that I would come to call my sister in time.</div>
