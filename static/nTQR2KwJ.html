The morning sun was determined to shine onto my closed eyes and force me to wake up. I finally give in and open my eyes. Slowly I get my bearings. A few birds are chirping outside, the open window is letting in a cool breeze, and instead of a blanket, I have a wing draped over my body. The warm Volcaldera summer made anything besides bed sheets pointless. Over the weeks it pretty much forced us to get rid of the bed cover and most of our clothes. Either that or you accepted you were waking up drenched with sweat. I was down to just a pair of boxer shorts, while Fang decided to get rid of everything entirely.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Taking a glance at the bedside alarm, I saw the digital face informing me it was a little over nine. The solar spotlight has made its way to Fang, causing her to start stirring. Beginning her own futile struggle, she buries her face into my sides while also pulling herself closer. Caressing her back I watch the sunlight creep ever closer to her face. A few minutes is all that it takes for nature to disturb Fangs' sleep once again. This time she accepts her fate and starts waking up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Blinking away the last few strands of sleep, she looks up to me with half-closed eyes, a smile creeping on her face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mornin'"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Morning, sleep well?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I could do with some more if it wasn't for this sun making it hard."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It is a quarter past nine"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang lets out a long groan as she tries to accept the fact that it's time to wake up. My hand made its way down to Fangs' tail. A light brush against it makes it wag rapidly for a few seconds. The ptero lets out a small giggle, before giving me a certain look.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I guess we have some time."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang pushes against the mattress, propelling her body on top of mine. Instead of the familiar feel of her soft scales, I only feel pain. Tears instantly start stinging my eyes and I let out a whimper.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh you big baby, you weren't whining last night."</div><div class="fanfic-line">As Fang adjusts her body I can't help but let out another sob. I can feel the elastic of my boxers stretching for a moment before abruptly snapping back. Can't help but wonder if this is some sort of fucked up nightmare my brain conjured up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As the sting from the elastic band slowly subsides I notice Fang is not on top of me anymore. Instead, I hear rummaging in the bathroom, followed by rapid footsteps. Fang rushes back into the bedroom holding a towel, an ice pack, and a tube of some sort of cream. She tosses what she's carrying onto the bed and proceeds to yank off my boxer shorts. I look up at her, seeing her more than a little worried.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What the hell happened Anon?! You look like you lost a fight with another bollard."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Propping myself against the mattress I look at what's causing Fang so much worry. Looking at my entire groin and pelvic area being covered in bruises made it obvious her concern was justified. Fang proceeds to wrap the ice pack in a towel before gently placing it on my bruises. Stinging at first, the radiating cold soon becomes a welcome relief. The ice pack doing its thing, Fang sits next to me on the bed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well? What do you have to say for yourself?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What? I didn't do anything. Not like I could with how exhausted I was."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang stares off into the distance, trying to figure out the reason for my unexplained bruising. Suddenly realization hits and her cheeks get a light dusting of pink.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, you don't think it was from..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As Fangs' face was getting redder by the second I glance down at my bruises and back to her a few times before finally figuring out what she's implying.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, it does seem the most likely explanation."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Suddenly Fangs' expression turns from embarrassment to anger. She smacks my chest with one hand just enough for it to sting a bit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why the fuck didn't you say anything if I was hurting you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">A smarter man would have picked his words more carefully at this point.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I mean, I wasn't exactly in pain then."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fangs' anger is washed away and replaced by a mixture of annoyance and some other emotion. I could have sworn I saw a smirk on her snoot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, I swear to god..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">As her voice trails off Fang removes the ice pack and starts applying cream to my battered body. The cooling effect and Fangs' gentle massage were doing wonders. Satisfied, the ptero leaves to put the ice pack back into the freezer. I pull up my boxers so I don't have to look at my battered groin longer than I have to. Trying my hardest to wrap my head around the whole situation, I don't make much progress before Fang returns. I can't help but notice she's laughing to herself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What's so funny?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sorry, I just can't believe you..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang can't finish her sentence before succumbing to the laughter she was desperately trying to suppress.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I know I shouldn't laugh. But after all that bragging that you'd make sure I couldn't walk straight," Fang wipes away a tear before continuing, "looks like that didn't go exactly as planned."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Laying on the bed I can only hope I sink into the mattress to escape the shame.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before the bed shows pity on me and swallows me whole, Fang grabs me by the hand and pulls me up into a sitting position.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on, let's get you something to eat."</div><div class="fanfic-line">I was expecting Fang to just help me stand up, but instead, she puts one hand under my knees and the other behind my back. As she lifts me up I can't help but let out a small yelp before grabbing onto her for fear of falling down. For her part, Fang isn't even exerting herself that much as she carries me to the living room. The time spent at the gym with Trish was already paying dividends. Gently lowering me down onto the couch I can't help but regret the bedroom and living room being so close together.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't worry, I'll take care of you, 'squishy'." Fang can't help but giggle as she sees a blush creep across my face. "Just so you know, I'm going to make you squirm one way or another." With a final flick of her tongue over the tip of my nose Fang makes her way to the kitchen, while I'm left wondering just how much worse the day will get. My body will heal, but the beating my ego is taking is an entirely different story.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The kitchen is suspiciously quiet, I lean as far back as the couch would let me to see what my ptero wife is up to. I saw she put on something to cover up her modesty, even if it was only her favorite apron with 'kiss the cook' embroidered onto it. Fang is leaning against the counter fiddling with her phone as something sizzles in the pan she has on the stove. Surely she isn't texting anyone about what happened. My fears prove to be without merit as within seconds a song starts playing from her phone's speaker and she puts it down on the counter. Fang turns her attention back to the stove, her tail wagging to the beat of the song. Sensing she's being watched Fang turns around, locking eyes with me. It lasts only for a moment, but she knew I was staring at her. She gives me a smile and a quick shake of her rump before returning to her task.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">While I spend several minutes cursing my weak body, Fang brings breakfast for both of us. Like a doting housewife, she lays the plate before me, a pair of sunny-side-up eggs with some dino nuggets forming a makeshift smile and nose, along with a glass of orange juice. Moments later she throws herself onto the couch, one leg on top of the back of the couch, the other dangling freely. Surprisingly, she's still wearing the apron. I start eating breakfast before Fang figures out what exactly I'm drooling over. Fang is eating her own egg/nugget combo, although with far less gusto than usual. She gives me a worried look.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, are you sure you're OK? Maybe we should go to a doctor after you finish eating."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's just a few bruises, I've lived through worse. You should know, with being there and all." Fangs' worried expression persisted. "I'm fine. Besides, the only thing the doctor will do is give me a thumbs up when he sees where my bruises are and who my wife is." Finally, her worry melts away from the rising heat in her cheeks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, you ass..." is all she could say as she picks up the dirty dishes and heads to the kitchen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Since there isn't anything useful I can do today, I decide to pick up my xrox controller for a few rounds of rock ring. Fang returns before the console even finishes its long bootup sequence. Ditching her apron, she's back in her birthday suit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The ptero sits down next to me and I can't help but ask, "So, uh, no clothes today?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nah," before I can continue Fang snatches the controller out of my hands, "Too sick for sex, too sick for video games."</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm about to protest about her definition of sick, but my attention is pulled to the screen. Instead of shutting off the console, Fang is selecting a game to play.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So, you're going to play?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sure, why not?" Fang makes herself comfortable in the corner of the couch, her wings draped over the back of it, "Used to play this one with Naser way back when." The title 'Rock Ring: Clubbing Evolved' fills the screen and the menu music fills me with nostalgia. I scoot closer to Fang as she makes her way through the menu. I put my arms around her waist, and for a moment think about resting my head on her boob, before choosing her shoulder instead. As much as I wanted to, it would have ruined the moment. Fang for her part remains focused on the game, but eventually brings down one of her wings as a makeshift blanket. Man, this is comfy as shit, no wonder Fang watches me play all the time. We stay like this for a good while, with Fang swatting my hand if it wanders too close to her nether region.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Which makes me wonder, "Sweet tooth, you feeling OK?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">For just a moment she is embarrassed by the pet name before replying, "Sure, why wouldn't I be?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I mean, aren't you even a little bit, "I pause to clear my throat, not exactly sure how to say this, "You know, sore?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang pauses the game and stands up, leaving me without my ptero blanket and cushion. Moving exaggeratedly, she 'examines" herself by nearly showing her crotch in my face several times.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I feel fine." She takes a step back and does a standing split right then and there. "Nope, nothing hurts. Must be those extraordinary genes doctors keep telling me about."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You're enjoying this, aren't you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What was that, squishy?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"N-nothing. Think you can get me another ice pack?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course, but first we have to take you back to bed."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Same as the last time, Fang picks me up and carries me to the bed. Although this time her pace is somewhat slower, and she wraps her wings around me as she carries me. The way she lowered me down and applied the cream again was beyond gentle. Hopefully, she isn't still blaming herself for what happened. Satisfied with her work, Fang momentarily leaves the bedroom. After pulling my boxers back on, but before I pull myself up to the pillow, Fang returns with a guitar. She gets on the bed so that her back is against the headboard. Fang begins playing a song, but from the missed notes, it's clear something is bothering her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What's wrong?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Just thinking," Fang lets out a sigh, "You know I'd never intentionally hurt you, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course," I scoot closer to her, "It's just a few bruises, they'll be gone before you know it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, but if you got bruised this easily, how are you going to survive estrus week?" Fang puts the guitar down before continuing. "I'm just worried I won't be able to restrain myself and you'll end up with more than just a few bruises." I'm trying to think of a way to console her, but the fact that last night was supposed to be her exercising restraint gets stuck in my head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That was restraint?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mmhmm. I really want to spend the entire estrus week with you, but not if I put you in a hospital." She lets out a deep breath, "I also don't want to spend the entire week locked in my room again."</div><div class="fanfic-line">I grab her hand to make her snap out of it, "Hey, don't worry, we'll figure something out." I give her a light squeeze which does make Fang smile a little bit. "Besides, I'm not getting hospitalized over a few bruises."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, it's not just bruising. It's bites, scratches, dehydration, extreme exhaustion, and so on."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Now you're just messing with me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang gives me an annoyed look, "Why do you think you get two weeks off if your wife's estrus only lasts one week?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hadn't considered that. Still, last night was restraint?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang suddenly grabs her phone, "I'll call Naser, maybe he knows of some drug to help you out."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wait, what? Why your brother?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why not? He graduated top of his class, if anyone knows his shit it's him."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But, does he really need to know about what happened?</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't worry, I'll try to keep it sparse with the details. Then again I might have to, he is kind of dense sometimes."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang selects the dial command, puts the call on speaker, and tosses the phone on the bed between us. As we listen to the dial tone, Fang hugs her knees and brings them up to her chest. Finally, Naser picks up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fang? What's up?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang does her best to sound casual but completely fails at the attempt, "Hey Steven Fucked-wing. Got a minute?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh, sure. What's up?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well...", unable to explain how she turned the area around my dick into the color of a blueberry Fang starts waving her arms at me to come up with something. Before I can even begin thinking of any euphemism, Naser speaks up, clearly worried.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh god, are you OK, Fang? Did something happen?" Nasers voice changes from worried, to panicked, to angry in a single second. "Did Anon hurt you? I swear to raptor Jesus if he laid a finger on you I'll..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang interjects before Naser can continue spelling out what he'd do to me if I ever harmed his sister.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stop freaking out dipshit! I'm perfectly fine." Still unable to spell it out for Naser, Fang continues, "It's Anon."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fang, what did you do?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I got a bit carried away and..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fang, is my brother-in-law OK?</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Jesus fuck, he's fine. Why do you keep jumping to conclusions?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">There is a short pause, during which I can only imagine Naser pinching the bridge of his snoot in frustration.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry. It's just the way you're dancing around whatever the fuck is going on, it's not like you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang looks at me, "I'm gonna tell him."</div><div class="fanfic-line">I put on my best begging face, "Fang. Please."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Listen one-winged wonder, anons crotch is all bruised from, uh, late-night wrestling." Fang just looks down at the bed, hoping to get through the awkwardness as fast as possible. "I'm really worried he won't make it through estrus week without a trip to the ER. You got any pills or shit that can help him out?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">There is no response for several seconds. The call is still active and I can't help but let out a groan. Fang is starting to get worried she caused her brother to die from cringe.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Naser?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I didn't need to know that sis," Naser lets out a long, frustrated sigh, "Was it too hard to call your doctor or something? I really don't need to know how hard you two go at it. God damn."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Deal with it. Now spit out what the pills are called before I start going into excruciating detail on how I rock my husband's world."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Good god, I hope she's bluffing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How the fuck should I know? I'm not that kind of doctor. Just tell the pharmacist you need something for a human to survive estrus week. Ask for max strength."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hope returned to Fang. Finally, she'll be able to fuck my brains out without sending me to an early grave.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Look, if there's nothing else I'm gonna hang up, and hopefully forget this conversation ever happened."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Bye, Harwing De-," Naser hangs up before Fang can finish saying one of the oh-so-many nicknames she has for her brother.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look up at Fang who is finally calm again, "So, what now?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nothing, the pharmacy is closed until Monday."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I mean, what do you want to do next."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well," Fang flops down on the tummy, her face next to mine, "I can continue teasing you like I've done the whole day." I do love it when she does that, but usually, I can act on my desires when she does that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Or we can just cuddle for a bit. Your choice." I put my hands around my ptero wife and pull her close.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Cuddling it is. But you're the little spoon again." Fang twists me around so she's pressed against my back and rests her snoot against my face. Unsurprisingly her hands travel down south forcing me to let out a hissing noise when she reaches a particularly painful bruise.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fine, we'll stick to cuddling: classic for a while. Gonna have to wait for the deluxe version to come back into stock."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div>
