Your precious daughter squeaks as she sprints to meet you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You've barely got time to throw your arms wide before the little girl leaps into them with all her might</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even as small as she is the force manages to knock you back a step</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Good to see you too, sweet tooth." you grin as you hold her up higher, planting a smooch on her cheek</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your daughter squeals happily and squirms in your grip</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"daddy, look!" She finally wriggles free, bouncing up and down as she tilts her head and points to her snout</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The iconic fang she inherited from her mother is gone, her long tongue flicking through the gap in her teeth to show it off</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Wow! Looks like somebody is gonna get a pretty penny from the tooth ptero tonight!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The stars in her eyes are precious, you'll miss moments like this</div><div class="fanfic-line">>'Guess that makes you just Amber now, huh?" you chuckle as you ruffle her hair</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Nuh-uh! Now I'm toothless!" she emphasizes the name by poking her tongue through the hole yet again</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She's starting to look like a lizard doing that</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Well stop poking at it!" You chide her, bopping her gently on the snout</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ever dramatic she tumbles all the way back, somersaulting head over heels</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Blegh!" She grunts, splaying her arms and legs wide</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You give her a few moments but she seems quite committed to the act</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh no, I've killed Amber. Guess she'll miss her music lesson"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You can't help but grin as the tiny ptero immediately sits back up with a gasp of horror</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I'm fine! Look, see!" She shoots to her feet, running in circles to prove just how fine she is</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It's a miracle." You shake your head, smiling despite yourself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Why don't you do daddy a favor and go get the instruments?" You gesture towards the living room</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Amber briefly salutes before sprinting off, her one good wing flapping for speed</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The smaller stub of the other wing was putting a valiant effort in as well, you asked her every day if it hurt but she didn't seem to mind</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With a groan you reached deep within yourself, digging for the reserves of energy that fatherhood seemed to grant</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was all for Amber after all</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You stepped into the living room, your little girl already had a tiny ukelele in her hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Next to her was a slightly larger ukelele</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You still felt silly picking up the small instrument but Amber was too young to care how you looked</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You reached over to a nearby desk and grabbed some papers printed out earlier</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Truth is, these were your lessons just as much as hers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Staring at the confusing sheets you regretted being unable to hire a tutor once again</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Doing your best to appear like you had any idea what you were doing the lesson began in earnest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>An hour later the aches of your body had moved to your head, you didn't understand this nonsense at all</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Music was never your talent, it was hers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You look across the room to a framed photo</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The last one taken before the accident</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even from here you could see that smile Lucy wore, the love in her eyes as each of you held one of Amber's hands</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You returned to the instrument with new vigor, if you closed your own eyes it almost felt like her hand was guiding yours along the strings</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Just like she did all those years ago</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You still remember the last thing your wife ever said to you, how could you forget?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her last words as you held her broken body, wailing that you couldn't go on without her, begging Lucy to hold on just a little longer</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Don't cry" was all she asked</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This wasn't the first time you disappointed her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You didn't even notice that Amber stopped playing until you felt tiny arms wrap around your waist</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She looked up at you with those large amber eyes that were her namesake</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her eyes, her gray-blue feathers, even the little snout poking into your side</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You sniffled, wrapping an arm around the girl and hugging her tight</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Don't cry, daddy" she pleaded, voice muffled against your shirt</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A small, sad smile tugged at your lips</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In a way, Lucy never left</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You're sure you don't mind?" You ask for what must be the tenth time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yes, anon. I'm sure I don't mind taking care of my niece for one night" Naser replied, taking the bag of babysitting supplies from you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Okay, just remember she likes her sandwiches cut into triangles"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I remember, you've told me three times" he sighs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"And bedtime by nine!" You remind him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Bedtime by nine" He repeats, rolling his eyes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"But if she-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Anon!" Naser interrupts you, his talon grasping your shoulder</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Everything's going to be fine, go enjoy your night"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He smiles reassuringly, you look over his shoulder and see Amber already pestering Olivia</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She's crawled into her lap, a wide grin on her face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Olivia reaches into a bag on her wheelchair and pulls out some goggles, placing them loosely over Amber's face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With a push of her arms the two of them are off at surprising speed, your daughter cheering all the while</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Relax, Anon. We can handle it" Naser says, shaking your shoulder to get your attention</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You nod, hesitantly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Once you do, you're caught by surprise as he pulls you in for a hug</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You should visit more too. You're still family." Naser admonishes you once he pulls away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's hard not to let the smile creep on your face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Sure thing, so when are you and Olivia finally going to have a kid of your own?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your brother-in-law shakes his head in disbelief</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Anon, get the fuck out of here"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You hope he can still hear you cackling on the way back to your car</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naser was a good guy, you trusted him with your daughter more than anyone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Still, as you start up the car and begin driving to the restaurant your good mood quickly fades</div><div class="fanfic-line">>How did Rosa manage to convince you to do this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It had been years since the accident that left you and Amber with only each other</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You didn't feel like you had moved on, You're not certain you ever would</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But Rosa had been coaxing you on this for a while</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was always so earnest, so passionate in her desire to help others that she managed to make you feel guilty for shutting down her attempts at matchmaker</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Eventually she ground you down but truth be told, Rosa didn't truly convince you of anything</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Lucy wouldn't want you to be alone for the rest of your life, You helped coax her out of the shell she hid away in and enjoy the life she was too afraid to live</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She wouldn't want you to follow in her footsteps</div><div class="fanfic-line">>So here you were, parked outside a mundane restaurant, tugging at the wine-stained sleeves of your old tuxedo</div><div class="fanfic-line">>On a blind date</div><div class="fanfic-line">>According to Rosa you and your mysterious date were just perfect for each other</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You already lost the woman that was perfect for you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You shake your head to clear your thoughts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now's not the time for that kind of thinking, it wasn't fair to whoever this woman was</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Besides, you were supposed to enjoy yourself tonight</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With a deep breath you pop open the door to the car and head inside</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You suddenly feel very overdressed, everyone here is in casual clothes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Most are with their family</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Here you are, alone, in a shitty tux</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At least the waiter doesn't pay you a second glance, taking you to your seat</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You check your phone, still a little early for your date</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That didn't do much to help your nerves, it felt like every eye in the restaurant was judging you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You're fairly certain they weren't but that knowledge didn't change how you felt</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe just a little shitposting? You've barely visited your old home since you got married</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For old times sake then</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If nothing else it's a good distraction</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Twiddling with your phone you hardly notice that someone's walked up to your table</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Ahem, is this seat taken?" A dusky, feminine voice caught your attention</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking down as you were, your eyes had to travel all the way up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At least she was in rather formal clothes herself, a professional, modest length black skirt led into a prim jacket and dress shirt</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Gold jewelry dangled on either side of her face, framing surprisingly luscious lips</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking into her amethyst eyes you caught a hint of recognition</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You're certain that yours were much the same</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The two of you stared at one another as the realization finally set in</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Anon!?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Trish!?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The moment lasts for a few heartbeats before a rising chuckle escapes you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You didn't say it aloud but you were privately relieved, it was just Trish, thank Raptor Jesus</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish apparently found your laughter infectious, she tried to stifle her giggle with a hand to no avail</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So you're supposed to be the skinnie of my dreams, huh?" She sounded amused as she sat down across from me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Rosa got to you too?" You remarked, feeling much more at ease now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I keep telling her I'm too busy to date but she just won't hear anything of it! I'm mostly here just to get her off my back!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You could feel an eyebrow raise unbidden, she said that a little too quickly. Was she nervous?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ultimately whatever Trish had going on wasn't your concern</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That's not to say the two of you weren't friends, of a sort</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You still hadn't forgotten the hand that Trish had in scarring Lucy, how obsessive and controlling she was</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But that was so many years ago, you tried not to hold it against her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It took a lot for Lucy to feel confident enough talking to Trish again, they made amends at your insistence but the friendship of their past was long gone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For years Trish had been little more than a purple face on your snootbook friend's list</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The most interaction you got with her was kind comments on images uploaded</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And condolences after the accident</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I'm surprised to see you on a blind date"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her voice pulls you from your thoughts, she's looking at your hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your wedding ring still rests there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You cover it with your other hand, chuckling nervously</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Just, you know... Getting out there. Rosa's been pestering me about it"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish cleared her throat, brushing her hair to the side</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You stared down at the table for a short while, the mood slowly souring</div><div class="fanfic-line">>So much for a good night</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You're about to apologize when Trish interrupts you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It's fine, Anon. I... Can't say I understand what you're going through but this doesn't need to be anything more than two friends sharing dinner"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Huh, that was a surprisingly mature thing of her to say</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You reach your hand across the table</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"As friends then" you state with a small smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As friends" She repeats, taking your hand and giving it a single firm shake</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She's got quite the grip for such a small woman, your hand practically dwarfs hers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That defused the tension somewhat, the waiter returning to take your orders helped as well</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"At least I'm not the only dork in here" You mention casually, watching the waiter leave</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Excuse me?" Trish scoffed</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You gesture to her attire, then yours</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"We're a little overdressed don't you think?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I'll have you know this is my casual attire!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You give her another once over, there is absolutely no way she was comfortable in that clothing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"And the gaudy jewelry?" You ask</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish rears back somewhat, that very same jewelry clattering with the motion</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She looks like she wants to argue with you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Eventually she just sighs, leaning forward and rubbing her temples</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Alright, you caught me. I haven't exactly done much dating"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah, me neither" You agree</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish snorts out a laugh before immediately covering her mouth in horror</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She looks up, afraid that she might have offended you before she notices your smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You don't need to be so worked up Trish, at least for tonight we're both dorks" you reassure her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The change is almost imperceptible, her shoulders slacken slightly, her head tilts, the curl of her tail loosens</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You hadn't even noticed but now it was obvious, this was the first time that Trish had let herself relax for the night</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah, I guess we are." She agreed, her voice so soft it was nearly lost to the ambient noise of the diner</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The rest of your evening was spent getting to know a side of Trish you never expected to see</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You're certain that the volume of wine both of you kept putting away played no small role in it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Chatting with Trish it was easy to see how Lucy and her had become such strong friends</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish was passionate, incredibly so, in nearly everything she did</div><div class="fanfic-line">>More than that, when she talked of her friends and co-workers she sounded almost maternal in how protective she was of them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In how much she pushed them to do their very best, to be as passionate as Trish herself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even after the food was long gone the two you stayed and talked</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Currently you were venting some frustrations much to Trish's amusement</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So there I am, with Amber looking up at me, waiting, and I'm staring at this hemidemisemiquaver bullshit on the page and I don't know what the fuck to do! So I just pluck a few notes that sound close enough and she buys it, thank god."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Ha!" Trish's snort cuts off any further laughter, maybe it was the alcohol talking but you were starting to find it cute</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You take a deep breath after your rant, downing what little wine was left to wet your lips</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You know, Anon..." Trish was smiling to herself as she traced the rim of a wineglass with her finger</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I could be Amber's tutor, it's not like I've forgotten how to play" she remarked, looking up at you with a coy smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's lucky that you had drained your glass because you probably would have spit it out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"That's great! I-I mean.. It would be great but I just can't afford a tutor" you stammer</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Free of charge! From what you told me I think you've paid enough trying to teach her yourself"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You clearly looked as surprised as you felt because Trish started chuckling when she saw your expression</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Are you sure I can't compensate you in some way? That's a lot of time" you persist, your pride as a man was on the line after all</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish hums to herself but she's obviously just pretending to be lost in thought</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Well I don't know. I suppose I had fun tonight, maybe you could take me out again?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That coy smile of hers returned</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"As... Friends?" you ask uncertainly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"As friends" She repeats for the second time tonight</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As soon as you nod, Trish squeals girlishly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It's settled then, I'm so excited to meet little Amber!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You believed it, her coy smile had widened into something more earnest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Despite that you still felt a bit nervous, unconsciously stroking the cool metal band around your ring finger</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was fine so long as you were just friends right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You caught Trish's gaze, her smile had reached all the way to her eyes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was shockingly easy to lose yourself in those purple prisms</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yep, just friends</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In the months that followed Trish had become something of a common occurrence in your household</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She sort of had to be for Amber's music lessons after all</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Of which you were very grateful, in no small part because you no longer had to suffer the headache</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was incredible just how quickly Amber's talent grew with a proper teacher</div><div class="fanfic-line">>More than that though, you couldn't really afford to go out every week with Trish for her "payment"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She didn't seem to mind that much, instead the two you simply stayed inside</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sometimes you watched movies</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sometimes you cooked her dinner</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sometimes she was your tutor as well, you still wanted to learn after all</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was with no small embarrassment to realize that Amber was a better student than you were</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Guess she just had music in her blood</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Occasionally, you caught Trish staring at pictures of Lucy when she thought you wouldn't notice</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Regardless of how rocky their relationship may have ended up, Trish still seemed to care for her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Or maybe she was just looking at photo's of the two of you together</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The thought left guilt roiling within your stomach</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You weren't the same oblivious kid from high school anymore</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You knew exactly what Trish wanted</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You were incredibly grateful that she hadn't forced the issue so far</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That she respected you just weren't ready yet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The thump of a refrigerator door closing snaps you awake</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You hadn't even realized you were dozing off, lost in your thoughts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's not like work had gotten any less exhausting either</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was movie night and unfortunately your daughter was one of those girls who watched the same god damned movie 15 times yet never got bored</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Amber shifted in your lap, clearly excited</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish rounded the corner into the living room, a plate in her hands</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her loose curls were bouncing as she stepped over to us, she left her oversized hoodie unzipped to reveal a baggy shirt beneath</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She even had sweatpants on to complete the 'basically pajama's but technically clothes' look</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was quite a stark contrast from your blind date</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She held out the plate for Amber, the sandwiches were cut into triangles of course</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Mmm! Thanks Miss Trish! You make the best sammiches!" Amber chirps as she slides the entire thing into her mouth</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She really liked to eat her sandwich in one bite, apparently, you always cut them too big or too small</div><div class="fanfic-line">>To complete her betrayal, Amber hopped from your lap to Trish's once she sat down</div><div class="fanfic-line">>According to Amber, Trish was just more comfortable</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You're pretty sure that's 7 year old for "Trish has big pillowy breasts to rest against"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The thought makes you a little concerned for her future</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You wanted grand-children, damn it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With dread you reach for the remote and hit the play button</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You really wish Amber would listen to the song she loves so much and actually let it go</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish apparently noticed the tired in your eyes that sleep won't fix</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Unfortunately, she was shushed by Amber before she could distract you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You're fairly certain the girl could recite this movie by memory at this point</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh great, here comes the song</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You sang with Amber the first time you watched this movie</div><div class="fanfic-line">>According to your daughter, this meant you had to sing it with her every time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish chuckled once the two of you began</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Then to your surprise, and Ambers delight, she actually joined in as well</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Having a new voice in our chorus was unique, Trish definitely put her all into it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not that she was any better singer than either your or Amber</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Still, once it was over you shot her a thankful smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Couldn't do much without risking Ambers wrath over missing a single word</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking at your daughter and... Best friend?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yep, best friend</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The two of them together paint quite a picture, Amber is practically curled up like a cat in her lap</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish wrapped her arms around the little girl, treating her oversized jacket like a blanket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Amber yawns, stretching as much as her seat will allow</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You can't stifle the giggle when Amber's wing bops her on the snout</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Worse, the feathers have started tickling her nose</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish does her best not to sneeze, you've definitely been in that position before</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's a losing battle, her face is screwed up with the attempt</div><div class="fanfic-line">>once she took the customary two breaths you knew it was over</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Chu!" Trish practically squeaked</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That was the tiniest, girliest, most pathetic sneeze you've ever heard</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And absolutely not what you expected</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You had to bite the inside of your cheek to keep from laughing out loud</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The death glare Trish sent you wasn't exactly intimidating either with your adorable daughter in her arms</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Miss Trish, can I ask you a question?" Amber spoke up before either of you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She sounded halfway asleep already, in fact, her eyes remained closed when she asked</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Of course you can, sweet tooth" Trish looked down at the girl in her arms with a small smile on her lips</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was a smile you quickly adopted looking at her brand new fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Are you my new mommy?" Amber asked innocently, nuzzling herself further against Trish</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your smile dropped immediately</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish froze on the spot, utterly shocked</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her mouth worked as she tried to come up with an answer before she turned her wide eyes on you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What was she doing that for!?
