                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Daddy's Special Girl</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Olivia, Mark</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Anonyous</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It’s a sunny and beautiful Saturday morning in Volcaldera; I’m just finishing up making breakfast for me and my daughter. Nothing too fancy, just a plate full of miniature waffles, though this monkey shape waffle iron adds a bit of zest for a young girl like her. I plate them up and split them fifty-fifty even if she won’t eat as much as I will; along with that I make sure to grab the various syrups we have in the cupboard so she can combine them into whatever flavor profile she desires. Along with that I make sure to go ahead and pour out a glass of orange juice for both of us, gotta make sure she gets her vitamin c.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I set the plates and assorted meal accoutrements on a tray and head off to the living room where she was surely waiting for me. Heading on in I spot her sitting patiently on the couch. She was mostly distracted from the time by watching cartoons, the same Saturday morning action stuff I used to watch as a kid. I thought it was kind of a miracle, a channel that ran a block of stuff like: “He-Dino and the Masters of the Universe”, “TMNT”, “Thundersabers” and the like; but I'm happy I get to share the kind of childhood with her that I had.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Gently I set down the tray on a wooden TV tray stand I had bought for her a while back, resulting in a beaming smile from her as she turns to me and exclaims, “Thanks dad!” before coating her coating her waffles in a mix of syrup flavors before digging in with gusto. I smile over to her, lightly ruffling her hair around as she starts to eat, “Anytime, princess, let me know if you need anything else alright?” She gives me an energetic nod before returning to her plate and the cartoons on the screen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I relax back into the cushions of the couch, picking away at the waffles I left for myself as she dug in. Situations like this just reminded me of similar days with my old man, family breakfast and early morning cartoons with him. In between glances over at her as she dug in, I focused mostly on the episode of He-Dino that was playing. I had seen it countless times in my life but of course each episode was a brand-new experience to her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Clearly she had a bigger appetite than expected, I was still picking away at my plate as she swiped one of my waffles. I turn to look at her. She beamed back one of the widest smiles I had ever seen while also sticking her tongue out at me like the adorable child she was. I immediately concede the waffle to her with a chuckle, finishing off the one she had left me with as we both kept watching the show.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With time breakfast had ended, leaving the two of us there just relaxing on the couch together and watching the television. She was leaned right up against my side with my arm wrapped ever so gently around her and holding her close to me. Her cute little voice piped up to me with something surprising, “Dad, some of the kids at school have been making fun of me...” I could tell by the change in her tone that it wasn’t just a bit of teasing, that she was dealing with something serious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Awe, what are they making fun of you for dear? You can always tell me what’s wrong.” I gently bring my hand up to stroke the top of her head, again messing with her hair as I look down at her eye to eye.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She tears up a bit, only dropping my smile further before she continued, “They say I’m funny because of my wheelchair, they say I’m broken...” I freeze up momentarily as she looks up with me with sadness in her eyes, a tear nearly escaping my own as I grab her and pull her up into my lap and hold her close to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Olivia, baby. You’re not broken, you’re a special, beautiful young girl. Don’t let anyone ever tell you otherwise.” I tuck her head into my chest gently stroking the top of her head as both of us equally try to fight back tears. “They just haven’t met a girl like you before so it’s something new for them. There’s not a thing in the world wrong with you, I promise you that.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Over time her sniffling and nuzzling into my chest subsided. She turned her head up to face me again, I look right back down into those beautiful eyes of hers as a solitary tear glides down my cheek. My hand once again glides down the top of her head to her back as she poses me a question, “Will you show me how to walk, dad?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I give her a warm smile before a soft smooch on the forehead, “Sure sweety, I’ll walk with you, watch here.” I spin her around in my lap before standing up, holding her by her small and soft hands as I lean down to just the point that her feet touch the ground. As they sat flush to the floor, I slowly backed my feet to right behind hers and posed her the question as my smile grew wider, “Are you ready to walk, sweety?” Her response was giggling and an enthusiastic “Yeah!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I lean my left foot forward, pushing hers along with it as I took her arm with to try to help her rotate her hip, it wasn’t a perfect step by any imagination, but any step to her meant the world. Then I repeated the same with my right, then the left again, before long Olivia and I were ‘walking’ around the living room at a decent pace. We did laps around the couch together, all the while I could hear her giggling and laughing gleefully, and passing in front of a mirror I could see the sheer elation on her face as she got to experience this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I couldn’t keep this up forever though, leaning over like this was doing a number on my back. I reach down further and grab her by the sides, lifting my little daughter high into the air as her laughing grew louder and louder. I head back on over to the couch with her in my arms, flumping back into the cushions as I hold Olivia tight to me and give her a soft peck right on the cheek.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Just remember dear, if those kids try to make fun of them again you just tell them that there’s nothing wrong with you, daddy says you’re special.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Is special a bad thing, daddy?” She looks up at me once more, she didn’t seem sad any more, just seemed to be posing a simple question.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Not at all Olivia, being special is just what makes you, you. It’s what makes you so beautiful, so unique, being special will never be a bad thing, I promise.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She shoots me back up a confident smile before replying back, “I’ll tell them all my dad said that I’m a special girl! That there’s nothing wrong with me like they say there is!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another tear drips down my cheek as I smile at her, once again pulling my beloved daughter into a tight embrace as a deep sigh escapes me, “You’re the strongest and toughest little girl in the world, Olivia. I love you so much...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I love you too, dad!”</div>
