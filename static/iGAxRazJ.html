                <div class="fanfic-text">
                    <div class="fanfic-line">Contains depictions of gore, frequent language, emotional trauma + bonding, and a shitty combination of shits, giggles and feels. Jarvis, turn off all Gosling inhibitors.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Chapter 1</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The spring breeze coming from the alleyway on the right had only improved Anon's already good mood, as the double date he was just on had ended in the highest note possible. He and Fang had just nabbed a venue, and a great starting one at that. Not only was it at a popular Pizzeria, it was also at Fang's uncle Moe's Pizzeria. The guy looked so happy to see his niece with a new friend and asking to perform at his restaurant. However, thinking back on it, Anon had just felt something click in the deepest part of his brain. The almost wicked smile, the body language, the accent, the heavy concern of family, it had all just hit Anon like a V8 truck slamming into him. "Moe" wasn't just a happy face; He had to have been a part of some sort of crime organization. The conversation with him had felt all too familiar, and Anon was not about to let that part of his life come rushing back to him, especially with his friends around. He had already had so many people break ties with him out of fear of association, and he couldn't let that happen again. These three silly meteor dodgers had given him the first feeling of friendship he's had in a very long time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was getting late. Black darkness had already shrouded over the town. As the four had approached the NasCar, Anon had a sudden light-bulb appear above his head. He's already impressed Fang, but he could do even better. He could impress EVERYBODY. Years of living in high stakes had given Anon the driving skill of a Rally professional. If Skin Row could give anyone anything of value it was Psychological strength and survival skills. Having escaped many "deals" gone wrong, Anon had mastered the art of driving, and he was going to wow everyone in the Charger Hellcat. Though, he wasn't about to just get in the car and show off, as he really wanted to have Naser's permission first. The dude had acted like a true friend towards him since the start, and he felt a strong sense of honesty and dedication coming off from him ever since they met. He was always willing to listen to Anon, always willing to help, and was just... a good guy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hell, Anon was willing to call him a brother. Maybe even family.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yo, Naser, can I PLEASE try something?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser glances towards Anon, uncomfortably awaiting his request. The human continues</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Can I take this thing for a spin and drive you all back? I'd love to try this sucker out!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser gives a long sigh as he had saw this question coming from a mile away. His dad had just given him permanent PTSD with his threat, so there was no way in all of the nine circles of hell that he was going to let him drive.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Absolutely not."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't you remember when my dad brought me to the back room for a little "talk"? Yeah, there's no way that's happening. Sorry bro."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser's response is quick and straight to the point, much less to Anon's disapproval. Quickly huffing at the rejection, Anon begins to walk toward the back left seat where he had been before, but notices a black luxury car with a pamphlet 4 spaces away from him. Jogging towards it, he starts to get a small, but dreadful feeling in his gut. It couldn't possibly be what it looks like, could it? Leaning down, he picks up the pamphlet to see a silhouette of a Margarita Glass with a pistol barrel sticking out of its right side. The feeling gets worse and his heartbeat begins to quickly accelerate.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh..."</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">In the distance, Anon can see four other humans coming out of a restaurant. They were all dressed in older-era dapper clothing, and one of them held a black and grey striped fedora to match the clothing of their suit. They had begun to stand around a pole, conversing with each other. Good, this was his one shot to warn the others before disaster struck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"GUYS?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The three called out to quickly snap their heads towards the worried voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"COME HERE, QUICK!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon's shout quickly brings them over behind him. He grabs the pamphlet, flips it open and holds it near his chest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We can't stay here long. Naser, I gotta drive us home, it's absolutely necessary, understand?" Naser rolls his eyes at the panicked Anon, not understanding his sudden fear.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Dude, we literally just went over this like 30 seconds ago. You are not driving my c-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon cuts him off with a finger to his mouth, turning over to the back of the car. He quickly checks the back of the vehicle to confirm his suspicions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The Mercedes logo seems to ominously stare into Anon's soul as he realizes who's here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I mean it, I know who these guys are we gotta go!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang starts to also get the feeling of dread bouncing in her stomach.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What the fuck are you talking about?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"These guys are not good news, Fang, they're part of a mafia called Shots, and they absolutely do NOT like me at all, so we need to-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A new voice twirls Anon's attention to the group by the pole one more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"There he is!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon goes into full panic mode as he's recognized and starts to run towards the NasCar driver's seat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"GO, GO, GO, GO! HURRY, GET IN THE CAR!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As if on instinct, everyone begins to run after Anon into their seats, with the exception of Naser.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'M DRIVING!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Bu-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"GET! IN THE FUCKING! CAR! RIGHT NOW!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser starts to take in the circumstances and jumps into the front passenger seat, never before seeing his friend like this. Anon quickly starts up the car, shifts the gear to reverse, and double checks to make sure everyone's in. With a look to his left, he sees the four human gangsters are already in their car, with one holding a pistol and aiming it at him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"SHIT!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon slams the gas pedal just in time as the bullet bounces off the front edge of the driver's window, to which everyone yelps at. He gets into the street and skillfully spins the car into the main road. The chase had just begun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The car very quickly accelerates down the main road as everyone begins to panic even more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"GO, ANON! GO, GO!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'M TRYING, DAMNIT!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As Anon hopelessly tries to reassure Fang, Naomi and Naser join in with a spaghetti-spilling train of their own.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">"BABE, WHAT'S HAPPENING?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I DON'T KNOW!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon regretfully takes a glance to his right as the gang had already caught up to them. He sees the man holding the pistol again, noticing an intention to shoot both Naser and him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Naser, DUCK!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The two of them do so right on time as a stream of bullets glaze by them in less then a second, with all but a scratch on Anon's forearm. He slams the brakes to get behind the Mercedes and hopefully avoid more gunfire. In fact, he needs to start returning some medicine of his own. Fishing into his jacket, Anon nabs his Ruger Mark IV from his inner pocket, much to Fang's surprise.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What the FUCK?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"COVER YOUR EARS!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ignoring the shout, Anon thwips out the pistol at the two gangsters in the back. BLAM. One bullet finds its way square in the chest of the man on the right... hello Tinnitus, my old friend. Anon doesn't have time to celebrate however, as the left pawn brings out an assault rifle and steadies their aim.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"FUCK!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon is forced to slam the gas once more, flying by the other car as bullets ricochet off of the doors and roof in rapid succession.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Things had started to become REALLY stressful. The screams of bystanders, the blinding lights, Naomi's crying, Naser's hyperventilation, and Fang's incoherent shouts to Anon all start to take their toll. He needed to concentrate more right now then he will probably ever have to, or else it would be the last time he tried.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"EVERYONE SHUT THE FUCK UP! I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE, LET ME DO THAT SO WE CAN LIVE!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That immediately turns the passengers silent. Anon spots a new intersection after about two miles of sheer terror. It's now or never.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Everyone hang on!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He swerves over to the farthest lane on the right before taking a hard drift left to the next street. Everyone almost falls on each other before Anon straightens out the car, snapping everyone back into place. They don't get a chance to recuperate before he accelerates full force once more. Ahead, there was an absence of street lights. This was PERFECT! Still speeding up, Anon gets to the last burning light and turns off the interior, front and tail lights. The pitch black nothingness of the night invades everyone's sight as the car heads to the right and starts to skid on the dirt. Anon narrowly avoids another crash with twists and turns, bringing the car to a full stop far past the side of the road.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He notions for everyone to stay where they are. At this point, no one was going to question his methods; Those ended up saving their asses. Anon struts to a nearby collection of bushes, gun in hand. The remaining three humans had to have still been chasing them. And speak of the devil, they are. Speeding at nearly 150 miles an hour, the intimidating Mercedes flies down the road, lights still on, with no clear end in the driver's sight. If this was going to work, it had to be perfect. No fucking this up now. Turning his flashlight to "Strobe" and "23000 Lumen" Anon holds the gun close to his side, patiently waiting for the car to get close enough to distract the remaining gangsters inside.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Here it comes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not yet...</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait...</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait...</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just a little longer...</div><div class="fanfic-line">AND-</div><div class="fanfic-line">NOW!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon jumps out of the bushes and turns on the strobe harsh enough to blind anyone. As the car is about to pass, he uses the opportunity to shoot at the back tire. Flying by, the Mercedes starts to swerve sideways, then it finally flips. In the distance, glass, doors, gears, and other machinery can be seen flying off the already totaled vehicle. It starts to flip more, and more, and MORE, speeding up every time contact is made with the asphalt. It finally stops at a metal pole, nearly piercing the car in half.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon stares at the scene before him, giving him the most relief that any living being could have ever been given. It unfortunately came with more ear-shredding Tinnitus plus a Migraine, but he could barely notice them at this point. What mattered is that the others were safe and that the threat is done for. He might be all by himself again, but that didn't matter right now. Everyone was going home safe and sound tonight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon quickly gets to the car and steps in without a word. He needs to get everyone to the hospital and inform the authorities of their scuffle. Turning on the lights once more, the badly beaten NasCar speeds down the road towards the bustling city streets.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div>
