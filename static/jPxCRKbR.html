Mous</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears had decided he would be that father figure come hell or high water.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Unfortunately their first interaction was cut far too short, Anon merely needed a food card</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears directed Mrs. Hunter to get the paperwork in order while he talked to the boy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Simple questions really</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When is your date of birth? Do you play any sports? How's your relationship with your father? Have you watched roro ni kenshin?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Nothing too suspicious</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The rest of the day passed quickly besides a small incident in the auditorium</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Mx. Aaron, Mrs. Freeman and, Mr. Pikeman had trouble with their performance</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The trouble being the student body reacting negatively</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A bit of shouting and hollow threats kept them in line</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon even went</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hopefully he was behaving himself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wait if he wasn’t that would mean Spears could deal out a lesson in discipline</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But that would mean he would have a delinquent son</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears stopped to contemplate which would be better, a delinquent or kind hearted son</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon was able to sneak away while spears was making his decision</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>From then on Spears took a great interest in Anon’s time at school</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Parent teacher night was an interesting night indeed</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Since Anon’s parents weren't able, or more likely not willing, to attend the young man decided to stay home</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears had derailed that by showing up at his door</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”I heard you didn’t have a parent for parent-teacher conferences. Maybe I could be your parent for tonight?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon didn’t really have a choice in the matter as Spears picked him up over his head and placed him back down in the car waiting outside</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The whole night was a fever dream</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears played the part of a parent perfectly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even the look of disappointment when his pathetic gym marks came to light</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The principal seemed pleased with how his science and music marks turned out though</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The teachers seemed to confused with what Spears was doing as well</div><div class="fanfic-line">>On the bright side Spears took Anon to get ice cream on the way back to his home</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon kind of wished the night could be wiped from memory, the looks he got from other students was getting to him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears on the other hand was quite happy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He was one step closer to his endgame</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon’s parents seemed to be open to letting the adoption happen</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now all Spears needed was to get the paperwork together and convince his wife</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He was planning to deal with the second one later tonight</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears got another bonding moment with Anon due to the young man continuing to download Saternia</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Such shit taste will need to be corrected in time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And that time was now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Since physical labour wasn’t effective, Spears decided to attack the problem at its source</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon, who had prepared for more work with the gardening club and more of Rosa’s food was more than a little frightened when he was sent directly to the principal’s office instead</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That fear was changed to befuddlement when Spears had wheeled in a small TV along with a plethora of classic Anime</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Pentagun, Spaceman Dedot, Roro ni kenshin, Outlaw Sun, and (You) (You) Hakusho to name a few</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon would have been down for watching anime any day</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But watching with his physically imposing principal on the weekend that normally would be for hard labour made the situation unverning</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The selection was good nonetheless, Pretty kino</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Every few episodes would be broken up by Spears discussing the history of the production and how “they don't make em like that anymore”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon just nodded along</div><div class="fanfic-line">>By the time they had finished it was getting close to dinner</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Quick as a flash Anon thanked his principal and dipped while Spears turned to his filing cabinet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He promised Fang a dinner date later after all</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This meant Spears revealed the adoption papers to an empty room</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And only that empty room would see Spears' single tear of anguish</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Eventually the last few weeks of the school year rolled up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Many crazy things had happened</div><div class="fanfic-line">>VVORM DRAMA played an good show at a small pizza joint, or so he overheard from some of the students</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon got doxxed for having made some embarrassing photos by Trish, that was not a fun situation to handle</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Thankfully Anon seemed to take his fatherly advice to heart and willing to talk with her about the situation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears had struggled to keep the feeling of pride from spilling out of his pockets like al dente pasta</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It had been an interesting school semester with only one flaw</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Graduation was coming soon and Spears had yet to breach the topic of adoption to Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As soon as he was graduated the probability of Spears getting a chance to ask him was nil</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Thus a plan was formed</div><div class="fanfic-line">>An end of the year camping trip</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A trip that required a parents permission to attend</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Most likely Lucy, the school’s local punk rock princess, would attend the trip along with her friends</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon would join the trip as well to have continued hangouts with his girlfriend</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Excellent choice by the way my son</div><div class="fanfic-line">>However since Anon’s parents were not around to sign it the responsibility would fall to him as principal to give permission</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And thus the adoption papers could be presented</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Truly devious Spears</div><div class="fanfic-line">>So imagine his surprise when Anon showed up on the last day with a signed permission slip</div><div class="fanfic-line">>From the Aaron no less</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Was this a joke of some sort</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The smug looks of satisfaction shot in his direction from Ripley, Samantha, and even young Naser proved otherwise</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The family pulled Anon and Lucy into a tight family group hug, still holding his gaze</div><div class="fanfic-line">>So that's how it was going to be then</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears walked over to discuss the fact of their signatures on Anon slip</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley spoke up first “Well the kid had been hanging around our little Lucy a good bit now so we thought why not, I’d hate to ruin young love”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Then Samantha “Besides the sheet said parent or guardian and we’ve been having over so much lately he's practically like another son”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That was disconcerting but understandable</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If he could see how much Anon need proper parental units in his life so could others</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The Aarons may have a leg up on him due to their relation through Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But that wouldn’t stop Principal Spears Primal</div><div class="fanfic-line">>On his ancestor Jack Samurai’s honor, he would adopt that boy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The principal bid the Aarons farewell and jumped on the bus</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The trip went as smoothly as expected with a bus pack full of hormonal teenagers</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Upon arriving at the campsite Spears was given another surprise</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The rest of the Aaron family was there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Don’t worry about us, we were just taking a small vacation up to our cottage near here. And don't be surprised if we steal Lucy and her boyfriend every once and awhile.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The words of the matriarch shook Spears to his core</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Clearly this excursion would not be so simple</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In fact it seemed to be an uphill battle</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears vs the Aarons</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A series of wacky hijinks to monopolize Anon’s time ensued</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears started strong by calling the students to a nearby lake for swimming with the intention to teach Anon swimming much like his father before him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Riply countered by taking Anon onto the middle lake for fishing, just father and future son in law</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Spears quickly hurled a large rock onto one side of the boat flinging Anon back to dry land before they could get too far out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon was then swept up by Samantha who had made snacks</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This is how the entire trip proceeded, two groups of adults fighting to take control of parenting a young man on the cusp of adulthood</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All Anon wanted to do was sneak into the forest to make out with Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In the end no one got what they wanted</div>
