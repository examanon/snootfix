This is a rental and I definitely don’t want to have to deal with getting into an accident.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I don’t think you want to deal with crashing any car, dude.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Could I get a zipper surgically attached or something?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I quickly glance back at Fang, her smile has faded, lost in thought again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She’d get like this from time to time during our visit, at first I thought it was nerves, but Rock Bottom is long behind us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In fact, she seems to be ruminating even harder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Babe,” I start.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She let’s out a long sigh, it seems this was something she was dreading to bring up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Do you want to talk about it?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s about Naomi.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ah yes, Naomi, the girl responsible for getting Fang and I together. While I’m ultimately grateful that she guided us into a relationship, I didn’t exactly enjoy the idea of being manipulated, and neither did Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>However, Fang explained to me that they ended up having a heart-to-heart and now they were on good enough terms to be roommates.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What about Naomi?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, you know how she and Naser are on break, like we are?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, Naser got a new girlfriend and Naomi found out about it.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oof, knowing Naomi she had already plotted out how she was going to get Naser back and how they were going to live out the perfect life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But she didn’t anticipate Naser actually finding someone else.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I can only imagine how shattering it must be for her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anyway, she’s been super mopey and annoying ever since she found out, and so…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Something tells me I won’t like where this is going.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon, I need you to fuck Naomi so she can shut the fuck up and get over Naser.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I nearly swerve off the road again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I’m on autopilot as my brain reboots.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang, the love of my life and the one woman I could see my future with just asked me to cheat on her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You’re not cheating Anon, I’ll be there, it’ll be a threesome.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“That…’s a little better.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Whose idea was this, was it Naomi’s? Was she trying to get between me and Fang and break us up since she can’t have her perfect relationship?</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No, it was my idea. She was being super depressing all week before you came to visit. I might have said something after she spent almost every night watching shitty rom-coms and eating literal gallons of ice cream.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why did she agree to this?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I don’t know, Anon. She just looked so pathetic. I was getting tired of her bitching and moaning and it just... came out of my mouth. At first she was pissed, livid, she couldn’t believe I would even say that.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If I wasn’t right here listening to this right now, I wouldn’t believe it either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“But the next morning it was like she was back to her old self. She even made a big breakfast to thank me, and she made sausage and bacon. Sausage. And. Bacon, Anon! Bacon! She’s vegan! And it was the real shit, not that soy crap she would always try to sell me on.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It always was easy to get Fang to agree on something if you used food as a mediator.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I focus on the road as I struggle to think of something to say, I open my mouth only to close it again as no words come to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“’Nonny, I get it, I blindsided you with this. I just didn’t want to ruin our time with your parents.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s alright, Sweet Tooth… I’ll think about it. You just kind of dumped this on me without a proper warning.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Right, sorry Anon.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She leans back into the seat and crosses her arms, turning her head toward the passenger window.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Right on cue I see the sign, “Welcome to Volcaldera Bluffs! Home to Historic Dino-Moe’s Pizza!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A part of me wanted to ask Moe for advice, but that would be a much too awkward conversation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The next few hours are spent in relative silence as we take care of a few errands before going to Fang’s apartment... the one she shares with Naomi... the girl she wants me to have a threesome with.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Honestly, for any other guy this would be a dream come true, but something about the whole thing seemed off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I return the rental car, the Bluffs has pretty good public transportation, so it would be an unnecessary expense.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I also wanted to stretch out the time we had alone together, before we meet up with Naomi.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>We decide to drop by Trish and Reed’s place to say hello, and do a little catching up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish opens the door and is excited to see Fang, I, however, am met with a curt, “oh, hey,” before she lets us in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I see that things haven’t changed much between us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The purple triceratops and my girlfriend begin chatting and I immediately tune them out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fortunately, Reed was out at the moment, which gave me ample opportunity to sort out my thoughts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I take on a thinking pose with my hand over my mouth just to make sure I don’t say anything out loud.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi was kind of hot back in high school, even if she annoyed me to no end.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But she was still a manipulator, someone who wouldn’t be satisfied unless everything went her way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Taking Fang’s story into account, she didn’t seem too into the idea of doing it with me, so why the 180?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Was she trying to break Fang and me up? Fang doesn’t think so, but what else was there to gain from this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even if I take it at face value, there were still some red flags.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her boyfriend that she had planned her entire life around suddenly decides to break it off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Normally this would be something you could get over in a few months, but for someone like Naomi, it would be soul crushing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She moves in with the sister of her ex.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This also wouldn’t be too bad if it weren’t for the bad blood they had before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Back in high school, Naomi saw Fang as an obstacle that took too much of Naser’s attention away from her. That’s why she paired the two of us together, to get Fang out of the way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Moving in with Fang was probably a good way to keep tabs on Naser without having to resort to stalking him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now he has a new girl and any chance that her plans could go back on track is now very slim.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Breaking us up won’t bring Naser back, but there’s no way that she’s thinking clearly anymore. I’ll have to be careful of any tricks she might pull.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I’m not saying she’ll try to sperm-jack me, but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We’ll have to go by the drugstore and buy some fresh condoms, just in case.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As I finish my thoughts, I realize that Fang and Trish aren’t talking anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang is covering her face in embarrassment while Trish has her trademark pissed off expression.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Did I say that last part out loud?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After leaving Trish and Reed’s we stop by a corner store and pick up a box of condoms.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This is pretty much a confirmation that I’ve agreed to Fang’s... proposition and her mood lifted.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There was now a pep in her step as we walked to her apartment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She’s humming the song we wrote together and dancing along the sidewalk almost as if she’s in some sort of musical.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>God, she’s so adorable, it’s almost enough to make me forget about what we were going to do tonight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now that I think about it, I haven’t really thought about why Fang was so into this idea.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey Fang-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We’re here~!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I look up at the buildings we stopped in front of, these weren’t apartments, these were townhouses, nice townhouses. There was even a gate in front.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang types a number into the keypad and the gate rumbles and rolls along its track to allow us in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Whatever reasons Fang has, I trust her. I only need to keep an eye on Naomi.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As we near the door a pleasant aroma wafted from Fang’s place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Naomi made dinner for us tonight.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I grimace, I definitely don’t want any vegan food.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Don’t worry Honey, she told me what she was making, it’ll be fine, plus she’s a good cook.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That was a small relief, but I was still uneasy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang pulls out her key and unlocks the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m home~,” Fang sings.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>From the kitchen I can hear Naomi dropping what she was doing and rushing to meet us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi remains relatively unchanged since high school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her hair is a bit longer and her figure has filled out a bit more, no doubt depression weight after separating from Naser.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>However a big change was her smile, it was genuine. It wasn’t that fake, plastic mask she would wear whenever she needed to sell the facade of a well meaning, but naive social butterfly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang! Welcome back, did you have fun at Anon’s parents’?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah, it was great, we’re planning on visiting again during his next break. We might even have both of our parents meet.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not too thrilled with that idea.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi turns to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon, it’s been so long since we last saw each other! How have you been?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Before I answer she pulls me into a tight hug.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her breasts press into my chest as she strokes my back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Mmm, have you been working out? You seem a lot more muscular now.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I have been, one of my dorm mates is a Kinesiology major and needed data on humans. He basically offered to be my personal trainer for free.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Y-yeah,” I manage to let out. “A little bit here and there.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I wanted to look good for Fang, but getting a compliment from another girl wasn’t too bad. I couldn’t help smiling.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I look toward my girlfriend who had her own smile, but it was quickly falling the longer this hug took.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I take the hint.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“By the way, Naomi,” I grab her shoulders. “What are you cooking?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naomi quickly pulls away from me and glances at Fang. She gives her a look and Naomi winces. Whatever agreement they had, Naomi must have toed the line a little too much.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh, ah, yes, I, ah, uh,” she stammers. “I’m making beef and tofu teriyaki, steamed dumplings, and miso soup. I’ve got almost everything prepped and I’m steaming the dumplings. Once I’m done it’ll only take a few minutes to cook everything else.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Everything sounded pretty great, outside of the tofu, but if the sauce was good I’m sure I could tolerate it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon,” Fang wraps her arms around one of mine. “Why don’t we go freshen up while she finishes?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang’s room isn’t much different here than it was at her parents’.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The walls aren’t painted black, but there’s still band posters and movie posters scattered about. She even had her wall mounted guitar stands.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I hope she can get her deposit back with all the holes she’s poked into the walls.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Eh, I’ll just fill them with plaster and paint over them, they’ll never know.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Still thinking about getting that zipper attached.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang snickers as she saunters over to me. She grabs me by the collar and pulls me down and plants her snout on my lips.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It’s a kiss we’ve practiced time and time again to the point that it became art.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Our tongues grope and caress each other as I adjust my posture and embrace her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It’s insane how compatible we are, how our bodies conform, contour, and compliment each other.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If you told me at the beginning of high school that my soulmate was a dino... I probably would’ve called you a fag, but I also wouldn’t believe you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I look at Fang, she had a half lidded, sultry expression.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I might be sharing you tonight, Anon Y. Mous, but you are mine. No other man I know comes close to you.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I love this woman.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Now, let’s go take a shower.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>While sexy time in the shower seems like a no brainer, we are both incredibly hungry. So this was a no-nonsense experience.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The feathers on Fang’s arms and wings are water repellent, but they’re still a pain to clean, especially the joints where her wings meet her back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She hands me the pouf and I scrub around the joints, careful not to get her feathers and damage the waxy coating. Then I get the rest of her back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fuck, that feels good,” she moans.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This is my favorite part about showering together.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I slowly make my way down to her tail before I scrub it vigorously ensuring I get all sides, especially the bottom, because...</div><div class="fanfic-line">“MMM, FUCK! Save some of that for later!” She says as she moves her ass closer to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ha ha, alright, alright, I couldn’t help myself.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I turn around.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Alright, now do me.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I hand Fang my washcloth and she lathers the soap bar into it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeesh, I really did a number on you here,” she traces a line on my back with her claw.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I wear it with pride, my love. It means I did a good job.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She playfully smacks the same spot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>My face contorts a bit, that one was a little sensitive, but I don’t think Fang noticed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>While she washes my back I notice her hands are delicate, wary around the scratches and scars decorating my back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m sorry.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Don’t be, like I said, I wear them with pride.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When she finishes, I feel her press her body against mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Your back is so big,” she mumbles to herself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looks like I might be rubbing off on her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>We stand in silence as the water runs down our bodies, savoring this moment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Then knocking on the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Are you two almost done? The food’s ready!”</div>
