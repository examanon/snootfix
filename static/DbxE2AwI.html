The air inside is frigid cold despite the lukewarm early dawn summer air outside, a welcome respite for the weary family of tourists that sat at one of the windowside tables as their children stared out into the night and chewed on their wholly inappropriate breakfast of dry cheesy pork sausage rolls that had been turning in the warmer since last evening. The television blasted out a rerun of a story on VNN as the smell of cheap coffee battled it out with the harsh, sterile scent of the blue chemical that thankfully mostly covered up the stench of the neglected bathrooms.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Principal Spears yawned and stretched his neck, sighing in relief as he felt the aching of driving at such early hours ease up after a few quiet pops. He stared at the half-dead coffee machine that was slowly dripping its burnt caffeine goodness into the first of two cheap styrofoam cups. At least it provided him an excuse to relax a little before he would rejoin his sleeping wife in the car.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A set of heavy, shambling footsteps pulled his attention away from his morning coffee.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ah! Sheriff Ripley, good morning. I’m surprised to see you all the way out here.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Mornin’ Principal... Spears...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Having an early start? Or maybe a late night?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Late night. The boys in the next precinct over were planning a massive midnight drug bust on a den right on the border and they requested our help. Sent over six squad cars and a chopper. Shoulda’ sent the whole damn force in hindsight.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Sounds like quite the operation.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It was, Raptor Jesus, it was. Spent the entire night rounding up a bunch of dealers hopped up on their own goods through the woods. Ever seen a dino hopped up on Blue Sparkle or BigPig or whatever they’re callin’ it nowadays?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I… can’t say I have?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s crazy stuff. I swear one of them turned into a skinnie from how he was swinging from the trees… Oh uh, sorry ‘bout that Principal...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No worries. I’m glad I never had to deal with that at Volcano High. The worst case I’ve witnessed was a student accidentally bringing his marijuanna. Although I do suspect one of my students was on something a little stronger. Carfentanyl, perhaps. I never did catch them but from how the smell seems to have disappeared I suspect the student in question has graduated.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Heh. Carf. I wish I was dealing with Carfers. If that’s the worst at your place then you’ve ran that school well.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Thank you, Sheriff. Ah. It looks like it’s full. I’ve got another cup to fill for my wife, would you like to go first?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Nah… Nah, thanks but you go ahead, I might just stare at the doughnuts til you’re done… I ain’t got anywhere to go but home anyhow... From the getup I’m guessin’ you’re on a little summer break road trip?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“That’s right. My wife and I are visiting her family in Wyoming.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Wyoming, huh. Gonna catch an early flight?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Unfortunately no. My wife is terrified of planes.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh hell, don’t tell me you’re driving all the way over there!?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We are. We flew the last time we visited but she couldn’t handle it. In any case it won’t be just a drive. We do plan on visiting a few places in between. Mostly the usual tourist attractions but my wife swears that there is a restaurant that we absolutely have to stop at on the way.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Sounds fun. How’s your wife, by the way?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Very well, thank you for asking. She made sure we had her favorite Korean war drama for the trip. The Burning Flower of Incheon and the Enraged Dragon of Water, all fifty-two episodes.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Heh, you into that sorta stuff?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Unfortunately no. It’s interesting enough to be entertaining, however my tastes lie slightly more to the east.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You bring any of your own stuff?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No. I can’t be distracted while driving and my wife can’t stand most of what I like anyways.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Man’s gotta make sacrifices for the wife, eh?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“As all husbands must. There we are, I’m sorry it took so long.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Egh… Don’t worry about it. This whole place is falling apart.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“...damn, no hazelnut creamer.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hazelnut? I mean no offence but I always assumed police officers liked their coffee straight black.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Most don’t but they still get it like that. Rookies, the lot of ‘em. Think they gotta act macho in front of the boss. Nuts to that, I want my doughnut to be the healthy option.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“And I assume the doughnut will be similarly sugared?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Haha! You got that right! Plain? Dunked in coffee? No thanks. Powdered sugar, sprinkles, filled with as much lemon creme without it burstin’. I see enough rough garbage out there, no need to eat it too. Just don’t tell my wife. She always gets on my case about how I need to watch my sugar intake.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Overconsumption of sugar is unhealthy, that much is true.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I know, I know. But it’s the sugar or I take my wife with me to work and I can’t take my wife with me to work.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“How sweet.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Don’t tell her that either, she’s never gonna forget it.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Perhaps you should. It would sweeten the marriage a little bit.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ha! Ya know, maybe I will. Our anniversary’s coming up next week. ‘My Dearest Samantha, Your Sugar To My Coffee.’ Hah, that’s a good one! I’m getting that one on a ring!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“On a ring?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“She’s into that sort of corny, sappy romantic garbage. Hell, it might actually work.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well in any case, Congratulations on your marriage, Sheriff.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Thanks, buddy. You gettin’ a doughnut too?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I don’t think I will. We do have sandwiches in the car but I do want a hot breakfast...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hot, eh? You gotta get the hashbrowns then. It’s the one thing this place does great. I dunno if it’s the oil they use or what but that kid back there knows what the hell he’s doing.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well now I’m going to have to, if it’s good enough for you to recommend it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh yeah, you’re gonna want to get at least two per person.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Two?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yep, one to eat hot and the second to eat after it’s cooled off first. It’s crazy but I swear it tastes even better cold.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Interesting.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah, sometimes I get a half-dozen if I know I’m going to be out for a while. Ooh, ‘nother thing to keep from my wife. Too much salt, she says.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Husband’s honor.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“From how you’ve run that school I feel I can take that to the bank.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Thank you very much again, Sheriff. I’m honored.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey now, both my kids have a good future. Any principal that makes that possible is good in my book! Tell ya what, your coffee and hash browns are on me today!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh, there’s no need to go that far out of your way for me!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Nuts, let’s just call it thanks for all you’ve done! Need anything else?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No, I think I’ve got everything I wanted.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You sure? No snacks? No drinks or- Ooh, sorry. I don’t wanna keep your lady waiting.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No worries, Sheriff. She’s still fast asleep.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Right, right. So when will I see ya next? In Autumn?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“That’s correct. We’ll be back in mid-August, just in time for the school’s open house.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Nice. See ya then, Principal Spears.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“And you, Sheriff Ripley.”</div>
