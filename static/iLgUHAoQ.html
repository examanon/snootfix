                    <div class="fanfic-line">December 28th, 201M2019 BC</div><div class="fanfic-line">â€‹</div><div class="fanfic-line">Now, I know you don't like doing this, but we need to have a little heart to heart.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You're in a new home, a new town, and there's no one looking at you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's perfect. That's exactly what you're supposed to be doing. You'd better keep it up this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Do you think I should tell you why you did that? Leave it all behind?</div><div class="fanfic-line">No?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, that's too bad. I'm going to remind you once again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just to make sure you know what you're doing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">There you were, Rock Bottom, having the time of your life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">With no one suspicious of you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">No one to come close to you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">No one to be hurt by you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">And then, one day...</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nope, you're not getting out of this. You need to remember your mistakes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">One day, you met the most beautiful velociraptor alive.</div><div class="fanfic-line">That beautiful, striking red. You couldn't take your eyes off it!</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her messy hair, her no nonsense attitude, you loved it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">...And you loved her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">So, you confessed your feelings for her, and she did so back to you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You two were like peas in a pod. You both were inseparable.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Only held back by the limits of time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">But that was a mistake.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Letting people get close to you? You know how that turns out. Every time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You two had been together for almost a year.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even within that amount of time, your bond became unbreakable.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Until they came along.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Those God-damn gangsters, who just wanted to stick it to you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Simply for being a part of an enemy gang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It wasn't even personal. They just wanted to make anyone who may have been associated suffer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The Shots. They had already killed your parents a long time ago, but now they were back for more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">When they found out where you were, they took her from you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You didn't even get to say goodbye.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You couldn't protect her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">There it was: Her bullet-ridden corpse left right in your backyard to rot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Those ocean-blue eyes turned dull and hollow, devoid of any color.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The beautiful raptor who had brought light into your life was gone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">All because you thought you could try to be someone else.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You're a wood-chipper.</div><div class="fanfic-line">People don't get hurt because that was the intention of your creation, but it's because they get too close.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You have no quarrel against them, it is a simple law of nature.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Unlike the wood-chipper, however, it is still your fault. You have the sentience to understand this rule, but you ignore it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Every single time you think you can change, this happens.</div><div class="fanfic-line">No exceptions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">If you knew how to protect them, maybe you could live a normal life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">But, no.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You couldn't protect her, and you can't protect anyone now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">What if this happens in the future?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Are you going to just let them die again?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Are you going to allow innocent bystanders to suffer just because they wanted to be with you?</div><div class="fanfic-line">How are you going to protect them?</div><div class="fanfic-line">You don't do a good job at saving lives.</div><div class="fanfic-line">So, that's why you've done this again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Leave it all behind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of course, you made sure her murderers were served justice, but even with that you'd overstayed your welcome.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her parents knew about everything that happened, and began to know who you really were.</div><div class="fanfic-line">So... you gave them mercy in their last moments.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You could never risk a chance of allowing anybody to report your identity to the authorities.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You've done too much.</div><div class="fanfic-line">If they ever caught you, you'd die.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You may regret killing them and making it look like an accident for the rest of your life...</div><div class="fanfic-line">but it's a sacrifice you had to take.</div><div class="fanfic-line">That was one sacrifice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The other was officially leaving your gang behind, letting it fade into the back of your mind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Your boss was saddened by your decision, but in the end, he understood your intentions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He even said to you "If yous ever got anyone giving yous trouble, let us know."</div><div class="fanfic-line">The faceless boss may have never given you 100% of his trust, but he still treated you like a son.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Especially ever since your parent's deaths.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He was like a father to you, and you made sure to let him know that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's good to see he still cares for you and understands your choice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the end, after you finished your errands, you ran.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You ran as far as possible, leaving no trace of yourself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Now, you're someone else.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You don't have a name for anyone to track you down and look inside you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You've disappeared.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You are Anonymous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You're just another background character deep in the crowd.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You'll have no one to love, no outside friend who understands you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the end, that's okay.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Do you see why I'm telling you all of this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's so you don't screw this up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You may not like having no one, but it's something you're willing to accept.</div><div class="fanfic-line">You're just... Anonymous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">And now, no more innocent people will be hurt by you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's better this way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">For you, and for everyone.</div>
