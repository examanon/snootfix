                <div class="fanfic-text">
                    <div class="fanfic-line">It was yet another boring day at school, with the daily slog of dealing with people I wanted fuck all to do with continued on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Except for this day in particular, is shittier than others. I note as I’m leaning against the stiff stone wall of Volcano High’s hallway, right next to the door to the office of a very dangerous caveman.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fucking hell. How did they even find out this time?? I did everything right, I used a VPN, I used the computer farthest from the librarian, hell I even downloaded the files straight to the portable drive I brought to school!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Principal Spears was pretty upset that I used the school’s wifi to torrent some shows, getting all those ISP warning letters would leave a possible stain on the school’s reputation. The last time he sent me to help with the gardening club, I swear Rosa is an absolute slave driver, and it’s impossible to get ANYTHING done with Stella yapping in my ear about all the newest shonen or esoterica crap she obsesses over.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“ANON! GET YOUR SCRAWNY ASS IN HERE NOW!!” A thunderous roar bellows from the door inside, strong enough to blow out my eardrums.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, time waits for no one…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Opening the door, I’m greeted with the sight of a near immaculate office paired with a well-polished desk, nothing seems to have changed since the last time I’ve been here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Take a seat, Anon.” My eyes are directed towards the stern yet intimidating caveman sitting across the desk, motioning with his massive baseball mitt of a hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before my brain can ever register his words, my body already makes its way toward the aforementioned seat. I REALLY do not wanna piss him off again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m disappointed in you son, I’ve told you once already that you cannot use the school's internet services to be illegally downloading TV shows.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Moments after the worlds leave his move, Spear’s stern look on his face becomes more relaxed. “Although I am proud to hear you have taken my suggestions to heart and have begun examining some of the anime that I was able to recommend to you, it’s the least I could do to help improve your shit taste.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Phew… So does that mean-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“HOWEVER!” The sudden tonal shift in his voice tells me that I’m not out of the woods yet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You still broke the rules of our schools and risked tarnishing our reputation, and in spite of the reason for your actions, I am afraid I am still going to have to punish you.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well shit… I guess I get some actual gardening clothes this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Okay, Principal Spears… What day did you want to send me to the Gardening Club?” I ask with a mixture of dejection and reluctance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">His eyebrows raise questioningly as if he is confused by my question?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“The Gardening Club? No Anon, I believe a different change of scenery might suit you better.” A devilish grin begins to grow on the gargantuan caveman’s face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“For the remainder of the day, you will act as a student assistant in Room 132, the classroom for our school’s students with special needs.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No…. Dear god no…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A phantom pain begins to flare up in my chest, mirroring the tumble I took down the school’s stairs a few weeks ago, but worse…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"YOU MAKE TROSH CRY?!?!" The terrifying roars of the jolly green tard echo through my head, sending a wave of fear through my body</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No... Sir please anything but that, I’ll help with the gardening club for the entire month, I’ll help with the upcoming assemblies, I’ll even clean up after Prom if you want! Please just anything but that!” I plea to my Principal, who looks at me completely unmoved by my more than evident desperation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Come now, Anon. I think helping out with our handicapable students would be a good experience for you and help you grow, besides my decision is final.” The shit-eating grin on the caveman’s face returns to the stoic expression I just saw from him moments prior.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Rest assured, your participation will not affect your marks, and your teachers will be sure to assign you any work you may have missed.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck… Half a day with those… things..</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I barely survived two minutes around those fuckers… How am I gonna make it through three hours?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“If you have no further questions, we have an additional student assistant who will escort you there.” Spear’s affirmation pulled me out of my pity party. Another student assistant he says?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“SAGE! GET THE FUCK IN HERE NOW!!!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Huh, so this is what Tinnitus feels like?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not a moment sooner, the door flings open to reveal a…. A… what?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I-I’m here Principal Spears!” An androgynous voice chokes out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Standing in front of the door frame is a rather anxious-looking purple Raptor wearing a plain white shirt with overalls. I have no fucking clue if this kid is a girl or a guy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Do you have any further questions Mr. Mous?” The principal’s words snapped me back to reality.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If you act any more autistic Anon, he might transfer you into the GVH room for good.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Uh…. No, none at all sir.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Spears lets out a sigh as his posture relaxes in his chair. “I see, you two are excused, and Sage!” He directs his attention toward the bumbling femboy standing at the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“See to it that Anon is well acquainted with all the proper procedures necessary to be a good student assistant.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Of course Principal Spears!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">About five minutes pass and I am reminded of how far away our destination is from the rest of the school…. Well, we would have made it sooner if Sage hadn’t stopped us to confront someone in the hall for saying the word “retard”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! IT’S 2020, NOBODY SHOULD BE USING SUCH OUTDATED AND ABLEIST SLURS TOWARDS MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Bro… Literally, all I just said was that PachyStation raising the prices of their games is retard-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“BRO?! I USE SHE/HER PRONOUNS YOU FUCKING PTERO MALE ASSHOLE!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, that clears up that question, I SERIOUSLY owe Fang an apology now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But other than that, plus the occasional huffing that came from Sage when she (I think) overheard some of the conversations that we passed by in the halls, we managed to get there in one piece.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But now my death march has reached its end, and Sage and I are standing in front of the entrance of my final resting place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Room: 132, The GVH Room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At least they manage to fix the door this time..</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Alright, Ay-non.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can tell I'm already not going to like this little boy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“These friends of ours have certain difficulties, so let’s try to be as sensitive and patient as we can, okay?” Sage addresses me in a condescending manner that makes Naomi look humble in comparison.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Uhh.. Sure.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Alright, let’s go in-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">THUD THUD THUD THUD</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“YO BRO, STOP, STOP!!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Both Sage and I turn our heads towards the thunderous commotion to see…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh no…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">DEAR GOD NO!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">STONK IS RUNNING TOWARDS US FULL SPEED!!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">FUCK I’M GONNA DIE! I’M GONNA FUCKING DIE! I’VE WASTED MY ENTIRE LIFE ON-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">THUD THUD THUD THUD</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">On… what? CRASH</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My despair quickly evaporates when I see that Stonk has completely passed by Sage and I, as she complete runs through the classroom’s door, effortlessly knocking off the hinges as it clatters across the room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“DEUVUBUBBBIIIIIL.” Stella’s tardy doppelganger groans as she lays face down on the ground.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“STONK! WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT RUNNING THROUGH THE DOOR?!” A feminine yet elderly voice echoes from inside the room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fuck! *Pant* Are you dudes okay?!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Our eyes turn towards the voice approaching from the halls, seeing a rather muscular-looking Megalodon male paired with a black wife beater and red shades. Isn’t he the captain of the school’s football team?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“She… was.. I… sorry… Sage…” Barely managing to choke out as he desperately tries to catch his breath.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The fear inside grows exponentially at the realization that if the school’s football captain couldn’t even hold her back, then none of us are safe…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Goddamnit Chet!!! This is the fourth time the room’s door has been broken, Mrs. Roberts already has it out for me as it is!” Sage points her finger and the incapacitated tard wrangler. “Why did you have to trigger Stonk’s sensitivity?!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Suddenly the weariness in Chet’s turns to surprise, clearly taken aback by the diminutive tyrant’s accusation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Trigger her sensitivity?? What you talkin’ bout brah? I didn’t-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“WHAT DID I FUCKING TELL YOU ABOUT CALLING ME ‘BRAH’ YOU FUCKING CIS SCUM?!” Sage suddenly explodes with rage that startles the imposing Megaladon. “First, you make no effort to aid our neurodivergent friends! And now you continue to misgender me and spit in my face?! FUCK YOU!!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Despite the vast height difference between the two with Chet having at least two feet above Sage. Sage’s fury and rancor cause Chet to dwarf in comparison.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Okay br- Sage, I’m sorry fam!” Chet’s voice breaks slightly with fear as he begins to back away from both of us</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuck is even happening today? “What?” Sage asks me, her voice hinting at slight aggression.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“U-uh, nothing! Should we go inside?” I try to diffuse any tension between us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thankfully it seems to work as Sage’s expression relaxes as she nods, and the two of us enter the room, thanks to the absence of a door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Similarly to before, I see the typical furnishings of a special ed room, a fridge, cooking area, exercise ball, a trampoline, and an old-ass TV that looks like it would be perfect for playing Rock Ring split-screen, assuming Fang and the gang would EVER be willing to play with me…. Well, I mean Reed might.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“...But Bugs are so gayyyyy, they totally eat poop.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“N-NO! B-BUGS ARE COOL YOU QUEER!!!” A familiar sounding screech echoes from my left, grabbing the attention of Sage and I. My eyes manage to spot Trosh talking with…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait… What the actual fuck?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“REED?!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘Reed’ looks over to me with a rather snooty yet blank face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Uhhhh…. No, it’s Reeee dumbass.. Heheheheheh.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hmmm…. Okay…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Only now do I notice the anger emanating from Sage. The raptor’s tan face turns into a mixture of red as she becomes flustered by the slur that was just uttered from the tardy triceratops.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“HEY! WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT USING THOSE TYPES OF WORDS?! YOU CAN’T BE USING THAT WORD AS AN INSULT-” Sage begins to rant as she approaches the two, leaving me standing alone in the middle of the room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I don’t care… Those are funny words, stop being gay Sage.” Reee blows her off with the most nonchalant yet absentminded expression possible. “You’re gay, this classroom’s gay, Trosh is gay, and that skinnie over there is gay.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reee’s liberal use of the word “gay” makes me feel like I’m in a Jurrasic Warfare 2 lobby, or on the Skronker account of some Canadian game studio.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Reeee! It’s very offensive to be using words like those as derogatory terms, how would you feel if-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hehehehehe, you said dog.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“DOG???! I LIKE DOG, ESPECIALLY PUGS! BECAUSE THEY LOOK LIEK BUGS!!!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So is this just going to be three hours of just this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I just stand there blankly as the three begin to argue with each other to the point where it becomes noise pollution as their bickering overlaps with each other.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Mr. Mous? Could I have a word with you?” The same elderly voice from earlier calls out, pulling my attention as I walk toward the source of the sound.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That’s when my eyes spot the purple Tyrannosaurus Rex adorned with a black dress sitting down at a rather dishevelled desk. As I approach, I spot her sipping from a coffee mug, while also taking note of the metal flask placed right in front of her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Welcome Mr. Mous, I am Mrs. Roberts, I am one of the teachers of the GVH Room and you will be reporting to me for the remainder of the day.” She addresses me in a rather curt manner as she sets down the coffee mug on her desk, slightly staining the surface.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ah, y-yes ma'am.” I nearly stumble over my words. “How… Did you want me to help today?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Today, you will be assisting Sage with chaperoning the classroom’s students.” Mrs. Roberts explained with a flat yet serious voice. “Normally we would have around 7 students, but today we only have the three because the remainder of the class is on a field trip to the Volcadera Animal Sanctuary.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn’t even know such a place existed. Wait, there’s one thing I’m curious about though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So wait, why didn’t Trosh, Reeee, and Stonk go on the trip with them?” I ask with a degree of caution, she doesn’t exactly look like the friendliest of teachers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The Tyrannosaurus closed her eyes and let out a sigh. “Trosh refused to attend the trip because due to the animal sanctuary not containing insects.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Reeee has been barred from attending with the rest of the class due to some disparaging comments he made about… humans last week, along with some… unsavoury remarks about his fellow… Triceratops students…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hmmm… You know what, maybe this clone of Reed isn’t so bad after all…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“And Stonk… Well…” A look of concern begins to grow on Mrs. Roberts's face as she looks past me and towards Stonk, who appears to be laying face-first on the ground.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Y-yeah, I think I got the picture,” I assure the troubled Tyrannasauraus who doesn’t break her gaze from the hulking Stegosaruaus.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Alright, if you have any inquires concerning your duties or fellow students, Sage will be able to assist you.” The sternness returns to Mrs. Roberts's voice as she finally breaks her voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Okay, sounds good!” I turn towards her for a brief moment, only to be pulled away as a disgusting retching sound fills the classroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“BBBGARRKGLLLLGFPPPH!!!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Turning around to investigate the noise, my stomach churns when my eyes recognize what just happened.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stonk just vomited all over the remains of the classroom door, and the pieces of undigested hot dogs and stomach acid begin to drip on the floor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hahahahahahaha, gay.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Behind me, I hear the metallic sound of a lid being opened followed by the pouring of liquid.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">….I fucking hate my life so much.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The next hour and a half went by about as fast as a paraplegic snail. Dealing with figurative tards throughout school has always worn me down, but dealing with LITERAL tards? It’s not as funny as those fucking green text stories on those Croatian taxidermy forums make it out to be.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The sudden cacophony of shrill sounds that drown out the previous noises suddenly pulls me out of my thoughts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Okay, maybe a little bit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Reeee, I told you already, we no longer use outdated terms such as “Asperger’s Syndrome!” The proper term is “Autistic Spectrum Disorder!” Sage reprimanded Reeee who sat at the desk blankly staring at her with a clear lack of amusement on his face.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Uhh… no, the doctor told me it’s called ‘Ass Burger syndrome, retard.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In contrast to Sage’s uncharacteristic patient demeanour with the denizens of the GVH Room, the purple accents on her face turn red as she bristles with anger towards Reeee’s comment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Excuse me?! We DEFINITELY do not say the ‘r word’ here!” The androgynous raptor roars with anger as her rant grows louder. “THE “R” WORD HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE DAMAGING TOWARDS THE DISABLED COMMUNITY AS IT PERPETUATES THE STIGMA THAT DI-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“SHUT FUCK UP SADGE!!!!” A deep yet powerful voice bellows from across the table.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My eyes trail towards Stonk has sunk into her chair, her hands gripping a crayon as she stares at Sage dead-eyed</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“NO ONE CARES! STOP BEING RETARD!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Pfft… Based.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I’m doing everything in my power to not burst out laughing at what Stonk said, Sage is just standing there frozen, mouth agape, completely taken aback by what the green goliath said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess self-righteous arguments found Skronker can only be so effective after all. At least thanks to Stonk, I don’t have to listen to that crap any longer than I have to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Who are you talking to Anon?” Sage suddenly breaks her stunned silence, her anger replaced with confusion.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Goddamn mumbling. Get it together Anon, I swear they’re gonna think you’re one of them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“A-ah no one sorry, I uh-” Nearly spilling my spaghetti, I try to think of an excuse. “Was… practicing my… lines for a… play?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her eyes widen in response, showing a clear interest in my lie. “Oh really? I love plays! What’s it called?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s um… called… Rules of Nature.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">C’mon Anon think.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s about… animals, I think?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her enthusiasm seems to break as her facial expression changes, I can’t tell if it’s confusion or suspicion.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I uhh-I see… You’re in the play but you don’t know what it’s about?” The purple Raptor tilts her head as she tries to decipher my bullshit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck she knows too much! SHUT IT DOWN!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“...Well…. I…-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Uh, can you two stop being gay? I gotta go pee.” Both Sage and I turn towards the desk to see Reeee looking at us rather impatiently and unamused.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“HEHEHEHEHEHEH!!! YEAH! I GATTA GO PEE PEE TOO HAHA!” Trosh chimes in with a level of enthusiasm that can almost be described as ‘feral.’</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sage rests her face in her palm as she tries to find her remaining tolerance to deal with her charges.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Okay, we can go. Stonk, do you need to use the restroom too?” Sage removes her hand and looks at Stonk questioningly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stonk just stares blankly at Sage, completely unfazed by her question.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“STONK NEED TO TAKE BIG FAT POOooooOOOOT!!!!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Errmmmhhh.. Okay then, hopefully, she’s more gentle to Sage than he was to the tard wrangler from earlier.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“A-alrighty, let’s go then!” Sage attempts to shake off her disgust as she tries to put on a more professional face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Almost right on cue, Trosh and Reeee rise from the desk, leaving Stonk alone as she sits at the table, doing her best statue impersonation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Stonk, aren’t you coming?” I ask, also slightly afraid.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“OKAY”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*THUD*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The large clanking of metal and wood fills the classroom as Stonk rises from the chair…. Knocking the entire table down in the process.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“....oh for fuck sake.” I manage to catch Sage whisper as her barely contained rage seeps through.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After a long… and painful ordeal of trying to get the trio of tards to properly use the toilet, and I’m not joking. We actually had to help them go to the bathroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I understand that shouldn’t be saying this due to how much of a tard I am in my own right, but Reeee?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Reeee what the fuck?! Why are you pissing in the sink? The urinals are literally right over there!!.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hahaah yeah but like, wouldn’t it be funny if I used the sink instead?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No Reeee, that’s fucking nasty!! People are supposed to clean their hands in there!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“But… like... Didn’t the Roman Empire used to like… clean their hands with their own pee?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“....Reed what the fuck are you talking about??”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I already told you my name is Reeee, retard.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’m at least thankful that I only had to take Reeee with me into the restroom, I can’t even begin to imagine how painful it must be for Sage to be responsible with Trosh and Stonk. I BARELY survived 3 minutes alone with them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I’m about to learn the answer to my dilemma, I see Trosh fly out of the bathroom, bug-eyed with glee.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“HAHAHAHA, YAAAAA DAT WAS FUN!!! I MAED NEW FWIEND!!!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Following Trish’s deformed twin comes her rotund companion as stomps her way out of the bathroom, her eyes dead-eyed but a smile grew across her face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*THUD* *THUD* *THUD*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“STONK FEEL BETTER!!!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah, well that makes one of us…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The third and final figure that emerges from the bathroom, further strengthens my current statement as I see Sage shaking as she struggles to carry herself out of the bathroom as she tries to regain her breath…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her curls were replaced completely tangled and in tattered messes, her makeup smudged, and the utter dismay placed across her face clearly for all to see.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Are-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Idontwannatalkaboutit” The perturbed raptor spits out with utter defeat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trosh begins to laugh in response as she flails her tiny arms. “HehEhEHeH I FOUND SOME BUGS IN DA TOLIET!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As her body still shakes, her eyes turn towards the trio of tards who have now begun flailing their arms around like a rave of wacky inflatable tube men with Tourettes. Her horror faded into vitriol.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“...Fucking retards…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait…. What?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sage must have noticed the shock on my face as her hateful glare quickly matches my own expression.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“O-oh, I u-uhh… said Beastars!” The androgynous raptor begins to fumble as she lets out a nervous chuckle. “Y-yeah! haha, Beastars, this new anime S-Stella told me to check out!!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I think you just got the biggest ‘get out of jail free card’ right now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No. I heard you loud and clear, Sage.” I put on a stern tone causing Sage to shrink even further. “Frankly, I’m deeply offended that you would refer to our follow classmates as such.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“B-b-b-b-but I-” Sage bumbles as she tries to rack through her tiny brain searching for way to lie her way out of this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What would Mrs. Roberts have to say about you using ableist slurs such as that?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This is the part where Sage falls deathly silent.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“However, I mayyyyyy be willing to look the other way, if you could do a little something for me.” I shoot the violet-accented raptor a sly look.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ewwww, I am not gonna su-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait what, WHAT?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What the fuck?? No, eww.. I was gonna say you to let me go for the rest of the day.” I nearly gag as the words leave my mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Raptor Jesus… This is the first thing that comes to this girl’s mind???</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Closing her eyes, Sage takes a deep breath before addressing me okay. “Okay Anon, you win. You’re free to go.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Let’s fucking go!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Thank you very much, Sage! I wish you good luck for the remainder of the period.” I say with an inflection that’s snootier than my Ptero GF.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sage just grumbles in response as she gathers the rest of the tards as she tries to herd them back to the classroom on her own.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A part of me does feel bad about it, leaving her to look after those…. Three...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But then I also remember being thrown through a door after swatting a mosquito in front of the poster child of why women shouldn’t drink when they’re pregnant. So I don’t feel as bad.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, I guess I got some time to kill since school should be done in about 40 minutes. I think I might try to set up that Rock Ring session with the gang after all, hell I’ll even invite that little trigger too!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I whip out my phone as I type away a text message to my girlfriend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">(Me) hey fang, do you reed and trish wanna play some vidya in a bit? I’ve got the per-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But before I can finish the rest of my message. A shrill grating cacophony of gurgling and shrieking begins to flood the halls as the main entrance’s door swings open, the doors revealing…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What. The. Actual. Fuck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">From far away, I would say the monochromatic pterodactyl in front of me is Fang. But her snoot is horribly misaligned as her toothy grin reveals a set of teeth that share an uncanny resemblance to a porpoise.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another pair of familiar faces accompany the homunculus of Fang. On her left, I would say it would be Naomi, but the other noticeable feature on her face is virtually the complete lack of features other than her wall-eyed expression.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">On her right is what I would assume to be Rosa, she’s wearing the same outfit in everything but…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Okay... Rosa may be a big girl, but she’s not THAT big, but before I am able to analyze Poot, Rosa’s long-lost sister, another figure enters my peripheral vision, grabbing my attention away completely.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What in the name of all that is holy?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Behind the trio of Looney Tunes rejects lies a… Well, what I assume to be a dark grey Pterodactyl adorned with an orange crest and misaligned wings.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, sweet Raptor Jesus, Naser what have they done to you?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rather than his formal outfit and Kanye sneakers. This ‘Naser’ is wearing only a green shirt and brown pants, his clubbed feet exposed as he begins to flail around in an excited manner as he squeals only one word.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“NNUUUUSSSSYYYY!!!!!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">….I need to get the hell out of here fast before Sage drags me back...</div>
