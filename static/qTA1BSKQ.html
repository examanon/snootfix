Almost.  There was one person that was aware of her powers, but she didn’t fully comprehend the extent of what she could do.  However, on this fateful day, others would finally realize what she could really do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The cheerful Rosa was having a pretty good day at school.  She had passed the test she was worried about and spring break was about to start.  However, she noticed that her stegosaurus friend was not present.  “Is she sick?  I wonder what’s up with her?  Haven’t heard anything from her for 2 days now.”  As sixth period ended, she got a text message on her phone.  “I have something amazing to show you, friend!  Come by my house after school. ~ Stella-Chan”  Rosa was shocked to see such a message out of the blue, so she responded back immediately.  “Where have you been?  And you know I have to tend the garden.  I really don’t want to leave early, but… are you okay?”  A few seconds later, she got a reply.  “I’m doing better than ever.  Trust me when I say that this is even more important than the garden.  You won’t regret it when you finally come by. ^_^ ~ Stella-Chan”  Rosa wasn’t the type to shirk on her responsibilities, but she loved her friend.  If there was anything she could do to help her, she would.  Luckily, Stella’s home was within walking distance of Volcano High, so the journey was not difficult, even for a husky triceratops.  “That Stella is one funny chica.  She’s gone for 2 days, then invites me over for a surprise?  Sometimes I just don’t get her.”  As she reached the front door, she knocked and waited for a response.  After a few seconds of waiting, nothing happened.  “¿Pero por qué?  She invited me over.  What’s going on.  I wonder if….”  Rosa then grabbed the handle and realized it wasn’t locked.  Entering the house, she noticed that the front room was dark and empty.  She had been there before, but it never looked this abandoned.  “Her parents aren’t home either?  I guess they’re at work now.  I bet she’s in her room.”  Heading towards Stella’s room, Rosa heard the faint sound of music in the background with Stella singing.  “Dakedo yappari.... kininaru…” Rosa giggled.  “More of her Japonés karaoke?  Heh, I guess she wanted to show me her new song and was too busy practicing to hear me.”  Relieved that her friend was okay, Rosa opened the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella was incredibly excited to see her friend.  “Uwaa!  It’s Rosa.  Okaeri nassai!  I’ve been waiting on you~~~” As the triceratops saw the cheerful girl, she was happy at first, then grew concerned.  “Wait… if you’re not sick, why did you miss 2 days of school?  All of this for your knew song?”  Stella laughed at the incorrect deduction.  “Ohohoho… it’s not just the song.  I was working on a special project.  I learned a new magical technique and it will change everything.”  Rosa frowned.  “More of your black magic?  You need to be careful with that kind of thing.”  A smile grew across Stella’s face.  “Don’t worry, this spell will help people.  Allow me to explain.  You know what season it is, right?”  Rosa looked confused.  “Uh… spring, but what does that have to do with anything?”  Stella shook her head.  “Close, but that’s not what I meant.  It’s…. Estrus season!  And you always look so lonely working in the garden.  So I got an idea.  After researching some more powerful techniques, I can solve your lack of a mate.”  Rosa laughed.  “So you spent all this time trying to find me a boyfriend?  That’s nice, but…”  Stella wagged her finger.  “No, something even better.  The solution was in front of you all along.  Check this out!  Dai Henshin!”  With that cheerful declaration, Stella spun around.  During the spin, she took off her shorts and revealed her underwear to her friend.  Rosa was confused and a little uncomfortable as she saw the girl spinning in place to undress.  “Stella.  I’m going to be serious for a bit.  I may not have a boyfriend, but that doesn’t mean that I want a girlfri-” before she could finish her thoughts, she noticed something important.  As Stella stopped spinning once the sequence was over and returned to standing still, Rosa finally saw the bulge in her striped blue panties.  “Oh…. What in God’s name is that huge thing!?”  Stella raised a finger to the air and started spinning it.  “Pi puri pi puri pa pe po!  That’s the magic spell to become the Rebis; the Divine hermaphrodite.  I saw it in a doujinshi and thought that it might work in real life, too.  I was a little worried at first, but I consulted my deck and drew this.”  From between her breasts, she pulled out a card.  “Arcana Number 1: The Magus.  It represents incredible potential.  With that being revealed to me, I knew I had to try it.”  Rosa’s eyes widened in shock.  “You just… kept that card in your bosom?  I don’t remember you being this… naughty.”  Stella looked down at Rosa’s thighs and began to shudder with lust.  “The spell… changed a lot of things.  I’ve always liked you, but we might as well make it official now.  After all, aren’t we the best of friends?”   Rosa backed away from the horny stegosaurus.  “It’s just not right.  Two women can’t be together.  That’s an abomination!”  Stella then pulled down her panties, revealing her massive reptilian cock.  “But that’s the thing.  I’m not exactly a woman anymore.  I’m what some would call… a futanari.  It’s like Viper GTS.  The angels were futanari.  You like angels, right?”  Rosa looked very annoyed at that comment.  “You know, statements like that are not really helping your argument.  Some of your hobbies are a little worri-”  While Rosa was reacting to the remark, the scent of pheromones began to spread through the room.  The unique musk of Stella’s genitals entered her friend’s nostrils and something changed.  The triceratops stopped talking and began to feel a heat within her loins.  She saw the glistening shine of her friend’s penis and couldn’t ignore it.  Licking her lips, she stopped walking backwards in an attempt to escape and just sat still looking at her instead.  Stella let out a giggle.  “Think of it like this.  A woman can’t fertilize you, but I could if I wanted to.  So it’s just like being with a man, right?  You’ll get all of the love and affection from your best friend and maybe even kids one day.  Isn’t that what you want?”  Rosa looked sad for a second, but then began to think.  Guys weren’t really interested in her since she spent so much time gardening.  She had been feeling horny because of the Estrus season, but tried to ignore it, abstaining from sexual thoughts via prayer.  However, bearing witness to a dick staring her in the face, she couldn’t help but have her urges return.  “Ay, dios mio… perdóname…”  She removed the crucifix from around her neck and put it in her pocket.  “So… how does this even work?  I don’t know what to do.”  Stella walked towards Rosa and placed a hand on her face.  “Don’t look so sad.  I’ve read enough books to know the basics.  First, take off your shirt and pants.”  Rosa accepted her words and began to undress.  No one had ever seen her like this before, so she couldn’t help but blush.  Stella began to look up and down her body.  “Ooh, very nice.  Black panties.  Not as sexy as my shimapan, but still pretty good.  Your boobs look a lot bigger like this, too.”  Rosa’s face became even more red from this declaration.  “Oh…. Thank you.  So do I just…” Stella looked at the confused girl and continued rubbing her face.  “Sit down on the bed.”  Still nervous, Rosa heeded her words and began to move towards Stella’s bed.  Her gait showed that she was unsure of what was to come, but she couldn’t stop now.  Her lower parts were burning with anticipation.  Stella stared at her friend’s behind and started drooling.  “Oshiri…” Barely able to contain herself, Stella took off her shirt and bra.  Sitting down on the bed with Rosa, she began unhooking her bra for her.  Rosa had finally stopped looking sad.  Leaning towards her, Stella initiated a kiss.  Rosa was still a little scared, but ultimately accepted. The two locked lips and learning the taste of one another. “See, that wasn’t so bad, right?”  Rosa’s mood suddenly changed once the kiss registered in her mind.  “Y-yeah, it was actually pretty nice.  So now… can I touch it?”  Rosa looked down at the throbbing member of her friend, being far more open to the concept than just a few moments earlier.  “Be my guest!”  With that confirmation, Rosa slowly motioned her head towards her friend’s crotch.  The penis was practically staring her in the face, so she couldn’t help but respond.  First, she grabbed it softly with her right hand.  Stella shuddered once more.  “Uoooh… that feels good.  But can you lick it?”  Rosa was caught up in the moment, so she didn’t even think about it.  The tip of her tongue touched the head of Stella’s cock and then the triceratops was immediately hooked.  She quickly wrapped the entire length of her tongue around it and began motioning up and down while she moved her hand towards the testicles and began to lightly squeeze.  She had never felt like this before and was enamored with the taste and smell of the whole thing.  Stella jumped in place a bit.  “Owo, you’re good at this.  Allow me to reward you.”  She then moved her hand towards Rosa’s crotch.  Inserting her hand between the thick thighs of the triceratops and into her panties, she started to rub on the clitoris of her lover.  Rosa couldn’t believe this feeling of ecstasy she was experiencing.  It was like nothing she ever even knew was possible.  Not thinking about it, she began to squeeze down harder on Stella’s balls.  “Wait!  You’re gonna make me squirt everywhere if you grip me like that!  Let’s get to the real thing now.  Take your panties off and get on all fours.”  Rosa was really into the blowjob, but listened to her friend anyway since she wanted to see what she had in mind.  Taking off her panties, she got into position for penetration.  Staring at the Mexican girl’s huge ass, Stella’s own pussy began to get wet as well.  Getting on her knees, she grabbed her penis with her right hand and put her left on the hip of her partner.  After having the surrounding area of her vagina rubbed by the reptilian dong, Rosa began to wiggle around a bit in place.  It tickled, but she really wanted this, so she tried her best to sit still for the insertion.  After a bit more fiddling around with the orifice, Stella finally managed to get it inside. “¡Ay, carajo!  It’s so big!”  Stella smiled “Well I am the supreme magus of Volcaldera Bluffs, so this was to be expected.”  Rosa sighed.  “I’m just going to pretend I know what you’re talking about.  Anyway, just keep going.”  Stella understood what her friend meant, so she grabbed both of her hips now and started thrusting in and out.  The meat of her backside kept jiggling and smacking against Stella’s pelvis.  The sight of this made her even more excited than before.  Pheromones now encased the entire room.  The scent of Rosa’s pussy was affecting Stella as well, so she just started pounding harder and harder.  The pair both let out yelps of pleasure as they continued.  As the excitement grew, Rosa couldn’t stop fidgeting around again.  Her tail started moving around like crazy and she accidentally hit Stella in the face with it.  “Itai!  Careful with that!”  Rosa felt her embarrassment coming back.  “Sorry about that!  I was just losing it from how you were making me feel.”  Stella rubbed the area where she was hit, then pulled her penis out of the sopping pussy.  “Don’t worry about it.  Actually, you know what?  Let’s try a different position.  Get on your back and spread your legs.”  Rosa, still wanting more, obeyed without question.  She got into position and began to spread her pussy with her fingers.  “¡Vamanos!  Let’s continue!”  Stella, not wanting to disappoint her, immediately jammed it in.  The second penetration left Rosa with another spark of ecstasy, so she couldn’t help but pull her partner in closer.  Grabbing onto her back, Stella was right in Rosa’s face now, so they shared yet another kiss.   This time, it was much more intense than before.  Rosa suddenly had her hands around the back of Stella’s head so she couldn’t escape.  Their tongues were daring back and forth between each others’ mouths and neither of them could stop.  This is all while Stella continued to move her lower half violently, becoming drunk on the juices of both her friend’s upper and lower mouths.  Stella also experienced the aftertaste of her cock juices from the tongue of her partner.  At this point, she was going nuts from her own pheromones, even.  This ecstasy pushed her to thrust even harder.  Rosa didn’t want the feeling to end, so she wrapped her legs around Stella, locking her into place.  Anyone that could view this would be in awe of the Stegosaurus’ smaller, but perky bottom shaking as her pelvis kept smacking against the soft, tender thighs of her partner as they shook from the impact.  Rosa felt like she was about to pass out, however, so the triceratops was forced to finally release Stella from her grip and get some air.  Now breathing heavily, she could hardly think.  Stella had a look of pure lust on her face, as if her pupils were becoming like hearts.  “My hips are moving on their own!  Hehehe….”  She always wanted to say that.  Grabbing onto the breasts of her partner, she gave them a good squeeze as milk began to leak from them, followed by Rosa yelping louder than before.  “¡Te quiero!”  Rosa was usually a good girl.  She didn’t even masturbate, so this kind of pleasure was unknown to her.  As such, she didn’t realize that she having an orgasm, as she didn’t really know what an orgasm was.  Her vagina began to squirt fluid everywhere, showering Stella’s member with a heat and wetness that she didn’t know was possible as she was being squeezed by the walls to an absurd degree.  “I-iku!  Nakadashi!!!!”  As Stella yelled out more of the words she learned from her doujinshi collection, she began to shudder harder than ever before.  She did one last long thrust to put herself balls deep inside of Rosa, rubbing against her cervix.  Her dick began twitching, then she unleashed the deluge of semen.  The output was massive, to the point that it started leaking from the sides before Stella could even pull out.  As the ejaculation ended, Stella finally removed her penis from the orifice and laid next to her partner.  Rosa moaned as the excess semen gushed out, as her insides were absolutely caked with white fluid.  “Wow… that was not the kind of surprise I was expecting, Stella.  But I must say, that was really nice.”  Her friend giggled at the comment.  “Thanks.  You were pretty good, too.  I was going nuts waiting on you, so I’m glad you came.”  With that comment, Stella burst out laughing.  Rosa looked confused.  “I don’t get it, what’s so funny?”  Stella leaned over towards her lover and patted her head.  “It’s nothing.  Anyway, this bed is a mess now.”  The pair looked down at the sheets.  Their juices had covered the bed.  White and clear fluid had pooled all around the area and was seeping into the mattress.  Rosa perked up.  “Wow, that’s a lot of stuff.  So, do you think I’m gonna…. Have babies?”  Stella nodded.  “With my powerful magic, I’m almost sure of it.  I think you’ll make a great mommy, too.  You already have the body for it.”  Rosa blushed.  “Stop it, you’re embarrassing me…”  Her friend let out another laugh.  “Oh, I get it.  That’s pretty funny.  Embarrassing?  Like embarassada?  I remember you taught me that word!  See, you’re funny, too.”  She rolled her eyes.  “Ehh, close enough.  But how is this gonna work out?  So you’re mama number 2?  What are we going to tell people?”  Stella put her hand on her chin and thought for a second.  “Well I don’t think it matters too much what people think.  You and I aren’t really that popular to begin with and our friends will still like us, I bet.  As long as we have a healthy child and raise them with lots of love and affection, that’s all that really matters, right?”  Rosa nodded in approval.  “I guess so.  But let’s worry about that later.  How about we enjoy spring break together…. As a couple!”  Stella sprang up in excitement at the statement.  “Sure thing, girlfriend!  But let’s get cleaned up first.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">A week later, school started back up.  The two dinosaurs walked back into Volcano High together, holding hands.  Rosa was a little scared of doing this at first, but Stella helped her practice.  “See, I told you.  No one cares.  It’s just like Koakuma Kanojo!” Rosa nodded, trying to focus on looking forward.  “If you say so.  Oh look, there’s Anon.  He’s headed this way.  What should we do?”  Stella looked at her lovingly and said “Well I actually do want to show him something.”  As the pair approached the person in question, Stella stopped him.  “Hi, Anon.  How was your break?  Did it go like I told you I predicted it would a while back?  With the new shoes?”  Anon looked down and remembered that he did in fact get new shoes.  “Well yeah, but my old ones were kind of beat up to begin with.  I never got why you thought that drawing your Pocket Raptor would let you do mag-” He suddenly noticed how big Rosa’s stomach was.  He remember her being a little chubby, but not like this.  “Uh… is everything alright with you two?”  Stella began to laugh.  “Ohohohoho.  You doubted my potency, but now I’ve proven it in more ways than one.  I got Rosa pregnant!  She’s going to have my baby soon.  We did it over spring break after I performed a spell that granted me a futanari transformation.”  Anon looked at her with a very disturbed face.  “Uh… Stella, I think it’s time to lay off of the Chinbotsu stuff.  But still, I thought you meteo- uh…. Dinos laid eggs.”  Stella giggled.  “Why do you think it’s called magic?  Because it’s mundane?”  Rosa began to blush.  “Si...  She has a real way with words, so I fell in love…”  Anon looked even more confused since he saw Rosa indulge in Stella’s antics.  “Rosa, you’re in on this, too?  But… pregnancy doesn’t show up that fast.”  Stella couldn’t stop laughing.  “Anon, I just told you.  It’s magic!  Do you finally understand?”  He nodded in acceptance.  “Uh… yeah, alright.  Well then… have a nice day I guess.”  With that said, he quickly walked away from the pair.  Rosa still looked a bit concerned.  “Stella… I think you scared him.”  She rubbed her lover’s face.  “Don’t worry.  He was just in awe of… the saikou no majutsushi.”  Rosa began to smile.  “Jajaja, whatever you say…. Girlfriend.”</div>
