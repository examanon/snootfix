mous</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Instead you were just another loner, invisible to the world around you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon Incognito</div><div class="fanfic-line">>So invisible no one even cared or noticed you were a skinny</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As the bell rang you quickly grabbed your backpack and filled in with the rest of the sea of students of volcano high.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You had only one class left before dismissal and just wanted to get home and play some vidya</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your locker was at the ass end of the school that was semi-deserted so you didn't have to deal with anyone else and could get your books peacefully</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One of the few blessings given to you as you just wanted to be alone most days</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The other days you wished you had a GF</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...At this point, you'd even take a meteor dodger</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As you turned around a corner there were a few people in front of your locker</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You were a little nervous as a couple of them looked like triggas</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You ducked out of sight behind the corner and scope it out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There were 2 of these aggressive, troubled inner city youth</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As one of them shuffled to the side you now had a full view of the cutest girl you've seen in volcano high.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was wearing this hipster style outfit of overalls over a t-shirt but she made it work and some big round glasses that just complimented her nerdy and shy demeanor</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Holding her books up to her chest she was obviously frightened as the size difference between her and the triggers was apparent</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As the one on the left raised his voice you were able to catch a few words</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Well you're not gonna be able to do anything without these!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Taking the glasses from her face they laughed as she tried to take them back</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This was really starting to get under your skin, glasses were expensive and these hoodlums weren't gonna pay for them If they broke them that was for sure</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As they dropped her glasses and looked like they were gonna step on them your body moved by itself around the corner</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh shit</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Making a loud couple of first steps to get their attention they froze</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ok good all you had to do was go around them get your stuff from your locker and hopefully they would leaving knowing a witness was there watching them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Haha yeah</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>So why were your feet taking you TOWARDS THEM!?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh shit</div><div class="fanfic-line">"H-hey leave them alone"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>.....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>........</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After a period of silence they both burst out laughing right in your face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh man this wasn't gonna go well at all</div><div class="fanfic-line">>???</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not a lot of profit, mostly just darkness</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"H-hey are you alright"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Opening your eyes you groaned and rolled onto your side</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking up you could see the girl kneeling next to you with worried look on her face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"That was a pretty stupid move to make for a skinny"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Thinking back on it you kinda forgot the series of events that led to you getting beat up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Did you call him a trigga out loud or was that just in your head?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sighing it didn't matter much cause in the end you still lost that fight</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But looking around you were able to spot why you did this in the first place</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Getting up with a groan you fetched her glasses from the ground and held them out for her</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I think these are yours right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"O-oh y-yeah thanks for that"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Taking the glasses from your hand she put them back on her face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Did you have a glasses fetish or was she just that cute wearing them?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>.....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Ahem”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh crap you’re staring, and maybe even blushing</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So uhh why were those guys messing with you?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sighing she leaned against the lockers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”It's a long story but basically his sister’s in my class and to keep her from failing he has me do all her homework, on top of letting her copy my notes in class”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wow, fucking triggers</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I'm guessing you stopped huh?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Y-yeah i guess i finally grew a bit of a pair, huh, haha”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sharing a awkward laugh you smiled at her meekness</div><div class="fanfic-line">>....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>.....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Uhhh what do i say? It's been forever since you had an IRL conversation</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Uhhh name’s Anon”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>’Like an idiot you held your hand out for a hand shake</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Oh, how formal”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Smiling she moved a hand free from her books and took your hand gently in hers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Sage. Thank you for rescuing this damsel in distress, Anon”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Starting to blush you placed a hand behind your head and laughed embarrassed</div><div class="fanfic-line">“W-well I-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>BBBBBRRRRRIIIINNNNNGGGGG</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your thoughts were cut by the ringing of the bell, signaling that you were late</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Oh crap”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Oh crap”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>speaking in unison at the same time you said your goodbyes while turning away from each other</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“I’ll see you around, Sage”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”I’ll see you around, Anon”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hustling over to your Locker you started working on your lock while smiling despite the pain still in your body from getting beat up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You got to talk to a girl today</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A gorgeous angel, and her name was Sage</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It had been a week since you met Sage and over the weekend all you could think about was her as you sat in your history class</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your seat was in the back corner next to the windows</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When you first picked this desk you wanted to feel like an anime protagonist</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But now it just feels cringy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Especially of anyone found out that's why you picked it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your thoughts returned to Sage</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The purple-haired angel</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your daydreaming was cut short by your substitute teacher for the day Mr. Carldewskii raising his voice to be heard over the class’ talking</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Alright pipe down ya bunch ah freakin dino dumb dumbs, I dont have anything for you’s to do so we're gonna wheel in the TV and put on some crappy freaking documentary"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As the class let out a cheer and started talking you cracked a smile yourself</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"HEY, I'm still freaking talking here pipe down. One more thing is we got a new student switching classes, so ya this is Sage, whatever it don't matter, none of this matters. Now sit down"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking at the front of the class you had to pinch yourself to see if you were dreaming</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You must be still dreaming</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Ouch”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Giving yourself a quick pinch it confirmed that nope this was not a dream at all</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Walking sheepishly down your row Sage looked from left to right for a open desk</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking to your right you saw one of the quiet kids napping on his desk</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Crap, the only other free desk is on the other side of class</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>.....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Quickly reaching over you swiftly pushed him out of his chair</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As he hit the ground he didn't wake up, still softly snoring</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Thank the cross of rock, it was a dick move but you'd make it up to him, somehow, later</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sighing in relief you raised hand to catch Sage’s attention</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As he eyes focused on you she smiled</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Pointing to the empty chair beside you she nodded and quickly moved to take her seat</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Seeing the smile on her face brought a smile to yours until you looked forward to the class</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You could only see Mr. Carldewskii staring at you and shaking his head</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh crap, he must have seen you push that guy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Or maybe he was shaking his head ‘cause you were simping?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As Sage sat down she looked at you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”H-hi, Anon”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Uh h-hi, Sage”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Swallowing nervously you both looked back towards the front of the class as Mr.Carldewskii was messing with the VCR trying to get it to work, cursing up a storm while doing so</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>.....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh crap another IRL interaction and you had no idea what to say</div><div class="fanfic-line">>....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ok, let's just not overthink it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ya overthinking can be bad so let's just go with our moment in the gut</div><div class="fanfic-line">>....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You meant go with your gut in the moment, damn brain</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Sooo uhh, Sage, what brings you to history?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Well i just thought since I couldn't handle having to do someone's else's homework twice and be bullied for it I’d switch classes”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“And you can do that? Just switch classes?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Well it's still early in the semester so it's not that much trouble, but… that's kinda why you saw me getting bullied in the hallway that day”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”They found out about me wanting to transfer and wanted to intimidate me into not doing that, and honestly they were succeeding, until well…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Until?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sage was starting to blush a little as she looked down</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”W-well ‘til you stepped in and helped me out, after that i really wanted to switch classes, so one day i followed you to your classes to see which ones had a spot open and I would like! So here I am in history”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Wait so you were stalking me?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The smile on her face quickly vanished as her cheeks flared up beet red from embarrassment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”I-I-I m-mean w-w-w n-not e-exactly I-I was just m-more like u-uh w-well OBSERVING! Y-yes I was merely observing you from afar, withoutyouknowknowingcauseyouknowthedifferencebetweenobservingfromafarcomparedtostalking is-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You laughed and proceeded to cut off her run-on sentence</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“It's okay i was just joking, and even if you were stalking me, I feel flattered. Never had a stalker before.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Laughing with you, Sage smiled</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”That face when no stalker GF”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That stopped you in your tracks</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Y-you wouldn't happen to be a fellow memer extremer on a certain mongolian basket weaving forum would you?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Freezing up she looked at you then started stammering</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”N-no not really… unless you happened to peruse a certain bolivian pot sculpting forum”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh you're talking about the Tibetan Throatsinging Swedish Dalahästpainting Libanese Cooking forum?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Nope more like the Luxemburgian Racing</div><div class="fanfic-line">Peruvian Knitting forum"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking at Sage as she looked at you, you both shared a smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Best day ever</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">—4 weeks later—</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It had been a couple of weeks since you and Sage became friends and everyday you got closer</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Just hanging out in class or outside was amazing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was incredibly smart so class was always a breeze if you needed help and you both shared a lot of the same interests</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Whether its video games, movies or fandoms, you had a lot in common</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Especially anime</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Of all the things you shared with Sage your love of romcoms was the most embarrassing to tell</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But after calling each other’s waifus and taste in shows shit you both decided to give each other’s favorites a try</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Matter of fact you were on your way to Sage’s place right now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your place wasn't a option, but Sage made the suggestion of hers, sooooo yeah you were now walking to a girls house</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well a dino girl</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not that it matters to you but some people might have a problem with that</div><div class="fanfic-line">>.....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Like your family for starters</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But fuck them, they don't need to know</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Checking your phone you made sure you were in the right area</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was long walk, but worth it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Nice neighborhood</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Once you rounded a corner and saw Sage’s house number you paused and leaned next to an unlit street lamp to help you think</div><div class="fanfic-line">>First time in a girl’s house, gotta make a good impression on the family</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Don't be weird”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Like talking out loud, don't do that its weird</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Walking up to Sage’s house you gave a firm knock in a rhythmic pattern</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Tap tap tap tap tap… knock knock”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>......</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You got a little nervous as you waited</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You were about to knock again when a beautiful velociraptor girl opened the door</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”O-oh dear sorry to have made you wait, i was just getting ready for work”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“O-oh its no problem at all i mean-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Anon, that you?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking around the girl you saw Sage and gave a little wave</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Hey Sage, you didn't tell me you had a cute sister”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Blushing she raised a hand to her mouth</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”O-oh my…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Hey that's my mom stay away from her”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Laughing at Sage’s jealousy you thanked her mom for letting you in and took off your shoes and entered their humble abode</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Be me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And you were currently in Sage’s living room on a couch watching anime together</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now you would never be caught dead watching anime in such a public space as a living room with the tv speakers on and everything</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But Sage insisted on it since her mother works late nights sometimes on weekends</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was just you and Sage all alone on the couch together</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You asked her mom as she was leaving if it was really okay for you be alone with Sage ‘cause I mean Sage is a girl, what kind of mom would leave a girl all alone with a boy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But she just laughed and said it would be fine</div><div class="fanfic-line">>So here you were all alone and watching some Shounen anime with a qt dino girl</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Lookin over to your right you started to really notice Sage’s outfit</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She has on some really short shorts and and tank top really showing off her flat chest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Unf, you had a thing for flat chests</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her butt was hidden under the cushions but her thighs were exposed as well as her feet as her slippers were off</div><div class="fanfic-line">>UNF</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You were having a hard time paying attention to the tv as your slowly rising penis started to strain against your pants</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”So how’d you like that episode An…on?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking over to you, you were so caught up in your staring you didn't have time to look away, a bright blush on your face exposing just what you were doing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking down and seeing the your bulging crotch she blushed and looked away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“I-Im sorry it’s just-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”N-no it's okay really, I mean… I’m flattered”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There was some awkward silence between you two before Sage spoke up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”S-so you really like me that much, Anon?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Ah, y-yeah I really do sage”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Smiling, Sage leaned over and started crawling over to you on all four</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”You ever kiss someone before, Anon?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You felt a little embarrassed that you never have before but decided to be honest as it felt the most natural</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“N-no, I guess”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Me neither”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Leaning forward you brought a hand to Sage’s cheek as she nuzzled her beak against your cheek</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her smooth scales felt good against your skin</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It took a lot of trial and error and watching a few videos on Skinned.cum to really understand what you were doing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But after some back and forth your mouths were pushed together with tongues rubbing in each others mouths</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sliding a hand under Sage’s tank top you started cupping her breast and caressing her nipple between your hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Breaking the kiss to let out a soft moan, Sage buried her head into your shoulder</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Seeing your chance you leaned in and started placing kisses along her neck</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Laughing she pushed you away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You couldn't help but laugh yourself a bit</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking at you Sage tilted her head down at your crotch and smugly smirked</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”C-could we try what we saw in that video we watched?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Video? You mean the- ohhh”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Nodding she got to her knees in between your legs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”C-could you call me a slut?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“What?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Just… Please?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As Sage looked away shyly you grinned and complied</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Kinky</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“You're such a slut aren't you?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Smiling sheepishly she nodded and hooked her fingers under your waistband and slowly slid both your pants and underwear down in one swift motion</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your erect cock immediately sprung forth once freed, stopping Sage in surprise</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Y-you’re pretty big”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The complement stroked your ego pretty good</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As Sage slowly place her hand on your cock you gasped at the new extraordinary feeling of someone else touching your most sensitive part</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As she slowly pumped her hand up and down on your shaft, you tilted your head back and started breathing quicker and more heavy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”You make some pretty cute sounds, Anon”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Y-yea just wait ‘til its my turn, Sage”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Feeling her hand leave your cock you looked down thinking you said something wrong only to see Sage removing her glasses and brushing the hair out of her eyes as hovered her mouth over your cock</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A tinge of excitement but both fear went through you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>S-she's gonna be careful with that beak right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As she lowered her herself onto you engulfing your cock into her warm wet mouth you groaned and sunk into the couch</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As Sage went to work on your cock bobbing her head up and down you looked a the door and noticed that if Sage’s mom was to return you would be in full view of her daughter sucking your cock</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It might have been weird but the idea kinda got you going</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Grabbing Sage’s head you started to thrust yourself down her throat as you got closer to your orgasm</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sage was a little surprised at first but soon let your hands do all the work as your cock violated her throat with every motion</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You've had fantasies about this moment with Sage but to have it actually happen is too much as a familiar pressure built up inside you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“S-Sage i-im gonna cum”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Placing her hands on your thighs she started to go along with your movements</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was too much and with a loud groan you dug your nails into Sage’s head and buried her face into your crotch as your cock shot rope after rope of hot cum down her throat</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Keeping Sage’s face attached your crotch you rode out your orgasm moaning loudly like the virgin you were from the ecstasy before leaning back into the couch and releasing Sage</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When your hands were no longer keeping her down she sprung up coughing trying to catch her breath</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Both breathing heavily you looked down at Sage and could almost see hearts in her pupils</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That was amazing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A little too amazing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Hey Sage were you… practicing this before”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Snapping out of her sexual haze and blushing when she meteor eye she looked away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”W-well i mean not really, just maybe a little bit with popsicles, long vegetables and maybe my ‘toy’...”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You couldn't help but laugh a little as Sage’s cute face blushed a deep crimson</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sliding forward you pushed Sage onto her back</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”W-wait wha-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“I did say just wait till its my turn”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Grinning at Sage she held her hands up to her chest in embarrassment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“Can I return the favor sage?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking away she smiled sheepishly and quietly whispered</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Y-yes please, Anon”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The way she said please set something off in you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You wanted to pleasure her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As you reached your hands up and placed them on the waistband of her shorts you stopped noticing the small bulge in her crotch area</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>T-that's just a puffy vagina right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As you slid down her shorts and revealed her pink panties you noticed the bulge more predominantly straining against the tight undergarments</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I-it's just a puffy dinosaur vagina, right!?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Swallowing some saliva you pulled down “her”(?) panties revealing a small but very easy to see dino cock and balls</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>.....</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As the cool temperature clashed with the warm body heat of “her”, no, “his” cock it twitched</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”W-well Anon quit teasing me, or are you gonna have me beg for it you-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“You’re a guy?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>...</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Pausing in his tracks Sage looked at you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Well yeah i mean couldn't you tell it was-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“N-no i couldn't just “tell” with a lot of you guys it's hard to tell”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Standing up you immediately felt so disgusting</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”B-but what about us?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN US!?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Getting a little startled from the raising of you voice he continued</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”W-well we have so much in common and i was really enjoying the time we spent together and i j-just thought that…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“That was i was a fag!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Sage winced at your words</div><div class="fanfic-line">>“I-I can't believe this, I gotta go”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Zipping yourself back up you tried to leave but a hand grabbing your arm stopped you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>”Anon wait I wasn't trying to trick you or anything, I swear I thought you knew I-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Turning around you pushed Sage with enough force to send him on his ass</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking up at you
