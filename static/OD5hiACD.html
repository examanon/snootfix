You're an amazing bro, I'd even... go as far as to think of you as a brother, man..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon notices Naser's voice crack a bit at the mention of considering him a brother.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His glare softens seeing Naser open up this way with him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He smiles at Naser.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I love you, bro. I'd call you a brother too."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Naser looks at Anon, completely silent.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even after all of the questionable shit, Anon thinks of him as a brother.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"God dammit."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon pulls Naser into a side hug, patting his head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon chuckles a bit at Naser's breakdown.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You're a big baby sometimes, you know? Don't change, man."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They both laugh after a bit of a tearful moment. Calming down, they both get back onto the road, listening to tunes all the way.</div>
