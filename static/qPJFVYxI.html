class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Anonymous</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley died in the line of duty.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You attend the funeral to pay your respects.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He was your mentor, the father-figure you never had growing up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You approach his wife to give your condolences and tell her how much he meant to you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She invites you over for dinner to share stories.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You have fun with her family as they warmly accept you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At first it was awkward, but her daughter had a human boyfriend, so you didn't feel out of place for long.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At some point it became a regular thing for you to come visit and hang out with your new...family?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You didn't come from a good home so it was already pretty crazy that you became a cop.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But Ripley saw potential in you and set you straight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His kids are already calling you "uncle."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>His wife, on the other hand, had other plans for you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You were a lot like him, a bit softer around the edges, but he was your role model.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And she was lonely and needy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Who were you to deny a woman in need?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You weren't Ripley.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But you weren't just his replacement either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She assured you of that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It had to be hidden, at first.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley was the Police Commissioner afterall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And he was well loved.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But it was no secret that you were his protégé.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There were rumors, of course.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And that carried a certain thrill.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Which translated well into the bedroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was older than you, but she didn't act like it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was insatiable.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was ravenous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And she always demanded more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And you were always more than willing to give it to her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Every night she would scream your name.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Every night you were grateful that her children were grown and gone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But secrets weren't meant to last.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your future stepson had time off from his classes to come visit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Since her daughter still lived in the city, it was a good opportunity to let them know.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Dinner with Samantha, Naser, and Lucy became awkward again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not because you were the only human present.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But because you knew their mother biblically.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And some part of you felt that they knew.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe you were overthinking it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But there's something in the way they call you "uncle."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Something in the way they spoke to you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Something in the look in their eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Still, you kept up a casual front.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But you were nervous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Would they accept you?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Could you be a role model for them?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What if they hate you for daring to take their father’s place?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Under the table, Samantha grips your hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She knows you well enough to sense these things.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You take a deep breath.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Of course they’ll accept you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They are already adults.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You aren’t supposed to take their father’s place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Samantha rose from her seat with you following suit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The reaction wasn’t as climactic as you expected.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Your gut was right, they knew.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It was when they started calling you their uncle that they accepted you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Their mother was a wreck when Ripley passed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As much as they loved their mother, they could only do so much.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When your visits became regular occurrences, their mother’s chipper demeanor returned.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley will always have a place in their hearts, but he’s no longer around.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They were a little put off by how quickly everything moved.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But they couldn’t argue with the result.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You brought their mother back.</div>
