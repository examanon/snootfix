A moment passes before an idea thunders into his head</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A golf putter in each hand, Anon drives the head of one into the tree, before using it to hoist himself up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What would he even call this? Ice climbers used ice picks, so maybe he'd have to call this club picking, wood picking, wood clubbing... Whatever</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley's laughter had sputtered out, replaced with a incredulous stare as his mouth gaped at Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon eventually ascends to the branch with his ball, before hitting it out onto the golf green</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The descent was alright, since Anon had premade holes from the climb</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That is, until the tree bark tore off while Anon was using an aforementioned hole with his putter</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon falls squarely on his back, the impact leaving a human shaped indent in the tall grass surrounding the tree</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley just stares at the spot until he sees the human get up and brush off dirt and grass from his outfit</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hole 7, flanked by a busy road</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon asks what the tall netting running parallel to the course is for</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley informs him that it's to prevent golf balls from getting hit into the road traffic</div><div class="fanfic-line">>None the less, Anon manages to slice his ball straight through the single solitary hole in the netting</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A screeching of tires is followed shortly by the sounds of metallic crunching and spraying glass</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And then the gunfire starts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The cars involved in the collision were part of rival gangs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley was not at all looking forward to the stack of paperwork assuredly building on his desk with every bullet that rings out</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hole 8, A long par 5</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley has been getting visibly more frustrated, a cloud of rage hovering over him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The playing field wasn't having much luck against his his anger either, with each swing he takes creating larger and larger clods of grass</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon asks what to do with the excavated pieces of greenery</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley doesn't care, an exasperated tone leaves him before telling Anon to wear it or something</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon dumps all the nearby pieces onto his bald head, before taking out his phone and having a glance through the selfie camera</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A single solitary tear leaves Anon's eye, as he sees himself with his chia pet hair</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A picture is taken, and sent out to his favourite ptero</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's phone cries out in pain as the torrent of received messages push into it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang can't stop herself from expressing her laughter at what Anon sent her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon deflates a bit from the responses, this is not quite how he wanted it to go. He shuffles the idea of hair transplants out of his head and straight into the dumpster</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At least he can take a bit of happiness from making his ptero-GF happy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That and not having to buy shampoo</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The grounds-keeper is less than pleased by the antics however, as he spots the towering mass of grass on top Anon's head</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon deposits the green tower into the grounds-keeper's hands, and continues along the course</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley had taken a picture too. At this point, he needs something to blackmail Anon with so that the truth of this match never becomes public</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hole 9, another hole flanked by another attraction</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's the driving range, which receives another wayward ball from Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon can't quite understand why he keeps slicing the ball. Maybe it has something to do with using his clubs like icepicks on that tree.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon hops the small picket fence separating the two areas from each-other</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Holy shit there's a lot of golf balls here</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon decides that he should stock up a bit while he goes to get his own ball</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As he bends over to pick up a few spares, another lands right by him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Score, more for Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But it doesn't stop there, more and more balls keep landing by Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">>One scores him on his head, finally activating his reptile brain, causing Anon to panic and flee from the torrent of balls now raining down around him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Is this why Ripley comes here so often? To practice his skills as an officer while avoiding this artillery barrage of golf balls?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A loud bang of an engine backfiring interrupts Anon's thoughts, as he turn his head around to reveal what he can only assume is a weird lawnmower with a shielded cabin</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's coming right at him</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon bolts for the fence separator, in hopes that the steel behemoth can't climb. The pounding rain of golf balls was distracted at least, instead choosing to rain down on that monstrosity</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon hops the fence before collapsing, out of breath. He really should cut back on smoking</div><div class="fanfic-line">>At least he has more golf balls</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hole 10</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley is absolutely befuddled as to how he ended up on hole 10, it was supposed to have ended on the last hole. He had sworn himself to it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But Anon was much too quick for him, the next hole being a very short jaunt over</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley takes one last look at the clubhouse behind him, before submitting himself to fate</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon's power drive hits the ball with enormous ferocity, the ball streaking to its target, before hitting the hole's flag and dropping straight down into the cup</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A hole-in-one! Anon could hardly believe his luck</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even Ripley couldn't believe Anon could do it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Especially because the hole it went into was for the 18th</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon swears he can hear the faint sound of glass shattering emanating from Ripley</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley's soul had decided that it needed a time-out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But Ripley's brain rolled into motion, as his enormous hand slapped down onto Anon's shoulder, congratulating him for ending the game</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon is a bit perplexed, he didn't think that getting a hole-in-one would cause the game to end</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ripley resolutely assures him that's the case, removing all doubt from Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The drive back to the Araan's home is silent, save for the sounds of the road and air conditioning</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon thinks back a bit, realizing that it was likely poor form to brag that he had won</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After all, his score was much higher than Ripley's. How does one even go negative anyway?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Upon entering the house, Anon is beset by Fang, a whirl of rainbow and bright flashes assailed him before he could gather his bearings</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon pulls the rug off his head, revealing it to be a rainbow coloured wig that Fang had run out to purchase as soon as see had seen Anon's chia-hair</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The affectionate laughter from Fang soothed his heart however. There was no way he could possibly deny her happiness.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A resounding shudder hits the house, the ring of fine china and crystal calling back to answer, interrupting the both of them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon made his way to the source only to find Samantha on top Ripley's back, his arm pinned behind him, an angry Matriarch staring daggers into her husband</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The sound of a pin dropping could be heard, before the sweating Patriarch posed Anon a question</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Would you like to go golfing next week Anon?"</div>
