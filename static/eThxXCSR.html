                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: A Game Gone Wrong</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang, Naser, Trish, Reed, Naomi, Stella, Rosa</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Examanon</div><div class="fanfic-line">Summary: Stella isekai's the gang into a fantasy story. No sex ensues.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Prologue]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Do we really have to?" Anon asked his ptero girlfriend, with a great deal of anguish in his voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The human could imagine dozens, nay, hundreds of better ways to spend his Friday night than another game night at Stella's. Falling into a coma for instance. Yet they were only minutes away from arriving at the dreaded destination.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, lighten up dork! Last time wasn't that bad."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It wasn't?" he asked in a sarcastic tone "Wow! Could have fooled me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All the response he got was a prominent middle finger.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">His thoughts flew back to the so-called "last time". "Last time" they've spent six excruciating hours trying to start a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, and yet barely managing to even set up characters for everyone. Fang's apparent clinging to make a pirate princess class might have caused that. Stella proved an unbelievably lenient game master to let her do that, though it ended up with them going through four versions of the DM manual from 3.0 onwards, piecing together traits and whatnot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even Anon, accustomed to roleplaying games as he was, found the process incredibly boring. He had no idea how the others tolerated it. Most of the players - him included - chose their classes in mere minutes. He, simpleton of mind, went with warrior. Or maybe it had something to do with him not wanting to dress his character in robes or tight leather like some kind of faggot. Trish, mere seconds after his choice picked warrior as well, proclaiming that they will need someone to actually do the job right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*Fuck you too, Trish* Anon thought at that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before Fang could snatch her away, Stella recommended Naser to be a paladin, so he stuck with that. Rosa eventually became their cleric. Naomi took forever to pick from all of the caster classes, ending up at sorceress. Surprisingly, Reed took his sweet time too, looking at the list of skills and whatnot. Stella told him that he ought to be a rogue, seeing that the party had none. Alas, Reed wanted to be a bard. Anon, understanding the implications of the choice practically felt the inner facepalm of the lime stego. To her credit, she's tried her best to turn Fang's pirate princess into a rogue-ish character. Though by definition it was very hard not to make it into a dashing swordsman, god forbid a party with two bards.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A question arose within Anon. Okay, they've set up the party. But were all the players even gonna be there that night? After the disaster that was their first attempt, he could easily imagine his friends coming up will all sorts of colorful excuses.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Who's coming this time?" he asked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What do you mean? Everyone is." Fang answered, amused at Anon's idea that people would ditch "Not everyone likes to sit at home like you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ow, shots fired."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He tried to play it off casually, but the words got to him. What if he preferred staying at home? There was nothing wrong with that. For the remainder of their short trip, neither of them spoke up. Although it was pretty obvious that Fang was excited, her short tail playing a non-stop beat on the bus seat. It made Anon want to tug on it so badly, but he's learned his lesson on that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Do NOT pull a dino's tail without permission. Especially if it's short. He suspected that there might be some size-queen thing going on with tails, but he never dared to ask. Nonetheless, it was his headcanon that Stella was walking around with the equivalent of double-D funbags. And uh, he did not want to consider Reed on that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Their stop soon came to view, and it was only a couple of blocks to Stella's place from there. It was a nice, quiet neighborhood in the suburbs. Neatly trimmed green grass and hedges as far as the eye could see, a couple of kids still running around despite the sun setting momentarily. It wasn't actually that far from Fang's home either, the only reason they had to take a bus was cause they were ditching the last period to play Xrox, and also very much not to play Xrox, at Anon's shitty apartment on the other side of town.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As they rounded the last corner, Fang suddenly stopped, looking around with an intense look.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Shit!" she exclaimed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What? What is it?" Anon asked nervously.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wasn't there a convenience store somewhere around here? We should like, bring some munchies or something."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That was a fair point. Although Stella was the hostess, it would be rude to arrive without at least some snacks. He had no earthly idea if there was a store nearby though, so he told Fang about that much. A quick look at his watch confirmed that they'd be totally late if they start going in circles now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ugh, whatever then. We'll just say it was your fault for taking so long to get dressed."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon's retort came quick. With Naser there, he definitely did not want to say anything even remotely implying that they've had sex.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, how about we don't do that? I'd prefer not to get beat up by your brother."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Whatever, dweeb. Then make some shit up."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*Easier said than done* he thought, but he didn't object.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In fact, he tried his very best to think his way out of the conundrum all the way up to Stella's front door, to no avail. The doorbell chimed its pleasant tune, and ultimately Anon concluded that the best course of action seemed to be just apologizing, and keeping their reasons for themselves. That should work.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stella! More of your friends are here!" A man's voice came from the inside.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A few seconds later the door opened, and Stella's dad greeted the duo. The best Anon could describe him was "plain". Jeans, a neatly buttoned checkerboard shirt, short hair, framed glasses, clean scales. There was not a single memorable trait about him. They've met him last time too, and at first Anon would not believe he was one of Stella's parents. He imagined the entire family to be into mysticism, spirituality, the occult, Japanese culture, or all of the above. They were extraordinarily plain, so the fact that Stella ended up as she did begged for an explanation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Soon after Anon and Fang were let inside, the familiar figure of their stego friend appeared. She's already donned her dungeon master attire, a purple robe complete with a pointy hat. She quickly thanked her dad, allowing him to go about his own business.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh hey, guys! Come, come, we were all waiting for you!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, sorry" Fang replied, looking at Anon expectantly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yea uh, we didn't look at the time cause we were fucking."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The awkward sentence hung in the air between them. Even Stella's dad turned back around at the end of the hallway, making Anon question his own sanity. Of all the times, why did his retardation have to betray him now? To add insult to injury, Stella didn't seem to understand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You were effing what?" she asked, confused.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The apparent silence, combined with their embarrassed looks was response enough, and Stella's face soon went up in crimson too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"O-oh, haha... Well um..." Stella, bless her heart, tried to somehow get on top of the situation "T-there are some, um, drinks in the fridge, and um, the others are already downstairs."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With that she stepped away from the duo, shooing her dad away awkwardly. As soon as Stella turned her back to them, Fang gave Anon such a death-stare that he was surprised he didn't go up in flames on the spot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The rest of the evening went more or less without incident. After some smalltalk and catching up with rumors, the participants once again turned their attention to the game at hand. Stella was absolutely ecstatic. They all pulled out their respective character sheets, and their enthusiastic game master handed out small plastic figures for each of them. After that Stella dimmed the lights and climbed on top of her chair, towering over the party ominously. Or rather as ominously as a bubbly girl like she could, with that stupid hat and all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Welcome, adventurers!" she began her speech in a deepened voice, trying to sound mysterious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To Anon's surprise, there were a couple "Yeah!"-s, and "Whoo!"-s, one coming from none other than Fang. At some point, she's also asked Stella for an eyepatch, and now looked completely enthralled with the game.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You have been summoned by the famous good witch Stellior, to embark on a great and perilous journey! And yet you must, for only the seven of you can save the realm from complete destruction! You must defeat the evil shapeshifting warlock, known only as Ko'upe before he could usher in eternal darkness! You have to make your way to his fortress on top of the icy mountains, surrounded by dark forests and deadly marshes! There, you will need to collect all seven pieces of his soul and destroy them! But fear not, heroes, for I, the good witch Stellior will use my magic to keep you safe! Behold, the book of Loley!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At that point, Stella produced a book from under her robes. Even at first glance, Anon could tell that it was pretty old. The pages had that distinct yellow color to them, and the binding itself looked all wrinkled and leathery. Truth be told, upon closer inspection, it looked very much like old, dried skin. But it couldn't be, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stella, what the hell is that?" he asked, somewhat concerned.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I don't know who this 'Stella' is, for I am the good witch Stellior! And I'll let you know that it is a great and ancient artifact, from the dungeon of um... Int Ernet!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She sounded clearly annoyed that Anon would break immersion right in the middle of her story. He wasn't convinced though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ugh fine! I got it from the same site I got my Ouija board from, okay? Can we continue now?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Woah, is that safe?" Rosa interjected.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Are you serious?" Fang asked "Are you afraid of a toy?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">An argument lasting for several minutes ensued, only ending when Stella loudly threw the book on the table. She looked at her friends, cheeks puffed out in her anger that her game got so rudely interrupted.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"AHEM! FEAR NOT, HEROES, AND BEHOLD THE BOOK OF LOLEY!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Everyone promptly shut up, and Stella could finally continue her speech. She opened up the book on a seemingly random page, and started reading - or pretending to be reading - some gibberish mumbo-jumbo. It made Anon sit up and inspect the book closer. All he could make out was written in some fantasy language, complete with weird, accented letters that he's never seen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*Szia Uram! Jól beszoptad öreg, remélem csíped a lolit mer' ha nem akkor nyeled a brokit.*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was exceedingly hard to read, and for some weird reason it seemed to get harder the more he tried. The letters started to mesh together, jumping around on the page. He blinked a few times, trying to focus, only to find that the book itself, the table, the room, and her friends in it were quickly blending together into a cacophony of colors. His heartbeat quickened. He tried to yell, to stand up, but all power left his body.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Only the darkness remained.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Chapter I]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The golden glow of sunshine shining over his closed eyelids felt incredibly comforting, same as the gentle caress of the grass and the light breeze of the wind. It was all perfect, he could lay there all afternoon. But then someone had to ruin it. Not far from him some obnoxious child just had to pick that exact time to start crying. Loudly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If that wasn't enough, a shadow towered over him, blocking the sun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on Anon, geth up!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">By the sounds alone, it was some little girl. Did he pass out in a daycare? What the hell? Although this voice sounded familiar, kinda like Fang's. Not that Anon really cared. Only so few things could compel him to get up, and a child surely wasn't one of them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Go away!" he tried to protest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There was something wrong, however. His own voice sounded different somehow. Just wrong. More chipper and with a higher pitch. Eerily like how he sounded as a little kid.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As if there was a spring in place of his spine he sat up, opening his eyes. After a brief flash of blinding sunlight, a meadow came into view. Several bodies were scattered around it, in various stages of getting up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All of them, children. All of them, he knew. And all of them wearing alarmingly medieval-fantasy-looking clothing. The crying apparently came from a minified version of Trish. Fortunately, an also smaller yet way fattier Rosa quickly waddled up to her, cradling Trish's head in a motherly way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Looking down at his own body with widened eyes, a pair of short, lanky legs greeted him. He was also wearing some kind of armor, just like the others. He brought one of his gloved hands in front of his face. Moving his arm felt weird, as if all the weights were in the wrong place. His reach was also much shorter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Geth up, dummy!" Fang demanded again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still in his panicked state, Anon looked at his girlfriend. In place of the slender and sexy visage, a slightly puffy and freckled face looked back at him. Fang's hair played the same silvery color, except it was cut much shorter and the front ended in bangs just above her eyes - one of which was covered by an eyepatch. The oft-irritated expression she usually held was also missing in favor of a toothy grin, which was just one incisor short of perfect. It also explained why she had problems with the "t" sounds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The usual punk-goth attire of Fang was all gone, though that made sense with everyone wearing robes or armor. This Fang wore some weird cross between a maid's outfit, and what a pirate would wear, topped with a tiara. Pirate princess, was it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Absurd as the situation was, Anon couldn't suppress his laughter. It came out more like a squirrel squeaking, but he enjoyed it nonetheless.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wow Fang, you are a real pirate now!" he laughed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She grimaced at the sarcastic remark, sticking her tongue out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Geth up or I'm going tho hith you on the head!" she threatened Anon in the same lispy albeit now annoyed tone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not heeding the warning, Anon started squeaking that much harder. Before Fang could do good on her promise and bring her fist down, Anon wised up. Throwing his hands in the air to signal surrender, he instead focused on getting up from the ground.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It wasn't an easy process. Just like his arms before, the rest of his body felt strange and wrong, uncooperative. The weight of the armor wasn't helping either. Although as the seconds passed, he could swear that the metal garb started feeling as part of his body rather than a cumbersome shell around it. The straps stopped biting into his skin, the sheathe of his sword settled in its trusty place rather than dangling about, his red cloak an old companion than a stranger hindering his movements. The heat, oppressive at first, felt cozy and protective. By the time he got up, he really felt like a knight in shining armor. Even with how short he was compared to his adult form, he was still a good head taller than pirate princess Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Looking around on the grassy field, he could see their friends gathered up around Trish, who by then had stopped crying. Motioning at Fang to follow, he made his way there too. It was really uncanny to see the party like that. Fang's cute tomboyish form wasn't such a big surprise, he saw photos of her afterall. Rosa - not counting the horizontal stretch - didn't really change that much. Her hair got a bit shorter maybe, plus she was covered in plate armor, a lot heavier than Anon's chainmail. Complete with a mace and shield.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish was another deal altogether. The trike was wearing the same gear as Anon, but she's also donned a pair of glasses so thick that her eyes were almost invisible behind them. Her hair was cut a lot shorter than before, more or less a monk's cut without the bald spot. Her horns were little more than nubs on her face, almost imperceptible among the forest of zits and pimples. If Anon had to put it in a single word, Trish looked like a nerd. And a pathetic one at that. Steve Urkel could probably beat her up. For a moment he wondered where that name came from. He didn't know anyone like that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser was pretty much her polar opposite. He looked just as athletic as ever, standing tall proudly. He was about equal height to Anon, and seemed to be covered in the same heavy armor as Rosa. Except he was wielding a huge two-handed hammer. It had to be heavy as all hell, but the ptero paladin was keeping it upright with a single hand. The biggest change however was his wings though, or at least Anon felt like they were. He couldn't really put his finger on it, but somehow the pair of wings seemed out of place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Next on the roster was Naomi, cowering behind her boyfriend's back. She was a cross somewhere between Trish and Fang, although Anon wasn't sure how else she could look. Afterall, it was always how she's been. Definitely thin, though Anon couldn't exactly call her sickly. Her hair was flowing freely down to her waist. Her face - and Anon hated himself for making this comparison - was that of an angel. No unchecked eczema, like the one decorating Trish, and no puffiness like Fang's. She was nothing short of perfect, other than her glasses. They were a bit on the heavy side, but more elegant than unattractive. The only thing not doing any favors for the young girl were her robes, which were so baggy that they looked a size too big for her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed was the last one to waltz into the picture. Clad in leather armor and strumming lightly on a wooden ukulele, which seemed to be his only means of self-defense. Anon somehow felt like he should be making a comparison here, yet he couldn't for the life of him figure out to what. Reed was Reed, their bard.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In any case, they weren't getting one bit closer to their objective by wasting time sitting around. Ko'upe was on the move! Looks like Fang was on the same track, cause she stepped forward, forcefully pulling Trish from the ground.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on now Thish, we have tho go!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ugh, but I don't wanna!" the small trike protested.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fang is right, Trish" Naser said in a scolding manner "We have to save the world!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But I wanna go home!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A collective sigh of frustration escaped everyone's lips as Trish crossed her arms on her tiny chest. It was once again Fang who tried breaking past the barrier.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ith's okay Thish. You can go home afther we saved the world, all righth?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For some unexplainable reason, the words "charisma check" danced to the front of Anon's brain. He didn't really understand, but it was a fleeting thought anyway. Luckily Trish deflated too, looking down at her feet bashfully.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"O-okay Fang."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That's more like ith, soldier!" Fang exclaimed cheerfully "Adventhure awaiths!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without any more hindrances, the seven of them formed a line behind Naser and returned to the road beside the meadow. Their break was over, the quest remained. It could very well have been their last pleasant stop, for soon they'd arrive at the cold and harsh land of Cisylvania, home of vampires, werewolves, and all sorts of nasties!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As the day turned to evening, so the small group arrived at their first checkpoint. A town, built right on the edge of the dark forest, by the foot of the mountains. Something told Anon that it used to be a popular trading hub once, back when the trees cast pleasant summer shade and not the unnerving wintery shadow they did then. He had no idea how he could know something like that though, maybe he read it somewhere? Be as it may, those days were long gone. What he was sure of is that business moved from the mountainous region as it filled with monsters.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The town was guarded by high stone walls, the cracks between the heavy cobblestones laden with moss. As the party approached, the guards on the catwalk trained their bows on them. None of them were older than fifteen, although Anon wasn't sure why he had to make that remark. It was just natural, so he felt rather foolish for it. Something just didn't feel right ever since he woke up on the meadow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Who goes there?" the stern voice of a girl sounded from above.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The party lined up in front of the gates, and Naser stepped forward.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We're adventurers! Please let us in!" he called out to the girl.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why would I do that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A fair question, yet one that Naser didn't seem to have an answer to. Their mission was a secret one, after all. Reed, the charmer of the group had it handled, however.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"He said please!" he yelled, playing a few notes on his instrument.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The guards looked at one another, nodding in mutual understanding. The girl who was most likely their captain held off for a few seconds, but ultimately didn't have a problem with them entering.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thus, the gates opened, leading our heroes to a small square filled with teens going about their business. Only so few of them spared the group any notice. On all sides of the square sturdy stone cottages rose over them, most two or even three stories high. They emitted a safe, cozy atmosphere until Anon looked at them better. Then he saw that the guards were protecting little more than rubble with all of the boarded-up windows, and dilapidated, caved-in rooftops.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alrighth guys, whath do we do now?" Fang asked, climbing up on a bench and placing her hands on her hips as if asking for a challenge.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Maybe we should find a place to sleep?" Trish suggested quietly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I vote yes!" Naomi added posthaste "I am tired of all the ick and muck! I want to sleep in a bed! Furthermore, I want to cuddle my little witwe Naser-waser-sweetiepie!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A loud "EWW" echoed through the square in response to the lovey-dovey comment. Anon acted like he was gonna get sick too, just to drive home the point. Naomi stuck her snout up, offended.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser-waser-sweetiepie took charge of the situation after that, his face only slightly red.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I think we should split up. Trish, Rosa, go get some supplies. We'll need gear to climb the mountains, and I also want gummy bears!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Me too!" Reed interjected, prompting everyone to add their wish to the list.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I want hot choccie!" Rosa exclaimed, last in line - then it dawned on her that she was the one going to the store anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...Okay, so" Naser continued "Naomi and me will go get us rooms somewhere. Don't make any trouble, okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Whath abouth us?" Fang asked her brother, upset that she got left out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang crossed her arms in front of her chest like Trish did not long ago, puffing out her reddened cheeks. Yet whereas Trish looked like a sore loser, Anon found Fang incredibly cute. Not that he was ever gonna tell her, cause that was sappy girly stuff.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Meanwhile Naser thought about what task to give the trio, but he came up empty. Of course that wasn't nearly good enough for Fang, so she grabbed Anon by the hand and started dragging him away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on Anon, we're gonna geth thice as much gummy bears than sthupid Naser!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And so, the two of them left the group behind. Fang was huffing and puffing for a while longer still, yet after wading through what was practically a labyrinth of back-alleys and narrow streets, she gave up on trying to find a candy store. Anon was secretly thankful for that, his arm started hurting from Fang's relentless tugging on it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The two of them entered a park-looking area, complete with a fountain in the middle. There were a few lanterns hanging from the wrought iron lampposts, almost all of them lit. Not many weeds either, and the bushes were all trimmed. Whoever lived around here, it seemed like they weren't gonna let their neighborhood become a ruin like those houses near the gates.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang climbed up onto the wide stone wall of the fountain, laying down with a tired moan. Anon sat up beside her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ahh, this is pointhess!" she exhaled "We're never gonna geth gummy bears here!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's okay, Fang. Rosa and Trish are gonna get them!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She gave Anon a look of disbelief, as if the human didn't yet figure out that it wasn't really about the candy. But oh, he knew. He knew very well how stubborn Fang could be, and how she must have hated that Naser handled her like a stupid little girl. Not that Anon could blame him, not a lot anyway. Nine times out of ten Fang was just a sillypants, and not someone you'd trust with your shopping.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Do you wanna share a room with me, Anon?" she asked suddenly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"A room ath the inn! I wanth us to geth a room thogether!" Fang explained as she sat up, eyeing Anon coyly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"B-but!" Anon felt week at the knees, his voice cracking "But what about Rosa a-and Trish?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I don'th wanna share a room with smelly Rosa or stupid Thish! I wanna share a room with you so thath's thath!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"B-but I didn't even say yes!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Despite his protest, he knew that it was already decided. If Fang wanted something then she'd get that something. More often than not when the something was Anon. Funny that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on Anon, ith's gonna be so cool! We can sthay up lathe and eath ice-cream!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But Fang we don't have ice-cream!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fine, then we can kiss!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"W-what?! Eww!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">His face went up bright red in an instant, sweat forming on his bald head. If there was one thing he didn't know how to handle, it was girls. Well, there were several things he couldn't handle, but girls were the worst of it. To make matters worse, it was Fang. The two of them have been thick as thieves these last few weeks, but kissing?!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Whath, do you like boys?" Fang asked in a mocking tone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"N-no...!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon likes bo~oys, Anon likes bo~oys!" she stared chanting.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No! I like girls!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh-huh, then prove ith!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fine!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without a second more hesitation, determined and fuelled by his sudden rage against Fang's mockery, he leaned in and placed a smooch on the ptero girl's cheek. He felt very confident. Victorious. Now he showed her! Alas, Fang didn't seem even a bit fazed. Not even blushing, how was that possible?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nuh-uh Anon, thath doesn't counth! Ith has tho be a proper kiss!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fine!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once again, he leaned forward. A lot slower this time, closing his eyes too. Or maybe he should open them? Okay, he opened one of them. But Fang was looking back! Oh no!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He closed his eyes again. Would he have to lean in closer? But Fang had a snout, so... W-was he gonna have to use tongue?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before he could think more on it, something pressed up against his lips. In that instant, the world seemed to slip away from around him. Quite literally. The coldness of the stone was gone, the heat contained within his armor as well. The chirping of the crickets and the noises of the streets. All but him in the darkness, in a body that felt much more familiar.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once again, he was a young adult. Looking around, the darkness stretched on endlessly. At least that's how it felt to Anon, though in the pitch black there very well could have been a wall right in front of him. He reached out, trying to grasp onto something. Anything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before panic could have set it, another figure appeared. It was Fang, but not the one he was kissing. This Fang was grown up, and in her normal torn goth clothing. She caught Anon's stretched-out hand, running her slender fingers through his.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As she did, color returned to the world. They were in a room, her room. Guitars on the walls, scent of menthol cigarettes in the air. But more importantly, the feeling of safety, happiness, and perhaps excitement? It must have been the first time Anon saw that room. Before midterms. Fang was about to offer her guitar to him, and he'd have to decide if they should study instead.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He didn't know what to think or feel anymore. One scene came after another, memories or dreams, detailing his life with Fang, Reed, Naser, and all the rest of them. In mids of the feverish visions, one voice singled out of the chaos. It sounded familiar too, but he couldn't place it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hurry Anon! The fate of this universe is in your hands! You are my only hope!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Rosa, what are we gonna do?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The little trike followed her cleric friend like sheep follow their shepherd. Their hunt for a candy store hasn't been going too well. Thankfully, the two of them were responsible enough to put sweets at the end of their shopping list. Their backpacks were nearly bursting with warm clothes, climbing gear, camping supplies, and food.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Kalma, Trish, kalma!" Rosa said, without even a hint of worry in her voice "You just should have faith in our Lord. Good children get candy, naughty ones do not."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wow Rosa, I didn't know you worshipped Santa Claus!" Trish responded with a cheeky grin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What I meant to say," the cleric explained patiently "was that if you have no faith in the Lord, there is no reason for Him to reward you. But if you do, you'll get your happiness eventually. Sencillo como eso."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As if to give emphasis to her words, Rosa turned one last corner and blindly hurried to the first building on the row. Trish was more than hesitant to follow, calling out to her friend from the bottom of the stone steps leading to the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I dunno Rosa, this doesn't look like a candy shop to me" she whined, looking at the flagon-shaped sign on the wall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, I'm sure they'll serve you a glass of milk."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There was some urgency in Rosa's voice and she was eyeballing the street they just came from, putting the triceratops at unease.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"B-but..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Either Rosa didn't see the tension building up behind Trish's thick glasses or she just didn't care. She took the trike by the hand, dragging her inside. Dozens of eyes turned their way as they practically tore the door off its hinges. The tavern was packed with people, some as young as five, but others on the older side of their teens. After the awkward entry, Rosa waddled up to the counter silently, with Trish almost gripping her tail in fear as she followed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Rosa I don't like this!" the trike whispered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once again, the orange dino paid her friend no heed. Not until they've been served a couple of glasses of warm sugary milk, and been seated at a more or less clean table. After a few minutes have passed and the other patrons lost their interest in the duo, Rosa took one last look at the door, then turned to Trish. The warrior has never seen her friend this serious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't freak out, but I think someone was following us." Rosa whispered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"W-WHAT?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Shhhhhh!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A few guests shot annoyed glances their way, but fortunately nobody seemed really care.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's okay Trish, I think we've lost them."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish didn't respond, instead took a few loud gulps of her drink. Her hands were shaking so badly that she almost spilled the beverage multiple times. As the initial shock subsided, she tried to rationalize it to herself. They were on a quest of great importance. It would make sense that powerful people would be interested. At least it was only a spy, and not an assassin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">How long until it would be one, though?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed was wandering the streets aimlessly, strumming on his ukulele without a care in the world. After Fang and Anon left, the party split up and everyone went to see their business done. All except for him, left to his own devices. He thought about going after Naser and Naomi, but he didn't want to bother the couple. Instead he picked a street at random, determined to find something worth his while.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As chance would have it, the road took him to a colorful market. Stalls lined the road from both sides, banners and lanterns hanging in the air between the houses, performers dancing and juggling on the corners. It was all he needed to get his mind off of their quest for a little while. Who needed that darkness stuff all day? It was time to have some fun!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As such, he's bought himself some candied apples, downing them one after the other. After about the fourth one, he stumbled upon a small crowd. They were all gathered up in front of a stage, upon which a band of actors was playing a scene. From what Reed could make out, it was some generic story about a princess needing rescue. It wasn't half bad, so he decided to watch till he finished his apples.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the end though, he stayed for long after. As it turned out, the character he mistook for a princess earlier was the main heroine, and she was out on a quest to save her father, the king. Reed was quickly enamored with her headstrong antics and lovely freckled face. Of course, as he soon realized it was because of the uncanny resemblance to another freckled face he knew. Except this one had purple hair, feathers, and markings.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As the image of his ptero friend crossed Reed's mind, ache made its way to his heart. He's had a crush on Fang ever since they knew eachother, but the girl saw him no more than a friend. He shook his head, trying to banish these thoughts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed returned his attention to the play, but he could only continue to watch for so long. In his eyes, the actress turned into Fang already, and there was no way he'd watch her get stolen away by this or that stupid knight or whatever. With a frown he tore away from the spectacle, this time deciding upon a dark, narrow-looking alley tucked in between a couple of run-down houses.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The laughs and woos of the crowd followed him for a few minutes, making him that much more mad. It was all stupid Anon's fault! Reed knew that any day now, he was gonna tell Fang about his feelings and she would be his girlfriend, but then that dumb human had to come along! What did Anon have that he didn't? Nothing! He was just a dumb skinnie! Why didn't Fang see that?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As these heavy thoughts permeated his mind, the young raptor made his way through the dark alleys. Eventually though, he made it to a more or less nice neighborhood, with lanterns once again shining down on the worn cobble road. He stopped and listened. Miraculously, he could still hear the actress, her voice so similar to Fang's.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But wait, no... That wasn't right. These sounds were coming from straight ahead. His anger, if not vanished, but subsided as curiosity took over. Slowly he inched his way to the nearest corner, where a high iron fence stopped him. Bushes blocked his way too, same as his vision. He was sure, however, that Fang's voice was coming from the other side. He could hear her clearly now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on Anon, ith's gonna be so cool! We can sthay up lathe and eath ice-cream!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of course she'd be with Anon. What were they planning?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But Fang we don't have ice-cream!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fine, then we can kiss!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What? The raptor's eyes widened. No way!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He missed Anon's reply, but he was sure the boy somehow tricked Fang into this! There was no way Fang would want to kiss a human! Eww!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed continued to listen as Fang teased Anon, goading him into a kiss. He refused to believe what was happening. A bit later as Fang yelled that she wanted a proper kiss was the last straw. Reed turned his back on his friends, returning to the dark alleys with a heavy chest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At least in there, nobody would see him crying...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Abruptly as the vision came, so it passed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We're gonna be boyfriend and girlfriend!" Anon blurted out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Deal!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No, I mean I saw it! Like, in the future!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Haha! I knew thath I was an amazing kisser!" Fang teased, pouting.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At first, Anon frowned that Fang wasn't taking him seriously, but his annoyance quickly turned to panic. A few of his memories about the real world still lingered, but he could feel them slipping away again. He closed his eyes, trying to grasp even a single one of them. If he could, maybe he could make sense of the situation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Somehow, he ended up in this weird video-game-like limbo, straight out of an isekai anime. He had no idea how or why, and why Fang was with him. Was this even the real Fang? Could she remember the real world if he told her about the memories? After all, how could she forget about the time they... When they...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To his shock, the memory was gone already. Was it a happy one? Was it a sad one? Not even a morsel of it remained.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey um, are you okay?" Fang asked with a concerned voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon opened his eyes again, looking at her. He knew there was something he wanted to ask the little pirate, but what it exactly was eluded him. Only that feeling of something being amiss endured.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Do you ever feel like you're not who you're supposed to be?" he asked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The question prompted Fang to scoot closer to him, dangling her legs over the edge of the fountain. She looked down at her feet, thinking about her answer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, I guess..." she said in a calm and soft voice, uncharacteristic from her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon felt tremendous relief that he wasn't going crazy after all, that there was something seriously wrong with the world. Only till Fang continued, however. Seemed like the young girl misread the question.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Somethimes I think I should be a paladin like Naser, then I could beath up all the meanies!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Um... That's not what I mean, Fang."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He had absolutely no idea how to translate his feelings into words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's like... Okay, you know when you sit for a long time and your legs go like zzzzzzz?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh-huh"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And then you can't move it right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh-huh"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Imagine if you're the leg!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon thath makes no sense!" she laughed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He furrowed his brows, trying to explain it better.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's like when you know you should be a leg and move, but you're still zzzzzzzz and you can't and you're just a thing and not a leg, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He felt like that explanation should have more than sufficed, yet Fang just kept on laughing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...forget it..." he mumbled.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Apparently Fang did just as much, getting up from the fountain and grabbing her brand new boyfriend by the hand yet again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on Anon, let's find the others before Naser puths me in a room with someone else!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Amazingly, Fang found their way straight back to the square where they've split up earlier. Reed was already - or maybe still - there, sitting on a bench and playing a melancholic tone. As if driven by some higher force, Rosa and Trish made their appearance in a matter of seconds too, swiftly followed by Naser and Naomi. After Fang very loudly announced that Anon was her boyfriend now, the seven of them made their way to the inn.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Obviously Naser has long booked their rooms, but Fang being Fang was adamant about sharing a room with Anon. In the end, Naser and Naomi had to give up their own room. This would have, of course, put Reed with the two other girls, who wouldn't have that. As such, it quickly ended up with Naser and Reed becoming impromptu roommates, same as the gaggle of the three girls. Everyone was clearly mad at Fang, but she didn't seem to care one bit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once the room situation was settled, the girls and Reed made their leave. Anon, Fang, and Naser on the other hand ordered some munchies, sitting down in a corner. Anon was amazed that Naomi would skip this opportunity to indulge herself, but then he realized that she must have already milked Naser for a fancy dinner. He also had his suspicions that Naser stayed with them both to make sure Fang didn't cause them to get thrown out, and mainly to give Anon the good ol' dead eyes for daring to seduce his sister.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was weird to see the paladin like that, to Anon it always felt like the ptero boy didn't have a single bad bone in his body. Then again, Fang was his family. He couldn't muse himself on that for long though, as a stranger approached them. Clad in leather armor and a green cloak, skin dark like the night, pointed ears, and long silver hair. His face was sharp yet gentle, maybe a little feminine. Couldn't have been older than Anon, but it was hard to tell.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Are you going to the mountains?" the dark elf asked cautiously, skipping right past the formalities.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We might." Naser spoke up "I'm Naser. What is your name, friend?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sorry. My name is Dizzit Dudden."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A pause settled over the conversation, the trio waiting for Dizzit to speak up, and him to awkwardly hop from one leg to the other, seemingly unsure how to continue.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Whath do you wanth?" Fang snapped at the stranger impatiently.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He took a bit to respond, carefully considering what to say.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You all look like adventurers, so if you're going to the mountains I would like to ask for a favor. I've lost my swords you see."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why not buy new ones? I'm sure there's a smith in this town." Naser pointed out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"These swords are very special, both to me and on their own. They could cut through any armor."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon's eyes widened at the claim, his heartbeat rising. He's heard of special swords like that, folded over a thousand times till they got strong enough to cut clean through iron and steel. All of the coolest heroes wielded swords like that! If he got one, he'd be just as cool and Fang couldn't call him a dweeb anymore!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay!" he blurted out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The Arin siblings shot him a surprised glance, but he didn't care. He was gonna be the coolest swordsman ever!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Drizzt on the other hand couldn't have been happier, unaware of Anon's shady motives. His awkwardness washed away in an instant, giving way for unbound enthusiasm as he started describing some sort of bandit camp, where his weapons would apparently be.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They chatted up for a while after that until their food was all gone, then bid farewell to the weird dark elf. Afterwards they all retreated to their rooms. Before Anon could have followed Fang inside, Naser pulled him to the side.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon," he started out in a very serious, scolding tone "I don't mind helping out those in need, but this is not our mission. We cannot have any delays, like running back and forth to town."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Chill out Naser! It's not gonna take that long, and I don't even want to give the stupid swords back."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Upon hearing that the paladin shoved Anon hard against the wall, seething with anger.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You'd make me a liar?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ugh fine, I'll give 'em back after, okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All he got was a stern look.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Like, Trish and I could use better swords, okay? It's for the good of the mission!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser didn't look one bit convinced, but he let go of Anon nonetheless. He gave the human one last shove for good measure, leaving him with a warning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Careful, Anon. We don't need two warriors in the party."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Whath was thath abouth?" Fang asked as soon as Anon entered the room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Um, nothing."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Try as he might, Naser's word shook him. He never considered that he'd get in trouble with his friends.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh-huh, then Naser didn'th justh warn you tho sthay away from me?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh? No."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, don'th you lie tho me!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The small ptero put her hands on her hips, acting like a mother telling off a bad child. She's already climbed on top of a bed too, as she usually did. Anon would have found it cute, were it not for the current situation. He felt like everyone suddenly turned on him, and it totally wasn't fair!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Am not!" Anon protested.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Pinky promise?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang's serious gaze burned holes through him. What was it with them and lies? As if they never lied to anyone ever!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As soon as the word left his mouth, Fang hopped down from the bed acting as if the whole interrogation didn't just happen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Whathcha wanna do? Wanna play a game?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The sudden change confused the Anon, but he was glad to let it go too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The two of them ended up playing pretend pirates using Fang's - unloaded - pistols, and by Anon donning a makeshift eyepatch. Despite Fang's offer from earlier, there was no ice-cream nor make-out session. Anon was a little disappointed by the latter, but he was also glad to evade a possibly humiliating situation. He's never kissed anyone before, so he was sure to be horrible at it. They did go to sleep holding hands over the bed frame though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Alas, no matter how tired he was, sleep eluded him for quite a long time. As before, he had this weird sensation of not belonging, that he was somewhere he shouldn't be. On top of that, now he had this odd notion as if he was being watched.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Aww my brave hero, you're so close to the truth!" the apparition thought, its immaterial body perched at the end of Anon's bed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If only the human would reach out and see, this nightmare could be over already. It was wishful thinking though. People don't want to question their reality. They don't want to think that it's all a game, a veil put over their eyes. At least normal people didn't. The same could not be said about the one keeping the watcher captive. It was just around time the jailor would make his evening visit too, so it was high time to dispel the specter and return to the misery of the small cell.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And so it was. In the highest reaches of the highest tower, on top of the highest mountain, the dark lord Ko'upe ascended the stairs to see his prisoner, his free ticket to the real world. He knew very well that this reality he's been bound to was little more than a fabrication. A tale to tell. If it wasn't for his immense willpower, surely he'd already given in to despair and crumble. To think that the entire world and all those in it came to existence a little less a day ago made his head spin. He himself refused to believe it at first, even if it was so obvious. With just a little bit of effort anyone could figure it out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Children cannot run a kingdom. Houses don't get built by children, animals aren't tamed by children, food isn't produced by children. Not in amounts nor in time complex societies need to function. And yet there it was. Everything put in place, only to fall into an inevitable downward spiral of chaos in just a few months. When would the people of the land realize? When would they question why the caravans never reach their destination on time? Why the harvest won't be finished before the crops freeze? Would they simply accept that without learned people, sickness will burn through the population unchecked and unchallenged? How cruel it was, really. Made one question how something like that came to pass. Why did it all exist?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without his captive, he never would have known. If it wasn't for them, he'd be hell bent on ruling over this world, a dream he was sure he's had since he was a child too. But really, was he ever a child? His memories, same as the bricks that made up his fortress, were created by someone else, implanted in his head to compel him to play his part. For this was nothing more than theater for one select individual, the accursed witch Stellior. She held all the strings. But not for long. He's finally got what he needed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The thought made him chuckle to himself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Finally" he said it out loud, amused.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even with knowing that the whole wide world was younger than a single day, his very speech reinforced that deception.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Soon, he stood in front of the heavy wooden door leading to the tower cell. He raised his scaly hand open it, however something compelled him to stare at his palm instead. He could see the veins pulsating with blood under the pale, nigh transparent skin. Even for his own race, he was considered sickly all his life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All his life? Another false memory. He didn't live that life. Nobody did. How ironic that this elusive world, the world that could have been formed in any shape the witch so desired, would be threatened by a shapeshifter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He found himself smiling again. There were those that believed, with all of their hearts, that the evil warlock Ko'upe has set out to shroud the entire world in darkness. If only they knew that he was no longer driven by such a lowly goal! No! He will bring justice to this world. He'll tear this cruel joke, this mockery of free will apart, and win his own freedom. The witch would pay - wherever she was hiding - in due time. First, he needed to figure out his new toy, bend it to his will.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With renewed determination, he opened the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yes, he will be free. Whatever it took.</div>
