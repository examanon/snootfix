                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Wheel Of Fortune</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang, Trish, Reed, Naomi, Olivia</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Pshy</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I tapped my foot impatiently, just my luck to get called to the principals office first thing in the morning. I didn't even know what this was about! I hadn't torrented that much using the schools bandwidth and it's not like I was bullying anyone after Trish's little stunt. The thought still made my blood boil, some days I wonder if I did the right thing by forgiving her. I sighed as I let my anger cool, I only did it for Fang anyways, keep doing it for her. Maybe I was getting called in about being bullied? The students at Volcano High weren't very physical with their bullying but I was starting to seriously get sick of cleaning my locker of dicks and hentai. Why did the normies that bully people over anime even know that Boku No Pico exists? I didn't get time to wonder as Principal Spears finally opened the door to his office and ushered me in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stepping into the office I saw a girl I'd never seen before already here. She was the same shade of lime green as Stella though her hair was darker and matted. Not that her physical appearance was as striking as the wheel chair she sat in or the cast that her arm was wrapped in. Surprisingly she didn't react at all to my entrance, staring straight ahead at the Principals empty seat. Principal Spears sat down and gestured to the last remaining seat, next to the strange girl. I didn't exactly want to be suplexed into a car so I took it despite my confusion.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sure you're wondering why I called you here." Principal spears intoned ominously.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh, yeah actually. I really hope this doesn't involve more gardening" I admitted tentatively, Rosa's great and all but the woman's a slave driver.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Spears thankfully shook his head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"As you can see, Olivia here has suffered an injury on campus and due to her situation this impedes her ability to get to class." His tone was even but there was a dangerous undercurrent to it, Spears was absolutely livid and I silently thank Raptor Jesus that it's not directed at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So you want me to give her a hand?" I ventured, sensing the direction this was going.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Precisely." He replied with a nod of his head. "I don't have any staff to spare and you're someone that I trust. I believe you two might have more in common than you think." Spears let a small smile grace his features.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The girl, Olivia, finally looked at me but rather than say anything she just stared at me suspiciously. Spears was handing me a paper with her schedule on it when I finally realized just what he said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wait, you trust me?" I couldn't keep the shock from my voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You've changed a lot since we've first met." Was that pride in his voice? "Not the least of which is your taste if the logs are to be believed." Even despite the glasses I could feel the judgmental look he gave me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I coughed nervously, "You know what, class is about to start! Ready to go Olivia?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The girl in question grunted and I took hold of her chair, making an escape before Spears could threaten me with anything else. Wheeling her down the halls I finally took a look through her schedule when I noticed something that would help break the ice</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh hey, you share a homeroom with Naser" I tried to act nonchalant.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Olivia took the bait, "You know Naser?" Her voice was a little gruff, like she hadn't used it in a while.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh yeah, he's my girlfriends brother. Was my first friend at school too." I let a little enthusiasm creep into my voice, Naser was an absolute bro. If things with Fang kept going this well then maybe he actually would be my bro.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mine too" was all she said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We walked in silence for a few minutes, Spears said that we had something in common. Based on how little she was talking I was willing to bet she also wanted to ghost through school, just like I did. The end of the year was looming so she was pretty close to accomplishing her goals. I didn't want to imagine a timeline where I actually succeeded in my attempt. Someone should give her a little nudge, guess that someone was me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So, did he share his sandwich with you too?" I joked</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No." She replied, curt as ever</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But you said you guys are friends right? What do you two talk about?" I was genuinely curious, Naser was big into sports wasn't he? I don't think he and Olivia had a shared interest there.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She was quiet for a while, I thought about prodding her but I had long ago learned it was best to stay silent in these moments.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We don't talk much. Just the one thing we have in common." She admitted a little hesitantly</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, what's that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Being fucked up." She practically spat the words out "he's the only one in the school that understands." her tone growing bitter, I couldn't blame her but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But we had arrived at her homeroom, I parked her in class and gave her a wave goodbye that she didn't return. Once I left her classroom I let out a sigh and ran my hand over my head. How to go about this? Maybe I should talk to Naser? Unfortunately I didn't have time to do that since escorting Olivia hadn't relieved me of needing to go to my own class. Jogging through the halls to get there I couldn't help but cringe as some people shouted at me to 'do the naruto run', god fucking damnit Trish. Thankfully the people in my homeroom didn't mock me for the weebery exposed in the slideshow. Possibly because the homeroom teacher was a bigger weeb than I was, why the hell did he talk like that when he clearly wasn't japanese?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why hello there Anon!" A horrifyingly chipper voice sounded right behind me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hello to you too, Naomi" I responded warily, we never really talked before and I especially wasn't eager to start after learning about her plan with Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So I couldn't help but notice you pushing Olivia around! How very noble of you!" The nectarine nightmare said, her plastic smile looked uncomfortable.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, Principal Spears asked me to do it." Maybe telling her it was official business would get her off my back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That's wonderful to hear! I asked him to do it after all! Maybe you could introduce her to all your other friends?" The orchid oppressor was behind all this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My suspicion had doubled, the last time Naomi had tried this she had sort of master plan.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What are you getting at Naomi?" I asked directly, eyes narrowed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why, nothing! Naser kept asking me to arrange for some handicap accessible ramps that just aren't in the budget for a single student, maybe if she had friends to help her then she wouldn't need them." How did she manage to be so evil while sounding so happy?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Besides That poor girl just isn't very popular you know, Some bullies pushed her down the stairs even! Maybe if she had some friends that wouldn't happen again?" Her omnipresent smile never faltered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Did you just admit what I think you did?" I was utterly flabbergasted, this was a new low even for her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I didn't admit anything silly! Good luck with Olivia!" The coral cunt just walked back to her carefully crafted group of friends without waiting for a reply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Homeroom came and went with me barely noticing, shell shocked as I was. Holy fucking shit Naomi. I grabbed my things and headed out the door in a daze. While heading to Olivia's homeroom I caught the attention of a certain monochromatic weirdo who was quite surprised to see me. I gave her a a half hearted wave when she started jogging over to meet me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What are you doing in this part of the school? Miss me that much, huh?" Her grin was cocky as ever</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh... No, sorry Fang. Spears has me helping another student" I mumbled, my mind still back in homeroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She picked up on my mood quickly, concern clear in her voice "Hey, is everything alright? Was it the anime thing again?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shook my head, should I tell her? Even Fang might find this hard to believe. "No, it's just... I realized I REALLY hate Naomi."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She actually bust out laughing. "Ha! Welcome to the club." Even with the worry in my stomach I couldn't help but chuckle too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well as club president I guess I have to help you out." She tried to sound serious but failed to stop giggling. "Where's this mysterious student?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I fished out Olivia's schedule and showed it to Fang. "She seems a little lonely, wanna help me cheer her up?" I asked hopefully</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She pretended to think about it. "Hm... I dunno, What's in it for me?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I leaned over and planted my lips on her snout, smiling when I saw her cheeks redden</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How about more of those?" I offered, already knowing the answer</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"A-Alright dweeb, you made your point." She stammered, her wings ruffled in embarrassment</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With Fang at my side I felt a little better, I would have been thankful for Naomi setting us up if not for the fact that she was a god damned sociopath.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I got to Olivia's homeroom late enough that everyone had left by the time I got there. She barely glanced my way but her eyes locked onto Fang. Did they know each other?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So you're the one who's been trying to steal my boyfriend" Fang stuck her tongue out playfully</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My heart warmed hearing those words but Olivia stared at her completely deadpan, Swing and a miss then.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang looked a little unsure on how to react to somebody that completely ignored her so I stepped in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Olivia, this is Fang. Naser's sister." I offered helpfully, she seemed to respect him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I know." was her emotionless reply, she was still staring at Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So you know my brother then?" Fang asked diplomatically</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Olivia ignored her "Stop treating Naser like shit, Fang."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Both Fang and I were stunned at the blatant demand. I wanted to intervene but Fang was a big girl, I trusted her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang looked at Olivia with new eyes, the two of them stared at each other for a bit before Fang finally broke silence between them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, I know. We... Talked recently. Thanks to Anon." She glanced my way, that smile of hers was worth the world. Olivia actually looked at me as well, was that appreciation? I don't think I've seen her express emotion until now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I glanced at the clock, no more time for heart to hearts. Hurrying over to grab Olivia's chair I Wheeled her out of there in record time. Fang needed to get to her own class and waved us goodbye or at least waved Olivia goodbye, she returned the kiss I gave her earlier. When I tried to inform her that interest had accrued in the time it took her to pay me back she threatened to declare bankruptcy, Fearing an economic crash I absolved her of her debt. She was a wily investor but I'll get her next time. Maybe it was my imagination but I could have sworn I saw Olivia smile at our antics. It was hard to tell when her snout hid her jaw so well, come to think of it she didn't look quite like anyone else at school. I tried not to dwell on it as I wheeled her through the halls, she may have been a bit of a character but at least she looked original.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After delivering Olivia I was left with dawdling through my next class. I hadn't managed to make many friends and thanks to Trish I was on my own outside of science, music and math. At least today I had Olivia to think about, I really hated doing what Naomi wanted me to do but like any good manipulator she wanted me to do what I was going to do anyways. For once I really wished my social circle was wider, maybe if she's into music I could introduce her to Reed or Trish? Fortunately class didn't take too long and there was science to look forward too next, had to get Olivia first though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">When I stepped into her classroom she actually gave me a little wave, wow, this girl had some big talons. As I walked over to her and grabbed the chair handles I had to wonder who was brave enough to push her down stairs when she had claws like those. Naomi practically admitted it but she was never hands on with these things, she must have recruited someone else. As I wheeled her out of the classroom though the weirdness of it was starting to itch my brain. We seemed to have achieved some kind of rapport, she wouldn't mind if I just asked, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So Olivia, I hope you dont mind the question but what exactly are you?" I asked hesitantly, could have worded that better.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Olivia looked back at me, her expression unreadable. Oh god, I messed up. I should apologize.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry Oli-" I sputtered but Olivia cut me off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't worry about it, I know I'm different from any girl you've ever met." She muttered and looked forward again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh?" I sensed a follow up</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah." She nodded "Cuz I'm the worst one!" Her tone took a 180 and she started cackling.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I couldn't stop the snort of amusement from escaping me but rather than get upset Olivia only laughed harder when she realized her joke landed. Definitely didn't expect something like that from her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright, you got me. I didn't expect that" I smiled, shaking my head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well if she was cracking jokes then that was a good sign. There was something familiar about that brand of humor but I couldn't place my finger on it. Looking for more conversation starters I glanced her over, Plain backpack and simple clothes. No pins in her hair and no blemishes aside from a band-aid and some bruises from her fall. Wait a minute.. Was she wearing slippers? Were those designs what I thought they were? Did she actually know what those meant or did she just pick them up in some strange thrift store? Hm, What's a good way to go about this without revealing my power level?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I coughed to get her attention, "You watch the news, Olivia?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nah." She didn't sound very interested.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, it's just. I saw this thing about the hacker known as 4chan." Yeah, that sounded good.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Olivia thought about it for a moment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What did you say your name was again?" she asked</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well that was embarrassing, I don't think I ever gave it to her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You've got the one and only Anon Y. Mous as your chauffeur!" I tried my best to play it cool</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fuck off is that your name." She immediately replied, disbelief clear in her voice</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What's wrong with my name?" I tried not to sound upset, it was a good name!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She just snickered, what the hell was wrong with it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stop being cringe and hurry up already, Anon"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Checking my phone I realized she was right, we did need to hurry. I was going to be late for sure but I had a pretty good excuse, I bet Farnsworth wouldn't even notice. I said my goodbyes with Olivia and rushed over to class, eager to meet up with Fang again. Fortunately it was another day of partners which let me talk with sweet tooth as much as I wanted. Unsurprisingly we both ended up talking about Olivia, Fang seemed amenable to the idea of letting her hang with us at lunch. That just left Reed and Trish in math, until then it was time to figure out why the hell chelicerae were important to our education.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Olivia and I didn't actually talk much after I retrieved her. I'd made some good progress with her already, I didn't want to force anything. Olivia was an introverted soul through and through, she seemed quite content listening only to the squeak of her wheels and the ambient chatter of the students us. Turns out she shared her next class with Naser too, he smiled and waved when he saw me wheel Olivia in. Unfortunately Mr. Carldewskii was either incredibly lax or incredibly strict and I wasn't willing to risk his ire so I couldn't stop to catch up with him. Unfortunately when I got to math I realized that was all pointless, Mr. Carldewskii was fast asleep at his desk. The man had his porn mag shielding his eyes as he snored, 'XXXTRA FAT TAILS AND SNOUTS' was lettered bold and pink on the cover. How on earth did this guy stay employed?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thankfully that meant I got to talk to Trish and Reed about Olivia, Reed was as enthusiastic as you might expect. I'm really not sure why Reed hung out with us, the guy oozed charisma so how did he end up in the unpopular circle? It was fortunate that was the case though, I was counting on that charisma to work on Olivia. Trish put up the most resistance to the idea, of course she did, but seeing as she was outvoted 3 to 1 she had to put up with it. Democracy fucking sucks when it's actually democratic, ain't that right Trish?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The bell rung when I was in the middle of convincing Reed that bunny hopping in rock ring was grounds for murder. We normally walked to the cafeteria together but I had a certain, uh, whatever she was to go fetch. When I stepped into Olivia's room she was staring out a window, a small smile on her face. She was rapidly clacking her talons to the beat of music heard only in her head, I almost didn't want to interrupt. That toothy smile of hers didn't fade when she saw me, It was hard not to smile too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You up for having lunch with me and my friends, Olivia?" I asked hopefully, grabbing her chair and heading to the cafeteria.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You realize I literally can't move without you, right?" was her non-committal response.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, I didn't know if you had a place to liked to sit or maybe with Naser or..." I started to ramble</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Olivia's face darkened. "I like Naser but not enough to put up with Naomi" she said, vitriol oozing from her voice when she mentioned Naomi</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I couldn't help but chuckle despite her anger, "I think you'll get along with us just fine."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Actually getting our lunch took a little longer than usual but once we acquired our prison food masquerading as something edible I headed us off towards the auditorium.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You realize we're leaving the cafeteria, right?" She mentioned once we were past the doors</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, but we're cool guys who have a special hang out spot" I reassured her</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You mean you're segregated losers?" She countered lazily</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yep!" I replied cheerily "but us losers have a projector and movies"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She seemed enthused at that, fortunately it wasn't a long walk to the auditorium. Pushing open the doors had all three of my friends turn their heads. Wheeling her over we got our introductions out of the way, they went quickly but Olivia seemed a little out of her element. Maybe this was too many people at once? Thankfully I know just the thing to get the ball rolling.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What song were you banging out before lunch, Olivia?" I asked between mouthfuls of cardboard pizza.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sure enough, all three members of the Fang Gang had their interest piqued, lets hope the new girl had some good taste.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, uh, you know it was.. Dragonforce" her voice waned until she practically squeaked out the name.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Woah! That's a sick song, You gotta have some rythm!" Reed piped up enthusiastically</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I... Guess?" Olivia clearly didn't receive compliments often</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah man! I'm a drummer for VVURM DRAMA, I know these things." He slid an arm around her shoulders like they had been friends for years</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Plus" He continued, pointing to her biceps "those guns you got? You'd be a sick drummer."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Olivia's eyes widened and her cheeks reddened, I don't think she was used to people being physical with her let alone boys.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"S-so you said something about VVURM drama?" Olivia stammered out, eager to change the subject</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well that did it, Suddenly everyone was invested now. Fang pulled out some sheet music, asking her about the lyrics and sound boarding variations with her. Reed was going tapping out some of their songs for Olivia, still invested in getting her into drums it seems. Even Trish was involved, showing the overwhelmed girl all the merchandise she apparently carried on her just in case. Unfortunately I didn't have much to add here but I was just pleased to have everything work out. Olivia eventually accepted that she wasn't going to keep up but it was still going well, until she broke off her pizza and held it out to her backpack. The room was suddenly consumed with two distinctly different but very girly screams.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT!?" Trish shrieked and stumbled backwards</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"IT'S SO CUTE!" Fang squealed, her hands moving to her cheeks</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The cause of it all was a small rat perched on the lip of Olivia's backpack, Nibbling on the small slice of cardboard pizza handed to it. Why the hell did she have that? Did Spears know?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ohmygosh, what's his name?" Fang cooed, I've never seen her like this before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh, Guts?" Olivia answered uncertainly</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed tore off a large chunk of pizza and handed it to guts, the rat dropped the bite sized portion and immediately grabbed the oversized piece.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That thing was too big to be called pizza, too thick, too heavy, too rough" Reed started chuckling halfway through his gravelly speech</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I raised an eyebrow at him "Reed, have you been hanging out with Stella again?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He shrugged in response "What can I say, she finally started recommending good stuff"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Olivia looked curious "Stella? Another friend of yours?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shook my head and smiled, Watching fang pet Guts with a single finger was too cute. Olivia only just met everyone and she seemed to have hit it off with them. She was a reclusive girl and yet despite making a bunch of new friends and it looked like she was going to get another if she liked berserk enough to name her rat after it. One little push can change your life, I know that better than anyone. It only takes one friend to lead you to another, after all, you're not the only person in the world.</div>
