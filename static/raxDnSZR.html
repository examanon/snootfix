As did the 'original' Fang."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>you start to unload a barrage of questions but she just shushes you</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Let me finish. You died long ago, don't worry, you both lived a long and happy life. You also had many daughters."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Your daughters all married human men and had daughters of their own. Quite the coincidence huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she gives you a light jab with her elbow</div><div class="fanfic-line">>you could swear you flinched as if by instinct</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"And so it went, for many years. Eventually, all that was left were ptero and human couples."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh there were protests, but it's not like any of the men were forced. Human women just couldn't compete."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"We would have faded into the void, with a smile on our faces. But, we had children and they had no one to be with."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So, our darling progeny devised a plan. They would move heaven and earth to have what their ancestors did."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I'm sure you can figure out the rest out by yourself."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So here we are, you are hardly the first and not nearly the last."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang gets up and offers you her hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"What do you say Anon? Up for one more lifetime together?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You always have the choice to say no anon. You never asked for this and I wouldn't dream of forcing it on you. I won't lie it would crush me if you said no. You'd also be the first to do so."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There has never been an Anon that has opted out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But there has been plenty who took the news that they're a clone badly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They all cave in and come to terms with it when Fang says that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"We...I only wanted back the man I love. Neither time nor death would keep me from you Anon. I would break the grim reaper in half if I had to. Still, the Anon I knew and cherished was no puppet. He had his own free will as do you. I will accept any decision you make."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>You can leave now, and I won't stop you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But what would you hope to find out there?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>What you see in front of you now is what you'll see everywhere you go.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Every Fang with their Anon and every Anon with their Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If another Anon were made for me, you would be condemned to a veritable Hell, forever alone without your Fang. I can't do that. I won't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Our ancestors created a paradise here on Earth that the Gods could only dream of. Purpose, fulfillment, and unconditional love for everyone. For us, for our daughters, for their future husbands.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>To leave now would break my heart, but that would pale in comparison to the hearts of those who came before us. You would be disrupting the perfect balance they set out to create.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Defiling the paradise they bestowed upon us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Please, stay with me Anon. Don't let us be the ones to weaken the foundations of our utopia.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>as Anon watches the trembling Fang he ponders his next decision</div><div class="fanfic-line">>he could say no, there was no mental block preventing him from doing so</div><div class="fanfic-line">>yet, as he watched the ptero girl sob in front of him he could feel his heart ache</div><div class="fanfic-line">>despite the revelation, despite his free will, he couldn't say no</div><div class="fanfic-line">>he slowly reached towards Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>as he does the fallen angel looks upon him, her heavy tears running down her cheeks like rivers</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fang, we both know I could never say no to being with you for the rest of my life."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>To create heaven on Earth, Raptor Jesus sacrificed himself so that one day a prophecy would be filled</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That the descendant of Adam and his angel would fill the mortal plane, and set it free</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Gods children become a space-faring species, and spread his word and blessing to those yet to see his message</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Those who reject his message, are simply not yet ready, and are left alone by the galactic commonwealth until the time is right, or until they simply self-destruct of their own doing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even now, arks filled of his children reach out to distant galaxies to uplift those who would accept his teachings</div>
