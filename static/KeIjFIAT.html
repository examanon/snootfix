                    <div class="fanfic-line">Chapter 2</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Remind me again why I'm here?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Haha, to come to the beach with me of course!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah so, WHY am I here?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh come on, how can that be a bad thing? This heat is unbearable!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Can't really argue with that, I'm sweating my ass off here. I'm pretty sure that soon I'll be fused with the bus seat. But the jacket isn't coming off one second before it needs to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Really, if it wasn't for my lanklet body I wouldn't be complaining one bit. Spending a day with Stella can hardly be a bad thing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A sigh escapes my lips as the thought crosses my mind. It's all so weird still, Stella being by newest dino gee eff.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's been about two weeks since we became a thing. You'd think that a fresh couple would want nothing but to spend time together, but in practice excursions like today proved the exception and not the rule so far.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In light of the dramatic events that transpired, we've agreed that giving eachother some space would be a smart thing to do. Probably. Stella could smooth things out with Rosa, and I could avoid getting my neck snapped by Naser. And uh, make sure that Fang was okay too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella and I would still meet in school and talk on the phone in the evenings, but we didn't want to give more fuel to the rumor mill. Going back to the dorms wasn't really an option, Rosa and her had to practically smuggle me in last weekend so we could watch anime. Almost every student have heard some retelling of the story too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In some of them I somehow managed to score both Stella AND Fang, at the same time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not bad.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But uh, in some others they claim that I personally wanted to kill Stella and had to be detained by the guards. I have no idea where THAT came from.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In any case, we could scarcely talk to eachother at school without random students sneering at us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm just glad that the others are more or less off the hook. Fang was getting dogwhistles for a while, but Naser and Trish - though independently - saw to the end of those. I'm willing to bet that Spears weighed in there too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rosa and Reed weren't really getting a single look, even though they're spending an increasing amount of time together.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Who could have thought?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I would be happy for them, if Reed wasn't otherwise distant... From everyone, really. He barely talks to me, to Fang, to Trish, to anyone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel pretty shitty about that, cause it no doubt has to do with him backing me up throughout the whole ordeal. It hurts to see him estranged from his friends, even though his exile is one-sided.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or maybe I'm just reading too much into it, and he's normal when I'm not around. I could just be paranoid too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, I'm eighty percent sure I'm paranoid about Fang anyway, cause she seems... Fine?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She must have suffered the most, and yet she's doing fine holding up her end of the deal. We still talk and joke around - mostly her - like nothing happened.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't help but feel that this is an act.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The worst part is that I can't fault her for it. Like what? "Hey Fang, why are you hiding things from your ex that lied to you and cheated on you? Oh, you also have feelings for him? Nah, that'll blow over don't worry."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then again, it was my support and not like, my dick that she needed most. If I keep being her friend, things may actually turn out fine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not that being her friend will be easy. Besides the obvious, whereas before all this Trish only wished that I was dead, she now refuses to acknowledge my existence in any way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This might actually be the best possible outcome, really.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naomi could join her too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">God, I hope those two didn't hear about Stella and me eavesdropping on their rooftop shenanigans.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Guh!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm rudely shaken out of my thoughts as the bus crosses over a bumpy segment. My only consolation is seeing Stella's moderate titties bounce under her bikini top.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm instinctively reminded of how soft they've felt under my touch that one time. A memory that I have, erm, "relived" many evenings now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Right, where was I?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Uhhh...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anyway, most everyone that isn't Stella can eat shit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a second I consider correcting myself to "everyone that isn't Stella or me", but uh... I deserve to eat shit too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess I'll just have to come to terms with the fact that I'm still a no-good liar with the emotional maturity of a jealous six-year-old. I try not to show my struggle on the outside too much. Forcing myself to eat too, and all that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's not, like, a deep pit of depression anyway. I feel happy when I'm with Stella. But when I'm alone these thoughts keep crowding into my mind. The last few nights I've been laying in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering how she could even trust me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...okay, it might be depression. Let's call it, uh... Self-doubt? Having some of that is healthy, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't dwell on that for long though, as the PA announces that we'll arrive at the beach in a few minutes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella grabs my hand with a happy yelp. A week back this gesture would've had me sweating profusely, but now it feels natural.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Mostly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oooohh, I've been waiting all week for this!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Really? Aren't you sad that you're gonna miss this week's episode?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I have keikaku."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I still haven't gotten fully accustomed to her wapanese, but at least I can keep the cringe on the inside.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh yeah? What's that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Um, like a plan."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah I... I know what... I mean what's your plan?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh um..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She blushes suddenly, her tail trailing up on her leg.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've learned that a tail curl can mean a few things. Usually along the lines of embarrassment, excitement, or coziness. Probably the first one this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I thought maybe we could watch it at your place afterwards? I could totally crash the weekend too."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh no.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I knew that sooner or later it would come to this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've been trying to hide the fact that I live in Skin Row the best I could, but I guess no more of that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or... Maybe if I stall her at the beach somehow, and we "accidentally" forget about the episode? It's not like she can't catch a rerun or torrent it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel kinda bad about it, but... I'm just not ready yet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah, sure."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The rest of the ride goes by uneventfully. We make smalltalk as Stella rests her head on my shoulder - which feels amazing by the way -, but nothing overly exciting. I half expected her to go on a tangent about this or that series, but I guess we both just want to make the heat go away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hope the beach won't be overcrowded. I'm still not sure how Stella roped me into showing off my lanklet body.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Alas, half the city seems to be gathered out here. Some of them I recognize from school, surrounded by their friends. Older folks too. But worst of all, families. Families with annoying fucking children running all around on a sugar high. Children who revel in pulling your boxers down and force you to go home naked, Solid Snake style.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Er, maybe that last part isn't all that common.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We find a more or less secluded area behind a few trees - not coincidentally far from the actual beach - and lay down a blanket.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella produces a few things from her basket. Some fruit, a couple of sandwiches, sunblock, so on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Man... Now I feel like a dick for literally only bringing myself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The last item is an inflatable swimming ring, which she immediately throws at me. I take my cue and get to inflating it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The rubber turns out to be quite big. Thankfully it's plain orange, and not covered with kanji or cutouts from hentai doujins, as I would have expected from Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Meanwhile, Stella applies the sunblock on herself. The way she spreads the cream all over her tail is unbelievably cute.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She finishes about the same time as I do, turning her back to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Could you do the rest for me?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh boy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sure."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Okay Anon, just don't get a boner now. Steady.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I drop the now inflated toy and take the sunblock from her, squirting a generous amount of it into my palm.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her scales are pretty hot to the touch, even though we're in shade right now. I guess this heat is getting to everyone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to spread it around the best I can, painting her whole back white around the plates.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At the end I consider a surprise boob-grab from behind, but I conclude that today should be about harmless fun. Plus I don't want to accidentally faceplant a kid with my hard-on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...Jesus that was a really fucked up thought what is wrong with me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, I've already risked being labeled an offender this month.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"All done."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Thanks, Anon!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She rewards me with an awkward kiss.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh god, it's my turn now huh?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Alright... The jacket comes off first.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It would be so much easier if she wasn't looking at me... Then again, it fills me with pride that a girl is curious about my body.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At least till I start fumbling around with my shirt like the dork that I am. I'm so sweaty that it sticks to me like a vice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Goddammit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With one last jank, I free myself of my burden. The light breeze hitting my skin feels nice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Midst my retardation, Stella's already got the floating rubber around her waist.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">God, how can this girl always one-up her cuteness?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I sunblock myself up, then we pack the rest of the stuff back into the basket and make our way for the water.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once we're far enough in that the ear piercing screams of playing children can barely be heard, Stella pulls herself up to lay across the ring, and I just simply cling onto the side while enjoying the cool water.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We stay like that for a bit, silent, save for the splashing I make to cover her belly with water and her giggles in response.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After a while she grabs my hand, looking like she actually has something important to say.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She doesn't speak up, but no matter. I know that something's up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Um... Don't you think that it's weird that we still call eachother by name? I mean... S-shouldn't I call you like, s-sweetie or something?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Huh. I can feel my cheeks turning red.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I-I don't know?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What did you call eachother with Fang?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh... It was like..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She called me dweeb a lot."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't really expect that Fang would come up today. The water suddenly feels colder around me, laying renewed pressure on my chest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try not to show it. Stella doesn't realize her error either, and I'm quite thankful for that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Aww, that's so mean. But I guess she'd be like that now."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Like that now? What do you mean by now?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh um... She used to be different."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I want to ask, but she quickly interjects.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's not really for me to say."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I just shake my head at her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh, no, Stella. You don't just drop something like that. Come on."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She fidgets around for a bit, unsure what to make of the situation. I'm almost about to let it goes as she caves.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fine, but you didn't hear from me, okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah sure."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She um, she used to be like um... Girly? And like, super religious."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Couldn't have guessed that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Right? I mean, how do you think we've got to be- f-friends...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She cuts herself off awkwardly, probably realizing that she couldn't very well call herself Fang's buddy anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The thought puts a bitter taste in my mouth too, so I try to distract her with more splashing. It kinda works, but the air definitely stays thick with awkwardness for a good while.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We stay in the water for the better part of two hours, talking about series' and characters we like, planning more dates, so on. It's actually quite pleasant once we forget about the other topic.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the middle of one of my various rants, Stella starts shifting around nervously.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"A-Anon, I gotta pee."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay? I'll wait for you here."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Could you come with me?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Uh, what?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh, what?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So that nobody else comes in?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't they have like, stalls?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I... I can't if there's someone next to me. Or in the room."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I know that I'm a dick, but I couldn't suppress chuckling even I wanted to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry. Yeah, sure. Let's go."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We zig-zag our way through the crowd and hastility get to the toilets. Thankfully, Stella knows where they are.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's a small wooden building, with separate doors for the two genders on opposing sides.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After making sure that nobody's there, Stella hands me the inflatable rubber and hurries inside as I guard the door for her. Then it strikes me that I have no idea what to say if someone actually wants to enter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Claim that it's occupied? Like, I don't know how many stalls are in there but all of them occupied? How would I even know that it's full? Not like I'm waiting in line.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As the minutes pass, I keep asking myself why it takes so long for girls to pee. This is a nightmare.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just as I'm about to start hyperventilating, Stella appears through the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Thanks, s-swee--tie..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like that, with an awkward pause in the middle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I blush nonetheless. Being called sweetie by someone other than my grandma feels surprisingly nice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She hugs me too, which I find weird at first - what, like two feet from the toilets - but then I realize that it probably took her effort to even ask. Plus I didn't refuse or make her feel overly weird about it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I was more or less understanding about her weirdness, and that's almost exactly what she said she's looking for in a boyfriend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Squeezing her body close to mine, I'm just happy that I can make her happy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's still early afternoon, so we take some time to down a couple of sandwiches Stella has made.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm simply enamored with watching her wet scales, especially around her chest. But like, I try to not make my staring obvious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Afterwards we lay down on the blanket, cuddling under the pleasant shade of the trees.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Really, with how much I was fussing about coming here, I can't deny the simple calming joy of just lazeing around with Stella. Makes me wonder if she took any of her quote un-quote boyfriends here, or if I'm the first.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Do you come here a lot? Looked like you know your way around the place."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Not really. I've been a few times with Rosa and the gardening club."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Not even like, with your parents?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We're not from the area. You know, that's why dorms and stuff."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Makes sense.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Have you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nah, this is my first time. It's kinda nice, sucks that there are so many people."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She just shrugs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I don't mind them."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh, how come? I thought you would want to be away from the people that think you're weird."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She takes some time to formulate a response. Her face gets all serious too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I don't want you to be the only person I can feel normal around."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I know that I'm not good with people, but I'm trying. We'll graduate soon, so we can't keep running away from them and be outcasts forever."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So please, don't see me as this loser who always needs to be looked after."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's an interesting train of thought from someone unable to go to the bathroom alone. I can see her point though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Doesn't keep me from feeling jealous about it, that she wants me to be just one of many. I don't have any desires like that. Not like I'm not already an outcast.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At least I have enough self-awareness to know that this is a me issue. She's right that we'll need to be normal eventually.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I see."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She climbs on top of my chest, resting her breasts on it and looking down at me with a flustered smile.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey, I didn't want to be mean. And I know that you're just looking out for me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She gives me a quick peck on the lips, though before she could retreat I push my head forward, deepening the kiss.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella seems a little surprised, but welcomes my advancement. She pulls back only as the kiss would have turned into a full-on make out session.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We look at one another, panting a touch. At some point, her tail curled up along one of my legs too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wanna go for another swim?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Eh, sure. Dibs on the thing."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She giggles at that but doesn't protest, jumping up giddily and skipping towards the water. I watch her go with a dumb grin ear to ear, but stay back to check on my phone real quick.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My heart sinks as the screen lights up, prominently displaying a few missed calls from none other than Fang. Couple of texts too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She hasn't messaged me since... Well, since then.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh fuck me, this definitely won't be good.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You coming?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look back at Stella with a troubled expression.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah uh, gimme a sec."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hesitate for a moment, my thumb hovering over the notification badge.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, what the hell...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"hey loser"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"i need u"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"4 science shit :V"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"come over tmrw"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"w8 no"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"ill go over"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I quickly check the timestamp and with great relief confirm that the messages are from today, and Fang isn't currently waiting for me somewhere in the middle of Skin Row. The mental image of her getting shanked in an alley isn't a pleasant one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, this is all coming out of nowhere.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What is it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't even notice Stella sneaking up behind me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Unable to speak with the lump growing in my throat, I hand her the phone. All sorts of colorful possibilities race through my mind as she reads the messages.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, okay. Maybe I'm the biggest retard ever and Fang simply needs help with her homework. But she knows smarter people than me. Reed, for instance. Her parents should have no problem with him going over either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And what's up with the calls?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean yeah, we didn't cut off contact, but... These past two weeks we didn't meet unless we had to cause of class or something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even when we got her to hang out with us, it was just the three of us sitting around awkwardly, twiddling our thumbs and shit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Could this be a plot? Maybe she's bringing Naser or Trish to beat me up, or her father to arrest me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Though that latter one would be much easier if I went over to their place instead.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe she wants us to be alone and have a heart to heart about the situation? We never really did talk it over.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My heart skips a beat as I consider that she could also have more sinister, shady, and intimate intentions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She shoots me a quizzical glance, which confuses me greatly. Doesn't she see the problem?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I uh... D-Don't you think it's weird?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She shrugs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She had to get over it eventually."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Get over it. Wow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just wow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...I guess..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh come on, Anon! Fang coming over could be really nice, we could have a small party or something. Get drunk and stuff?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Raptor Jesus, who is this girl and what did she do with the real Stella? I'm so shocked by her question that my former worries disappear in an instant.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Seriously?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her cheeks redden and she looks away with a bashful expression, accompanied by her trademark tail curl. Although, this time I'm sure it's from embarrassment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah um, I mean... Why not?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What, other than not being 21? And having an ex over, alongside the girl I've cheated with on said ex? And that I'm a huge autist trying to hide his powerlevel? Yeah, what could go wrong?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then again, I don't want to be the no fun allowed guy. Maybe we could even get Fang to open up a little.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ffffffffffine. I know a place we could score some beer."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Such are the perks of living in Skin Row.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Truth be told, I'm getting cautiously amped here. Dare I say hyped? Getting shitfaced drunk with Stella sounds like one hell of a good time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not the Fang part, but like... Yeah, we can figure that out too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After replying some neutral sounding stuff to Fang we get a quick dip in as planned, playing around in the water. Next time we should bring a ball or frisbee or something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sadly, my stall tactic proves fruitless as Stella keeps on keenly watching the time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Soon, we're back on the bus. Treading water all day has tired us out adequately, our bodies slumped together into an amorphous blob of scales and manflesh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It sounds dumb, but being pressed together and supported by eachother really makes it feels as if the "Stella and I" finally turned into "us".</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm not sure how to feel about that. It would be an outrageous lie to say that I'm not happy, but... It wasn't that long ago since I've thought the same about Fang. And in the end I...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No. Let's not go down that road now. Let's just enjoy the feeling for what it is.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I stroke Stella's hair gently, to which she replies with satisfied humming.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Did you have a good time, sweetie?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I chuckle at my new nickname, still sounding so foreign.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, it was nice I guess."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We can come again, if you'd like."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sure, let's do that. Next week?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sounds like a date!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her warm smile is all the reward I ever needed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We spend the rest of the ride exchanging pleasantries, and almost falling asleep. Luckily we don't forget to get off a few stops early to get da booze.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I end up buying two six-packs. Should be more than enough for the three of us, even if we were to drink some of it this very evening. And I only need to pay an extra fifty percent, what a bargain!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My worries regarding Fang return to haunt me, but they're short lived. Stella is keeping me plenty distracted.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Especially as I awkwardly usher her into the dilapidated commie block that I call home, and up the stairs to my apartment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She doesn't comment on the water damaged walls that miss more than half of the wallpaper, nor the rats scurrying about in the hallway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I just hope she's not thinking about how to dump me with the least effort, now that she's seen my true colors.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't really read her face. She looks serious, a little worried, maybe even a bit afraid. Still, she won't let go of my hand, for which I'm thankful.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We reach my door in a minute or two. I open the multitude locks that miraculously haven't been cracked yet - or so I hope -, and let Stella inside.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In here it's much nicer than the spartan misery that is the rest of the building. There's carpeting, windows that aren't broken, and even the cracks in the walls are limited to a minimum. This seems to put Stella at ease somewhat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She looks around the main room silently, peeking into the kitchen and bathroom, then returning to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's not... That bad..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can tell that she's trying to be nice on my behalf, and not show her pity.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, I know."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm not really sure what to say, inspecting the room as if I saw it for the first time as well.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Are you going to leave?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Now that you know I'm poor as fuck, are you gonna leave?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She looks genuinely surprised at the insinuation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, I-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She drops her basket, embracing me tightly and burrowing her head under my chin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I had no idea that you have to live like this."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But that doesn't change anything. I still lo-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...still like you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The fact that she almost said love doesn't escape me, causing my heartbeat to quicken.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All my stupid fears about Stella seeing my living conditions, and there, her feelings for me might be stronger than I previously thought.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sounds like she's confused by that herself, but in all honesty, I'm glad that she's gotten more serious since our earlier escapades and isn't coming onto me like a drunk prom date anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I return the tight hug, kissing her forehead softly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We stay like that for a while, up until Stella loosens her embrace enough so she can look me in the eye.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I expect her to say something, but instead she starts scanning the room, only content once she spots my bed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She looks back at me with a mischievous, coy smile.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh god, she can't mean...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not that I wouldn't love to, well, love her, but the last time we tried didn't exactly go smoothly. Even if we discount being found semi-naked by Rosa the next morning. And everything that followed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Are you sure it's a good idea?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on sweetie, don't you want to fuck your bad bitch?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her words are merely a whisper, if her face wasn't so close to mine I surely wouldn't have heard them. So much for that whole not-a-drunk-prom-date thing, but DAMN if it wasn't the hottest fucking thing anyone has ever said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Our lips and tongues find eachoter and all the exhaustion dissipates from our bodies, giving way to lust and desire.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We stumble to the bed, very nearly falling over Stella's basket in the process. The passionate string of kisses pauses only for the shortest of seconds so we can gasp for air, like fish stranded on land.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I make fast work of undoing her bikini top, eliciting a muffled gasp from her. Long were the days I waited for hot dino tiddy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I sit her down on the mattress, standing in front of her to take my shirt off. Past experience has taught me to get naked BEFORE getting on the bed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Taking one last look at her before I pull my shirt over my head, I can see her already making a beeline towards my stomach.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Whilst I'm blinded by the fabric she plants a kiss just above my belt buckle, breathing hot air onto my skin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She then ventures lower, gently, ever so gently pecking at my growing member through my pants, covering it with more and more kisses.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">God fucking damn it Stella, you're driving me fucking crazy here!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I toss my shirt aside, adrenaline and probably a dozen other hormones that I can't name buzzing around in my body, urging me to get my pants off posthaste.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She giggles at my enthusiasm, reaching out with one hand so she can get to work as soon as I free the beast. With the other she traces a line from her mouth and in between her breasts, down to her nether regions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Looks like it's not only me that can't handle the tension.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In a few moments, I stand before her stark naked. Well except for my socks cause I find that I both don't care and that it would be awkward to make her wait even more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She latches onto me almost instantly, tugging on it with a deliberately slow teasing motion as she guides me to her mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So sweetie, what would you like me to do?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She asks in a lewd tone, making very sure that her soft lips and tongue brush up against the tip as she speaks. She doesn't stop her slow jerking motion either, in fact, her grip tightens for a brief moment with every other stroke.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I know exactly what I would want her to do, but speaking it out loud is another matter entirely...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My already reddened cheeks draw a few shades deeper as I try to stutter as little as I can.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I w-wantyou to s-suckmydick..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So much for my confidence. I practically murmur the whole thing, half my words meshed together into a jumble of madness.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Aww, I didn't catch that..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She feigns a mock-surprised tone, again doing that thing with her lips touching me just slightly. This time her hand stops though, maybe that's her way of urging me on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of which I need little, albeit instead of words I use my own hands.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I move one hand to her chin, fixating her head in place and touching her lower lip with my thumb - that's a thing normal people do, right? With the other I grab my cock, making extra sure that I don't miss my target as I thrust forward slowly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A soft moan escapes my lips. Oh god, this is fucking amazing...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm not really sure how deep I should go though. Like... Well she's not gagging on it, so that means it's okay, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With me in the lead Stella has closed her eyes already and I can't tell if she's being overwhelmed or not. How hard can it be to suck a dick?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a second I consider jamming a few of my fingers down my own throat to see, but I realize that this might not be the right time to be retarded.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I decide that around half is good enough and release her head from my grip, instead pushing down on it in encouragement.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She takes her cue and soon wet slurping sounds fill the room, mixed with my sighs and moans.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh sweet baby Raptor Jesus, this girl is gonna kill me...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take to inspecting the cracks on the ceiling to distract myself from the intense feeling lest I cut the fun short.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She probably has something like that on her mind too cause only rarely does she go down all the way, making our second time a lot different than the desperate sloppy blowjob she gave me on the roof.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I do notice, however, that she's using her long tongue to form a tight ring around my cock, which... Well honestly that's gross as fuck, but it feels way too nice for me to complain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In any case I back off, pulling myself from her mouth with the loudest popping sound that I've heard yet. A long, heavy strand of saliva drops to the floor and my socks, making me wonder if it would have been better if I took them off when I had the chance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So, how was that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She gets up on her knees, making us more or less eye level. Also coincidentally putting my junk right under her palm, and she doesn't hesitate for a second to get to jerking me off again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel outright pampered, embarrassed that I haven't pleasured her yet one bit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In lieu of answering her, I go in for a kiss. Not a very deep one now that her mouth smells of my dick, but a pleasant one nonetheless. Furthermore I try using it as a distraction and push her down onto the bed, under me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But uh, I didn't really consider the logistics of tails and other dino extremities. She tries her best to accommodate my advances, though ultimately we end up in an awkward half-squat thing straight out of a game of Twister.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Could you um... Would you mind if I, uh--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Can I be on top? It's just..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She lifts her tail in an explanatory manner, blushing cutely. It's amusing to see the contrast between her kinky side and the regular girly-girl Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah, sure..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I comply, letting go of her and laying down on the bed. She takes the opportunity to get rid of her drenched panties, straddling me afterwards.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Immediately I cup one of her perky breasts and we settle into a slow, passionate grind, not yet penetrating her. Somewhere along the way I get up on my elbow, allowing us to get locked in a kiss again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even though she was playing her bad bitch role earlier, I can tell that she's getting nervous. Her muscles tense up, her already rugged breaths cut short.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait. That's not being nervous. Is she actually--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't even finish the thought before her claws dig into my skin and she presses her mouth onto mine, challenging my tongue without a care that I may not enjoy the taste of my own cock. Her frame shudders and our movement get more and more erratic.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I ride the climax out with her, trying to make it as enjoyable for Stella as I can. Not that I have the slightest idea about what is helpful in this kind of situation and what isn't, I'm just doing what feels right. Which is, grabbing her ass.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She slows down after a few more seconds, slumping down onto my chest. Her lithe body seems to have finally run out of juice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hold her sweaty body close to mine, once again caressing her hair like on the bus earlier. My still hard member is pressed up between our warm bodies, which feels both nice and irritating cause I haven't got off yet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Although currently I'm perfectly content feeling her scales on my skin, her heaving breath dancing around my neck. Having either of us come is a huge step up since our last attempt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sh... Shit, Ano-n... You didn't..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's okay."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ahh..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She lets out a huge sigh, trying to get up but failing to do so.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ugh, I'm done."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We stay like for a couple of minutes, both to enjoy the feeling of post-coital closeness and to let Stella catch her breath.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The warmth of her body and its tender movement as her lungs expand with each breath, the strong beat of her heart, the scent of her hair... If I could I'd embed this memory so deep into my skull that even on my deathbed I'd remember it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And yet somehow it all feels... Unearned? It's all too strange, too sudden.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've gotten closer to Stella than anyone else in my life, both physically and emotionally. Still, there's this nagging feeling in the back of my mind, one that makes me question if this is what I really wanted. I couldn't recall a time I've felt happier, more whole, but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It wasn't my choice, for things to end up like this. I know very well that I caused it, I let Stella close. Were I able to keep it in my pants that one evening, and probably I would still be with Fang. Maybe she'd be the one laying on top of me right now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try my best to banish these thoughts, returning to the present to my very real and loving girlfriend. Maybe us getting together happened for all the wrong reasons, but that doesn't mean that our feelings aren't real, or that this relationship isn't worth fighting for.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella is the first to let the moment end, rolling off of me with a sleepy yawn. I'm a bit disappointed for having been blue-balled, but it's not like this is the last time we're ever gonna have sex.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"C'mere."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She reaches for me, offering her behind for spooning. From this angle I can see that her usually neat buns have gotten loose, now arranged in a mess of sticky hair strands all over her back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shift to my side embracing her - carefully bending her back-plates away -, and slipping my semi-hard member between her buttcheeks, causing her to giggle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her tail curls up along one of my legs, which in return elicits a giggle from me. I pull her body as close to mine as I can, careful not to somehow hurt her back. I have little to no idea how flexible her plates are.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Slowly we drift to sleep, giving up on our plans to watch anime and get drunk.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The next day we wake around noon, still a little exhausted after our day at the beach and subsequent attempt at sex. Though after having skipped dinner, we couldn't just laze around all day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We sluggishly crawl out of bed, but not before Stella offers a "good morning blowjob" to make amends for leaving me hanging yesterday. I pass on the opportunity, already too anxious about having Fang over today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We cook up some breakfast from the very limited food supply that I keep in the fridge, scrambled eggs for both. Makes me wonder about dinos and eggs, but I don't bring it up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I do note to myself though that I should really brush up on my dino anatomy, now that I'm getting intimate with one. Can't afford to be a liability.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Also, not that I ever came close to coming inside her, but I wouldn't want to accidentally knock her up. Does Stella know how that works? She didn't seem to care that we're missing protection.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her voice tears me out of my inane daydreaming.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I can't believe we missed yesterday's episode..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nobody told you to go to sleep."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I tease her with a grin and shrug, to which she replies by sticking her tongue at me in mock anger.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She looks incredibly cute when annoyed, puffing her cheeks out. Her messy morning hairdo makes it all better too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nobody told YOU to tire me out like that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh yeah? Well nobody--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't finish my sentence, suddenly being pelted with pieces of scrambled eggs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, so that's how it is? Food fight, is it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I flick a bigger piece towards her forehead, though missing my target completely.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Didn't anyone teach you not to play with your food?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She giggles, already shoveling more eggs onto her fork.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Our battle lasts for a few minutes, alternating between banter and using our respective forks as makeshift catapults. Once the table and surrounding floor is completely covered with bits and pieces of our breakfast we announce a truce, complete with a confirmation kiss and all that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella graciously offers to clean up on the condition that I get to pirating the episode for her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sure, I can do that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The plan is to watch it in the evening after Fang leaves, so we can tidy up the place till she arrives.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...I'm expecting more sexy bamboozles there, not that a choice between watching SAO and making love is a difficult one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, my worries keep me distracted all day, up till three in the afternoon when Fang makes her appearance. It's VERY awkward at first, I'm not even sure if she knew Stella would be here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, I didn't explicitly tell her, but she was here most weekends too while we were dating.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After the initial hamming and hawing we settle into a good rhythm going through the science homework. Fang seems dedicated to solving the problems - despite me doing most of the work -, for which I am grateful.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even after Stella brings out the drinks, things remain more or less normal. Just another hangout with friends.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It surely helps though that Stella is keeping the relationship drama to a minimum, we maybe kissed twice in all these hours, if that. Also that Fang and her kept their distance, sitting on opposing ends of my desk with me in the middle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't not notice however, that as the bottles keep getting emptier, so the girls' tongues loosen. As if both of them tried to prove who "deserves" me, or simply who's better altogether.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After one particular exercise Fang goes out of her way to bolster how smart I am - though in her usual banter tone -, and subtly suggesting that I must be sooo lucky to have Stella who must be equally genius cause why else would I be with her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella replies with something along the lines of a smart boy like me really does know how to choose the right partner, prominently grabbing my hand on the table in full view of Fang, who, afterall, isn't allowed to do that anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't say that I'm a fan of being used as fodder, nor about the girls getting increasingly nasty to eachother. I try to laugh these off or otherwise distract the opponents, but the mental catfight keeps going on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The worst came after Stella excused herself to the bathroom and Fang stood by my side as we started on the next problem.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She downs another bottle then scoots closer to me, running her pale arm along my shoulder and massaging it gently.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Now that's a big fucking red flag if I've ever seen one. I remain calm, er, try to at least, and focus on the paper on the desk.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang, as if nothing was going on urges me on. She's already slurring her words a bit, prompting me to send a prayer to whatever deity, semi-god, or saint to let today not end in a drunken brawl.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Commonn dweeeeb, do your thannngggg."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can faintly hear the bathroom door opening as Stella finishes with her business.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I move my sweating hand over the sheet, pencil in hand, when in a sudden motion Fang disappears from my side.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"YOU FUCKING BITCH!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I turn around as soon as I can, unable to believe the scene my eyes report to my slightly drunk brain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's Stella, mad as fuck, pulling Fang backwards by her fucking wings, tearing feathers as she does.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then there's Fang, surprised, trying to keep her balance as Stella shoves her against a wall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck, I didn't even know she had this much strength in her. Then again I've heard Rosa and her talk about how gardening builds muscle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shake the irrelevant thought from my head and rush towards the girls as the initial shock fades.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I grab onto Stella before she could further harm Fang, standing between the two of them. From the corner of my eye I see that Fang just barely manages to not fall flat on her ass, supporting herself on a shelf.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stella stop! What the fuck are you doing?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She janks her hand away, stepping back. Her eyes are filled with rage, and I'm not sure anymore towards whom is it directed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why are you taking her side Anon?! I am your girlfriend and not that slut!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before I could react Fang shoves me out of the way, stepping to Stella and poking her square in the chest with a finger. She's deadass mad too, yet she seems more collected than Stella. More shocked than angry.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Who yyyou calling sluttt, sluttt? Immnotthe one to sssuck erry dick in the school then prannncce around breaking up relationships!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She what? I-I refuse to believe that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella slaps Fang's hand away, though before things could escalate further I pick them apart once again. I shoot Fang a serious stare directing her to keep her mouth shut, then turn to Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm not taking any sides, but why the fuck did you just do that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Didn't you see that bitch oogling at you all night? OH! Or maybe you liked that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stella, she wasn't the only--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Then I come back, and she's all over you, and flipping me off behind you back!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To emphasize her point she throws a middle finger right in my face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Whatthe fffuck r'you talking about? Fucking crazy peiccc of shittt!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She tries to get to Stella again, who in return is already raising her fist.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And that's the point I decide that this shit ends. Right. Now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I push Fang forcefully backwards with one hand, and grab Stella by her shirt with the other, dragging her to the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We can talk about this tomorrow. You're drunk. Go home."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She fights me all the way, clawing at my chest and neck, but I don't waver. In the end her resistance turns to desperation, and she gives me the most heartbroken puppy eyes from the hallway before I shut the door on her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, you have to believe me! Don't you trust--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I slam the door in her face, fed up with the entire situation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the silence that follows I can clearly hear her beginning to cry, then run away. I seriously consider going after her, but I will not encourage or accept this kind of behavior.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, the pain in my chest is almost enough to cause me to tear up as well. My shoulders drop, my head bangs against the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I stay like that for a good minute or two, thinking about what I've done.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hear footsteps behind me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey, you okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her voice is soft, and surprisingly clear. Not a single slurred vowel.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh no...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My voice is little more than a whisper, I can barely force the word out as-is.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang rests a hand on my clawed shoulder, but I barely register the pain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sorry."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sorry? How fucking sorry could she be after staging that fight?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I turn to her, furious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Are you?! I'm sure you must have enjoyed me throwing my own girlfriend out. Cause guess what?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You're."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Not."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anymore."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With each word I stab a finger onto her forehead, as if I could imprint the thought in her brain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She looks away with a pained expression, her wings deflating behind her back. The spots where Stella grabbed her are still clearly visible.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even if she wanted to say something, I'm not giving her the chance. Instead I keep shouting in her face, blinded by white hot rage.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How long were you planning this? Did you need to be such a bitch to her? Are you even drunk?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I only stop the torrent of blame as I notice the ache in my shoulder. I run a few fingers over it, hissing as ache turns to a burning sensation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fuck!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella's fighting for the truth left its mark, her claws drew deep canals of blood all over my left shoulder and the side of my neck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang notices it too, reaching for my arm gently.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Let me help... Please..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's obviously fighting to keep her composure, but there's genuine worry in her voice. I really fucking don't care for any of that right now though. Truth be told, I consider tossing her ass out onto the street too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Christ, just imagining Stella crying her eyes out in some dark alley is enough to twist the knife in my gut.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Instead of answering Fang I ask her one last question, more calm than before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Did you really flip her off?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"-No."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's an ever so slight pause, a brief moment of hesitation before her answer. If it was any shorter I'd swear that I imagined it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The way it is though, I know that she's lying. The Stella I know would never pick a fight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All of my remaining strength leaves my body, and with a groan I sit down on the desk. Whatever spine I thought I had up till today, it's gone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I close my eyes, thinking about the situation. Even if I started looking for Stella now, right now, the chances of finding her are slim.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could call her, but I doubt that she'd answer. It's not a conversation I'd have over the phone either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could- No. I SHOULD send Fang away, but... I just don't want to be alone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fine..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I motion for Fang to come help, taking off my bloodied shirt. Stella really did a number on me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Shit Anon, you're bleeding all over the place."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, she's not wrong. With my shirt off, blood is now flowing freely down my arm in thick crimson rivers, making a mess of the homework we just did.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm starting to feel a little lightheaded too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fuck. Okay. To the bathroom, come on!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She helps me up, supporting me with her shoulder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">These fucking dino girls are all stronger than they look.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We limp over to the bathroom, and Fang sits me down on the side of the tub.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stay like that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...Okay..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I watch her go through my cupboards till she finds a first aid kit that I didn't even know I had.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She presses some gauze onto the biggest wound, causing me to flinch in pain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry, sorry! Please stay still..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She tries again, and I grit my teeth through the immense burning feeling as my exposed flesh rubs against the cloth. She quickly tapes it to my skin, then moves to another cut, then onto another, and so on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My blood soaks through the first gauze after a few minutes. I try to remove it so Fang can put up fresh bandaging, but she pulls my hand away. Gently, but forcefully.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No! Leave that. I'll put more over it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her clear expertise reminds me that her father is supposedly some police higher-up or something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look into the mirror, mutely following her movements. Some of the bigger cuts need double-wrapping too, but the bleeding stops after a while.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once she's content with her work, Fang again goes over each wound, starting with the smaller ones this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She carefully cleans them with warm water one by one, seemingly not caring that her scales and arm-feathers are getting drenched with my blood.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Being in Fang's care reminds me of the times we spent in this flat, however few they were. Even with how bad the world got, there's some serenity in being alone with her. A silence that nobody needs to fill.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A certain spot in my heart aches for these times to return. But I know that I've gone way too far for that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sorry."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh, for what?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She doesn't even look up from her work at first, her question is kinda absent-minded too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once she does, once she looks into my eyes I know that she understands what I mean.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We stay like that for a bit, neither of us speaking up. Me, sitting on the tub like the bleeding drunk idiot that I am, and Fang kneeling before me, the messy cloth in her hand, dripping with water and blood.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's the first to look away, continuing her work.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Before, I... I wanted you to see her for who she really is."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You didn't know her for as long as I have. No guy could stand her for more than a month."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...Not that many tried seriously anyway, they just wanted a good BJ or two."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And she was dumb enough to give it to them."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sucked all dicks in the school, huh? I still don't want to believe that, but I know that Fang wouldn't need to lie about it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella confessed to me that she never really could find the right guy, I just... I didn't think it was that bad.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But then... Why did you let me go with her?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, you..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You cheated on me. What was I supposed to do?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's no blame in her voice, she's just stating facts. It makes me feel terrible all the same.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, she doesn't stop tending to my cuts. She's probably finishing up soon, applying disinfectant and putting band-aids on the smaller ones, fresh layers of gauze on all the others.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Silence settles over us anew, only broken by the drops of water collecting on the floor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once she's done, Fang overviews her work with pride. I wouldn't say that I feel a lot better, but I probably would have fainted already if she didn't stop the bleeding.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She puts the first-aid kit aside, then sits beside me on the tub. She doesn't look at me, instead playing with one of her feathers fallen into a puddle of blood, pushing it around with her feet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Do you still wanna be with her?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I give a dry chuckle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You think she'd still have me?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You think she'd find better?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My knee-jerk reaction would be "yes", with how much of a dick I've been today.

The first genuine one I've seen for a while.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It warms the place where my heart would be, if only it wasn't already shattered to pieces, scattered to the wind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a second her hand hovers towards mine, and I can't find it in me to stop her or move away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the end she changes her mind, getting up from the tub.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright Anon, I'll clean up here. Go, shoo!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I think about saying something, or hugging her, kissing her. But I don't. Instead I oblige, leaving her to mop the various fluids from the floor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She takes a quick shower afterwards. Part of me hopes that this means she'll stay the night, so seeing her return with clothes on turns my already foul mood that much more sour.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I escort her to the door, though we end up idling there for a while. I know that I don't want her to leave, and she probably doesn't want to go either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But whatever we wanted our relationship to be, I've gone ahead and cut our options to zero.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a sigh she moves on to the hallway, only turning back for a quick farewell.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Take care, okay?

I can't deal with this right now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I reach for the nearest bottle on the desk, the one Stella was drinking from I think, but in my hazed state I only manage to knock it off of the table.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fuck!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I let the beverage seep into the carpet, and instead go for the very next opened bottle. This time I manage to grab it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Immediately I bring it up to my mouth, chugging its contents down with loud gulps.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My thoughts are all over the place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm simultaneously happy that Fang would still take a chance on me, ashamed that I want her to, fearful for what Stella might think - IF she didn't decide to dump me already -, and dreading having to make a decision about it at all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Last time something like this happened it cost me my friends, cost me my girlfriend, my barely existent reputation, and very nearly ruined the rest of my life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You'd think I learn from my mistakes...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As soon as the bottle empties I open another, downing it too. I'm spilling beer left and right, but I don't care.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Gathering up as much alcohol as I can, I make my way to the bathroom again. I really have to concentrate on what I'm doing, my vision slowly but surely losing its focus, the apartment spinning wildly around me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I grab my phone too, on the off chance that Stella would call me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or if I need to call an ambulance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After that I strip down to boxers only, and take residence in the still wet bathtub. Gonna need a shower in the morning anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">From there I proceed to drink myself unconscious, eager to drown out all remaining splinters of reason, guilt, and doubt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reed]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fucking finally!

There are more lenient teachers than others, suffice it to say.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I push through the crowd of the freshly freed students, making my way to the entrace.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just as I thought, a familair figure is waving at me already. Seeing her face lifs my mood greatly, and I find myself smiling like an idiot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ready to go?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've agreed to walk her home, unsure of how that might end for me. Never easy, meeting with the parents.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We hug it up for a bit, making idle smalltalk about our days and such.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Soon we're out on the sidewalk, with cars flashing us by. I'm holding her hand, fingers intertwined.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't ever want to let her go, that's all I know. The look in her bright, lovely eyes suggests that she feels the same way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Very gallantly I took on the burden of carrying her bag too. She fought me a bit on that, proclaiming that she can carry her own bag just right, though I suspect she secretely appreciates the gesture.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The two straps bite into my shoulder painfully, although it's a very mild pain. More annoyance than a real issue.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All about sacrifices, I am today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A loud truck passes us by, covering the street in smoke. Wow, what an asshole.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even after it's long gone we can still hear the buzz of its engine. Scrap that rusbucket already, geez!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We make a few jokes about the guy as we make our way to her neighbourhood.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm determined that no one will ruin my mood today. Luckily I have a stubborn companion to help with that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Though as their door closes in on us I'm met with a sudden nervous feeling, practically sweating oceans.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The pain in my shoulder increases as well, to the point where I'm almost unable to walk straight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She doesn't seem to notice, instead ushering me to the house.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Gosh, if her parents see me sweating and gouted like a drug addict that's certainly the end of my career as a boyfriend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nonetheless I place my hand on the doorknob-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then suddenly the whole thing starts shaking violently!

Any second now I'll be gone, killed by some redneck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Certain that I will die I look at my girlfriend, taking in her form one last time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If only she knew how much she means to me, if only I could tell her...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't want to go...!

The only thing that remains is the pain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once I manage to orient myself and coax the room into stopping with the fucking spinning, I find out that I've fallen asleep on my injured arm, crushing it under my body.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Raptor Jesus, this is fucking painful.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to move, but it's easier said than done. I feel like I've been beaten to half to death...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No, entirely to death.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fucking hell, how long have I been laying like that? My entire arm is asleep.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a few seconds I'm afraid that I've lost so much blood that I've fucked up the circulation somehow, but slowly, very slowly I'm starting to feel pins and needles.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The pain in my shoulder increases tenfold, making me wish that I actually died for real.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The buzz that I didn't even notice was gone returns momentarily, its shrill sound cheerfully reminding me that physical pain isn't even the worst of it, the headache is where it's really at.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to locate the source, only to find my phone on the other side of the tub that I'm apparently sitting in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuck?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try reaching it with my feet, but I can't quite make it, the stupid device has wedged itself on the other side of the plug. The fact that I can barely coordinate my movement might also have something to do with it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thankfully the noise stops on its own.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With great relief I slump back into my impromptu seat, muttering a thankful prayer to some nondescript higher power for not yet killing me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After a minute or so I try again, stretching myself to the absolute limit. This time I manage to fling it towards me, and soon I'm able to grab it with my hand. Then I realize I could have just laid down flat and reach it without any issues.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Whatever. I'm content with just existing for now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Could do with a less painful existence though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I check on my phone, hissing and squinting my eyes as it lights up. Slowly I make sense of the jumbled sea of letters, in the end having to close one eye.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's around ten AM. There are a couple of missed calls from Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Instinctively I'm hit by a feeling of dread which surprises me, and I figure that it's time to make sense of my situation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Okay, I'm hangover and in the tub. I guess I wanted me to be close to water when I get up...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No! I'm certain that I reasoned that I will need a shower. Was I going somewhere? Is Stella calling me cause I'm sleeping through a date?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I cautiously check the screen again - no messages.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to straighten my back a little, which only causes pain to once again shoot through my shoulder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">God, this hurts so bad!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I double over, grabbing my aching parts tightly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Mids the agony of course the damn phone starts ringing again, thankfully in my hand instead of on the metal sheet this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Seeing Stella's face plastered on the screen allows my brain to connect the dots, finally pushing me over the edge. At first I only remember that Stella was the one to claw me, then the how and the why as well, then all that followed, and at last, all that happened previously.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The weight of my fuckup settles over my soul with renewed vigor. My chest tightens, but now at least I'm motivated enough to answer her call.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wait a handful of seconds for the pain to subside, but not for long enough that she'd end the call.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can barely produce the word, my throat dry like parchment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She doesn't answer immediately, probably too surprised that I've even picked up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Can you meet?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I sit up with a groan, fumbling around with my injured side.

What's up?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We need to talk."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ugh...

No way she isn't calling me to just break up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She doesn't answer for so long that I have to check if she's dropped the call already, nearly missing her next words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...Yeah."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, what do you know? Maybe it's not over afterall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Meet me at the park in an hour, okay? The one next to the school?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh-huh, I know where that is."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright, bye."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She doesn't wait for my reply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the one hour Stella has given me I can just barely scrape myself together. A shower is out of the question, so I just chug a liter of water in one go, then rush to the nearest bus stop. With today being a Sunday, I'll probably be at least twenty minutes late. Fucking bus schedule.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I consider calling a cab, but vomiting in one probably isn't cheap. Also, they don't usually pick up people from Skin Row.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a while I think about what Stella might plan to say, but more importantly what I should say - other than an apology or two.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Funnily enough, every time I get to something decently coherent, images from my dream flood my mind. I don't even remember most of it, only that I was like, on a date with Stella or something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or was it Fang?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">However hard I try, I can't pinpoint which girl it might have been. Only a vague female shape.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What I'm sure of is that I felt pretty happy. Comparing my current mood to it would be night and day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At least the heat is gone. The overcast sky and heavy wind have done their magic.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eventually my ride arrives and I need to halt my thought process in favor of concentrating on not dying.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">An excruciating half hour later we roll in at the stop I use on schooldays and I can finally disembark from this chariot of pain. By now my gut has twisted up into a tight knot, the feeling of impending doom looming heavily over me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The park is just on the other side of the school building.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I quickly check on my phone. I'm fairly certain that I didn't feel it buzzing in my pocket, but it's not like I'm a hundred percent lucid anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There it is, a missed call. It's probably Stella being impatient.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait, no... It's from Fang. I've missed it only by a few seconds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh god, not now...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hit up messaging to tell her to back off, but as I do I'm greeted by the dancing ellipsis, signaling that she's currently typing a message.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuuuck, there's no way this is gonna be any good. Why now?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Whhhyyyyy?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm having a slight mental breakdown over here, noticing that my breathing is picking up fast, same as my heartbeat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She stops writing, probably catching onto the fact that I'm online.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A second or so later she continues, seeing that I'm not writing anything. In my present state of mind though, even these seconds feel like hours.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The better half of a minute passes, then I'm greeted by a wall of text.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You okay?

Did they fight again? Did Fang tell her about the kiss or that I nearly had to go to the fucking hospital?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So many questions and possibilities flood my hangover mind that I almost blackout on the spot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I stumble to the nearest bench, supporting myself on it before I could collapse.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I close my eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Breathe.

Science? Maybe it was PE.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not yet dating, barely associating as is. We've maybe talked a few times in detention and in music class, all courtesy of Naomi of course.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, I've found that of all the pastel-colored dinos here, Fang was the most tolerable, when she wasn't going on about that enbie business. I guess she felt the same way about me and my cavemen kin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As such, we started talking on our own, sharing bits and pieces of each day together.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It must have been only a few weeks since my transfer, and my plan to remain invisible was going mostly okay.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'd talk with Fang and her crew, Reed and Trish, and with the girls that led the gardening club - what with being in detention so much for using the school bandwith to torrent all my stuff - but really that was it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wanna come over to my place?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I clearly remember freaking out at her question.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Never in the history of anything has a girl asked me over. I've had absolutely no grasp on the situation, very nearly declining out of sheer fear.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But then I figured... Yeah, why not?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I kinda enjoyed her company, so what was the worst that could happen?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't consider the possibility that she'd want anything romantic to do with me, more like she was bored of school and didn't want to be alone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As it happened, her parents weren't home at the time, allowing us for a more... Intimate afternoon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We didn't kiss or anything like that, but it was my first time alone with a girl nonetheless. She showed me her guitars and stuff, we ate some munchies, and shared a couple more cigarettes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I remember how flustered I used to be about indirectly kissing through the cigarette butts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Those were the times, so much simpler.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the following weeks we'd meet more and more, sometimes at her place and sometimes at mine. Other times we'd go see a show.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We've never officially announced these occasions as dates, and only rarely would we even hold hands.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But there was something, some unspoken force of attraction that we both knew was there.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe for Stella I was only a bunch of filled checkboxes, the right man in the right place, but with Fang... Back then it really felt like we were meant to be.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We didn't want to see one another for the prospect of a quickie in the sheets or a hefty makeout-session, it was more like... We saw eachother because it felt right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There were things we knew nobody else could - or would - understand, and yet it was so natural to share with the other.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At least the happy and mundane things were.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I never did tell her why I transferred, or why I wanted to be left on my own at times.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I never wanted to meet her parents or try with Naser. ...Or Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I never wanted to commit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I did enjoy my time with her, truly I have, but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After so many years of only relying on myself, I couldn't open up. I didn't even consider if we should get closer to eachother, it simply felt so comfortable to have a friend, a girl friend, that I could turn to when I wanted to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Only now do I realize how much I took Fang for granted, and that I've never really put any effort into building the relationship towards anything...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">How much did I hurt her by doing that, I wonder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She had to see me day to day, keeping up a smile, all the while knowing that the one person that might feel her equal still doesn't give a shit about her, not enough to go the distance anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe Stella was right, back then on the rooftop.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If I wanted to be with Fang then I would have fucking WANTED to be with Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But I didn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I check my phone one last time, turning it off afterwards. Wouldn't want my mom calling in the middle of the big emotional speech.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not that she would.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not that anyone from my family would.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As opposed to my fresh victims here in Volcaldera, they know better than to associate themselves with me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trying to clear my mind of all thoughts and emotions I slowly round the school building, eyes scanning the periphery for Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I finally spot her standing near another bench, holding an ice pack to her head and tapping with her feet impatiently. Her tail is swinging like a pendulum.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It doesn't take much to figure out that she's clearly frustrated. Talk about your hangovers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thankfully, Fang is nowhere to be seen. Maybe we can do this properly at least.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We can sort this out if it's just the two of us, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As soon as Stella sees me her eyes narrow, motioning at me angrily with the icepack. It reminds me of a certain other botanist dino and her shoe.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"YOU!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh fuck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You don't write, you don't call! I've been waiting for over half--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She cuts herself off with a loud yelp, probably noticing the bandaging on my neck. Dropping the tough girl routine along with the ice, she runs up to me and gets up on her tippy-toes, trying to peek under my shirt to assess the extent of the damage.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Gosh, Anon! Wha-- What happened? Did Fang do this?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stella... You did this."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to omit any and all blame from my voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't be angry at her for trying to stop me from making a mistake afterall. She could have been less rough about it, but eh, we were drunk.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella steps back, covering her mouth with both hands. Her expression is one of pure shock.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She seriously doesn't remember?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Christ, Anon, I'm so sorry!

The least I deserve is her cutting ties with me and moving on with her life. Maybe a slap for good measure.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon I..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Let's sit down, okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She grabs my hand tenderly, turning back to the bench.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even this simple motion confuses me greatly, and it takes considerable effort to put one foot in front of the other.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why is she doing this? If she wants to dump me then just go on with it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But why is she taking my hand then? She... She can't consider us still a couple, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not after the way I treated her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A feeling that I can't even describe spreads around my chest, making it hard to breathe and almost impossible to not cry like a baby.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's this simultaneous pang of hope, ever so fragile yet so strong, combined with the fatigue of knowing that I have to keep going. That the battle is not yet over. All shrouded within a fog of uncertainty.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All I know is that I don't want to be cynical and apathetic anymore.

Imagine if I had a blackeye right now, haha!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">God, her innocent naivete is only making it worse.

More secrecy with Fang? Fucking up another relationship and hurting the girl I care for the most? The one who's still willing to be with me?

She flinches a little, immediately searching for something else to look at. It proves to be her icepack, sitting in the grass where she dropped it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A little after that her lips stiffen, as if she consciously had to restrain herself from speaking. She probably doesn't want to make a hasty decision, or she's still looking for the right words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her grip on my hand tightens for a brief fraction of a second, but then she'd pull away if only I would let her. I can feel her muscles tensing up, but she allows me to keep touching her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her chest expands and deflates with heavy breaths, which I take as a sign that she has to put effort into appearing calm. I guess not everyone wears their emotions on their sleeves like I do - at least when it's not about cheating.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I really do wonder what's going on inside her head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She couldn't very well blame me for having feelings for Fang, given that Stella was the one to butt her head into the relationship to begin with. It doesn't stop me from feeling like a piece of shit about it, I just... I don't know, it feels different in her case.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What she could do is to blame herself for not being "good enough" to make me forget about Fang, but that's just retarded.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then there's always the chance that she would worry about me turning her into Fang 2.0 in my head, trying to fill a space with the next best thing. Which, well, I hope I'm not.

And s-stuff...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her brows furrow and she jerks her hand away from me, getting up from the bench in an instant.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why is it ME, that needs to calm down? Why AM I the one that needs to talk to someone?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All the pent up rage she's been suppressing is let out at once, her voice just below shouting-level.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But YOU! You can cheat, you can lie, you can throw me out and expect a date the next day, and I should still let you go see that bitch?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stella, I only want--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You want what?! Me to suck your cock until you're bored with me, then go straight back to that stupid fucking-- Ahh!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She lets out a weary sigh directed towards the heavens, reaching to her back pocket.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh fuck, am I getting shot?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Instead of a gun, she pulls out a well worn-out deck of tarot cards.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You know what I did while waiting for you? I did a reading."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And then another, and I shit you not, three more. You know why?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I kept getting arcana that suggest we should break up now, and I..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What?! She can't seriously base that decision on fucking tarot cards.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I didn't want to accept that. All these fucking shits, and I didn't want to believe them..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She throws a handful of cards at me, their intricate images dancing before my eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then she--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I refuse to believe what I'm seeing as she starts tearing up the remaining cards, directing her anger towards them. I'm way too stunned to try and stop her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With each card she destroys her shoulders shake, looking like she wants to cry but just can't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It breaks my heart to see her like this, but not as much as her next line.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...Because I wanted to believe in YOU!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She gets to the last card right as her outburst ends, tearing it in half with one swift motion and throwing the pieces in my lap.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With her stamina spent her body nearly collapses, fragile like reeds in the wind. I've never seen her this vulnerable, not even after her fight with Rosa.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm unable to form any response, left sitting on the bench dumbstruck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...But I can't..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...You're just like all the rest..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She practically whispers that last part, more to herself than to me. Still, her words hit me square in the chest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I expect her to run away, but it seems like she doesn't have enough strength to even do that. She's cradling her arms together, looking down at the ground and watching the wind pick up the cards by her feet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I reach out for her, slowly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Stella, I..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hearing my voice causes her to flinch again, looking up at me with reddened eyes - yet she still can't produce a single tear.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Now that I've got her attention, I just have to figure out what to say.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I want to tell her that I'm sorry, that it's gonna be okay because I won't stop until it is.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That I might have been a dipshit liar till now, but for her I can change, that I AM changing. I'm not like the others that dumped her after a bout of merry fun, cause I don't even know what I'd do without her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That I want to her to be all that matters in the world, my infallible reason.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That I love her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I've never wanted any of this, but--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't finish my sentence, her palm connecting to my face in one forceful motion. The slap disorients me, sending my head hurdling to the side.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fuck you, Anon!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This time, once the ringing in my ears stops I can hear the footsteps as she runs away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I realize that my choice of words probably wasn't the best, making her not hearing me out cruelly unfair, a mistake that I should hastily correct.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And yet...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sitting here covered with pieces of cards, pieces of Stella's life that she once held so dear... I can't...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If it wasn't for me, she could be her happy girly self. The weird occult weeb stego.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But now that I've intervened, now that I tried to be part of her life it's all ruined.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't help but remember the first time she invited me to her dorm room and her bed, right before that fateful kiss, how excited she was for her shitty anime. Her legs running a treadmill through the air, her inane ramblings about whatever character she liked, her shrieking into that huge plushie once the episode was over.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Now that will turn into her sitting by a desk in a tired stupor, scrolling whatever forums to find the best illogical critique to all the newest series before they even air, shitting on them to make herself feel better. Her passion gone, and not ever would she share an interest with anyone, fearing that they'd hurt her for it. Afterall, the one person who actually did care caused her the most hurt...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've successfully turned her into me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't deserve to love her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why do I have to just fuck up everything I touch? Couldn't I do something right for once?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Some unknown force compels me to reach for the last card Stella tore up, as if I could find the answers there.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even with my limited amount of knowledge about tarot - all thanks to Stella, naturally - I recognize the card as The Lovers. Of course.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I give a dry chuckle, throwing the pieces of paper to the ground among the rest. I entertain the thought that if Stella decided to look at it instead of splitting it in half, then we'd still be together, however I know that it's wishful thinking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No, I alone caused this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[???]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sup, loser?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A familiar voice comes from behind the bench.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, she just had to show up. It wouldn't have been complete otherwise.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Leave me alone."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to sound menacing, but end up simply sounding tired.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang rounds the bench kicking up a few cards, amused.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She didn't take it well, then?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her careless tone stirs something inside me, fists clenching.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She sits beside me in a relaxed pose, running her arm behind me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Leave me alone."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I repeat in a whisper, though this time with a low growl.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What was that? ...Well anyway, imma ditch the rest, wanna get out of here? Do you have any beer left?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I cannot fathom how she can be this nonchalant, seeing me in this state. Does she think after that kiss I'm all hers again?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That I didn't just have a painful breakup?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She elbows me in the side playfully.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"C'mon dweeb, we could--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Leave me. The FUCK. ALONE!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shout at her, grabbing her by wings much the same as Stella did, throwing her off of the bench. I stand up with her, my body shaking with fury. All the cards that were resting upon my legs fall to the ground, not that I care in the least.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It wasn't me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't fuck up. Not this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I KNEW that Fang coming over was no good. Homework bull-fucking-shit, it was never about that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She had to know Stella was at my place cause of her detention. Hell, Fang herself confessed that they couldn't do the gardening yesterday with the girls being busy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">SHE was the one who stirred the pot. SHE was the one who couldn't let me go. SHE had to bring up Stella's past.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She never cared if I found my happiness, not if it wasn't with her. And she clearly never cared about Stella, whom I just happen to care for. A lot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Never once in my life have I raised a fist at a woman - let alone anyone -, but I'm seriously considering it now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Seems like Fang finally got the message, standing perfectly still before me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Good. I don't want to listen to another word coming out of her mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"GO!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She stares back at me, first in defiance, though slowly her expression changes to pain and desperation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, p-please, don't do this..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I've only wanted what's best for you, that slut isn't--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Call her a slut again I FUCKING DARE YOU!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My voice rumbles in a way that I didn't know was possible. Like thunder. Fang is taken aback as well.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As if directed by some higher force, the clouds above chose this exact moment to let go of their burden, a heavy storm covering the area in mere seconds. I can hear the students whining and screaming over by the garden, running for shelter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The two of us stay standing however, the raging of the elements little bother compared to the battle of emotions. Our clothes get drenched fast, and I can feel the bandages on my shoulder loosen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang is the first to speak, shouting over the wind and rain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm the only one that ever cared for your sorry ass!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I let you do whatever you wanted, I let you handle me like an accessory, and only asked that you love me in return!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Was that so much to ask? Do I not deserve happiness?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm not going to let that SLUT take you away!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her deliberate use of the word angers me greatly, but what she says is...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I know that I wasn't a good partner to her. Yet there's no excuse for what she's done.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sorry that I couldn't be there for you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sorry that I couldn't love you!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But I can't!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And I never will!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Whereas Stella's slap was more ladylike, Fang decks me straight in the jaw. I take the punch with as much dignity as I can, but still stumble backwards.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wasn't at all prepared for the next one though, and not for the one after that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang lays a series of blows over my face and chest, even after I fall to my knees. A few of them hit my injured shoulder as well, each time painting my vision darker.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Right as I feel the last fragments of my strength slip away she stops, though I barely register it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's shouting. Fang and someone else. No, two others.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[???]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fang, stop! What the hell are you doing?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Get away from me! LET GO OF ME!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[???]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Somebody help him! Rápido!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I-is that Rosa? And Reed?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to raise my head, just now noticing that I'm not even on my knees anymore but laying flat in the mud.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All I can make out is a bunch of dino legs making their way towards us, then it all goes black.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Getting beat up fucking sucks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I awake in an unfamiliar room, which at first I assume to be inside a hospital - from the bed alone that I'm currently occupying. On second glance, however, I figure that it must be the school nurse's office.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The room is quite small, maybe two meters across, three or four meters wide. Besides the bed there's a desk by the door, several cabinets, and medical supplies all around. The usual posters as well, cautioning me to eat five times a day and not to forget exercise. All of them show dinos doing various activities, which is an odd disconnect from my old school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It reminds me how far I've come since then, which in turn then reminds me that my circumstances might have changed, but I'm still the same dipshit I've always been.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The nurse isn't here, but the bandages on my shoulder have been redone in a more professional manner, and I have brand new casts over my right eye and burst lower lip. I can also feel several bruises all over my face, chest, and shoulders.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">God, I feel like a fucking mess. In both body and spirit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Makes me wonder where everyone else could be. What happened to Fang? I hope she wasn't arrested or anything like that. I can still hear the rain outside, so it couldn't have been that long ago.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I reach for my phone, only to note that I've been undressed and put into a hospital gown kinda deal. Looking around I spot my stuff on a nearby shelf, clothes neatly folded, my wallet, keys, and phone lined up on top of them. Reaching them is out of the question, and I'm not yet ready to stand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just as I'd resign myself to spending the rest of the day here alone, commotion by the door hits my ear. Several muffled voices, only one of which I can make out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh. Fuck. Me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try sitting up as the doorknob turns, the massive body of Spears filling my vision.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He looks angry and disappointed, yet strangely calm.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"G-good afternoon, sir."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He doesn't bother to close the door, barely managing to squeeze through to me at all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How are you feeling?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm shocked that his inital motion isn't to shout my head off, fubmling to collect my words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Um, I... Okay, I guess?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He nods, inspecting my shoulder and bandaged eye in some detail.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You can thank your friend, Reed, for that. If he didn't intervene, you'd probably be in the hospital right now."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Is he okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"He's fine. Fang did give him a blackeye as well, but nothing serious."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm not really sure what to say to that. Soon I won't even be able to count the times Reed put his ass on the line for me, especially considering that I've never even deserved it in the first place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm very dissappointed in you, Anon."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm aware that as the principal he's supposed to say this even if he doesn't care, but it hurts to hear it anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Especially since I think he does care. He did come in to see me on a Sunday afterall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...Lots of that going around..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Letting my comment slide, he starts a little speech of his own.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Look Anon, the last thing I want is to dip into your relationship problems. But I do have to pay special attention to special students."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I will not tell you whether what you did was right or wrong. You're a good kid, just inexperienced."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But as a man you should have a code of your own, one that you can live up to. You cannot let your emotions flick you from one camp to the other."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Here, at school, we can help you grow, but it's up to you to chose where you take your future."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But if you keep this up, well..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even though he lets that last sentence hang in the air, I think I get the gist of it. They would want me to have a future that's worth living in. One that's filled with hope, and not with regret. I should be looking forward, and not dwell on all the mistakes I've made.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What will happen to Fang?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Spears sighs at my question, rubbing the bridge of his nose. Possibly because it sounds like I totally didn't listen to his advice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He drops his fatherly act, returning to his usual grim demeanor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She will be sent to psychiatric evaluation, like she should. If it was up to me she'd go straight to juvie, but I'm willing to bet her father will pull strings there."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A frown overtakes Spears's featues as he mentions Fang's dad, which strikes me as odd. I've never expected the two of them to have any kind of rivalry, but I guess it makes some sense. They're both prominent members of the community, and of very different backgrounds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I see."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well... That's still better than being arrested.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And Stella?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He shrugs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"The way I'm told she left the schoolgrounds long before your fight with Fang. Why do you ask?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Makes me wonder who told him that, cause "about five minutes" doesn't constitute as "long" in my book.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As to why I ask, well... I'm not even sure why, it might be the tiredness or that someone is finally willing to listen to me, but I decide to confess everything to Spears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We broke up just before I talked with Fang, and... It was pretty bad, like... I wish I could take it all back, cause..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I think I love her."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That last part seems to amuse Spears, a weird lopsided smile dawning on his ape-like face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Spears]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, I think she knows, son."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With another chuckle Spears leaves the room, squeezing past the furniture as he did on his way in. As soon as his suited body moves from the way I see none other than Stella standing in the hallway, half-hiding behind the open door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The moment our eyes meet my heartbeat picks up and my chest tightens, making it hard to breathe. My throat dries up in an instant as well.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Though that is nothing compared to the sudden burst of emotions that flood my mind, threatening to push me back to the warm embrace of unconsciousness.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't even begin to describe the joy that I'm feeling for seeing Stella here, a clear indicator that she still cares for me. Although it's tainted by the quite recent memory of how we parted.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She steps into the room and, unlike Spears, closes the door behind her. For a second I contemplate if Spears left it open so that Stella could listen in on our conversation, but I dismiss the notion.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She looks nothing short of a distaster much like me, with the exception of the bandages of course. Her clothes are drenched, wet hair all over the place, eyes red and puffy, distinct streaks of tears on her face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like before, her expression is unsure, cautios.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She slowly makes her way to the bed, gasping when she sees my condition from up close. Without a word her slender fingers explore the various injuries.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the end one of her hands remain on my chest, feeling my heartbeat. She bites her lower lip, though clearly with worry and not with arousal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to force a smile on her behalf, not that it really works out with my wounded lip.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I didn't think you'd come."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course I came! As soon as Rosa told me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I tried calling you like, a million times."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, sorry, I turned my phone off before um... You know..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It warms my heart to hear how much she cares, hope reigniting somewhere deep in my soul. Could we still salvage the situation?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She takes a deep, rugged breath, her attention once again turning to my bandages.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Gosh Anon, what happened to you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Didn't you hear?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well I've heard that Fang beat you up pretty bad, but... Why?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I thought that, you know... With me gone, you and Fang would..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shake my head, hissing as my damaged eye spikes with pain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nah, I told her to fuck off."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"R-really...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I nod, this time with a lot more caution, attempting another smile.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Really-really. I've finally figured out that..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, it doesn't matter. She was a dick to you, and I didn't want her around anymore. That's basically it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella doesn't respond, not for a while. Her hand on my chest moves to my shoulder, where she idle-mindedly - but carefully - starts to play around with the gauze.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's not looking me in the eye either, which fills me with worry.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And what about me? Do you want me around?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I very nearly blurt out "fuck yes I do", only held back as I realize how much I've hurt her already, and how much I could hurt her in the future. Should my longing for companionship outweigh the harm I could - and probably will - do?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I close my eyes, considering the situation. If us getting together means nothing but good times from here on out, I would hands down spend the rest of my life with her. Although, I've already thought that we were pretty good together, that nothing could ever go wrong.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...Not THIS wrong anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Would it be better to stay away from her? For her own sake? Even after all I've gone through to try and keep her by my side?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Remember what you told me, back on the beach?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I open my eyes again, looking at her and making her look back at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That we're weird enough already, and that we should try to be normal?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"At the time I thought it was pretty stupid, cause I was happy being with you, and everyone else could go suck a dick for all I cared."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So... I can't promise that I won't hurt you again cause I'm not only weird, but a big fuckdumb idiot too."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"All I know is that I wanna be better, and I want us to be together. And not, like, because you give the best blowjobs or whatever..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Besides, I did get you off twice, and you only did me once, so..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to laugh it up at the end, lightening the mood. She raises an eyebrow at that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Twice? Sure you're not thinking of another girl?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm a bit guffawed that she decides to elaborate on THAT part of my confession, but I guess we're not weirdos for nothing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nah. Second time was yesterday or like, the day before."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No, Anon, that was the first time."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uhhh, no? First time was us sexting. I even have the pic you sent, after like, a million years of me asking for it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She crosses her arms amused, giggling already.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon I... I'm not sure how to tell you this, but it took so long cause I had to pee, so um... I just licked my fingers and sent you a picture of that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well damn, there goes my ego.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Really? Cause I totally jerked off to that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her annoyance dissipates entirely, making way for the wide girly smile I'm more used to seeing on her face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"HA! So how was that two-to-one? Sounds like we're even to me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah-yeah, just you wait."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She laughs again as I try to defend the remaining shreds of my honor. With the mood successfully lightened I grab her hand, sitting up in the bed - as much as I can.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But seriously, I want us to stay together, if you'll still have me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her only answer is another smile and a nod, sealing the deal with a kiss. We carefully, awkwardly work around the cast on my lip, letting the kiss stretch on for a good minute or so. Her wet strands of hair stick to my face, but I don't care.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">However hard we try though, there's no real room here to actually make out. Stella lets out a frustrated whine at that, but ultimately backs off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just in time too, there's someone knocking on the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, that's probably Rosa. Do you mind if...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Just make sure she doesn't kill me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She rolls her eyes at my joke, flicking my forehead with a finger. Although we both know that I'm only half-joking. Rosa can be... Enthusiastic, to say the least.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come in!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To both of our surprise, the one coming through the door isn't Rosa but Reed, and holy shit, Spears wasn't kidding about the blackeye.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed's got an eyepatch larger than mine, still, the outlines of his bruise can be clearly seen even from this distance. Did Fang claw his eye out or something?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He steps next to the opened door, glancing at Stella expectantly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She looks back at me, hesitant, to which I only nod. Of all the people in the world, I probably have the least to fear from Reed. He's gone above and beyond covering for my ass, proving his unending loyalty - not that I deserve it in the least.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It'll be okay."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to sound as confident as I can, tightening my hold on Stella's hand before motioning for her to leave us. I can tell that she doesn't like this one bit, but complies nonetheless.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once Stella closes the door Reed walks up to me, taking in the sight of my many injuries like the others before him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reed]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...Hey. You okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I expect him to shrug it off with a laugh and offhand remark that it's nothing a few bowls of pot can't fix. Instead, he stays uncharacteristically serious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reed]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No, Anon, I'm pretty far from okay."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reed]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I had to fight Fang, you know."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't help but chuckle, having firsthand experience of just how strong she is.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She's kinda brutal, huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed hisses in clear annoyance, the look in his eye sharpening.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reed]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That's not my point, Anon. Fang is my friend."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reed]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's the second time now I've had to hurt her for your sake, and what do I have to show for it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reed]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why did I ever decide to help YOU?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've never expected it would hurt so bad to hear him say it. I know he's right, I've been having the exact same thoughts afterall...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't look into his eye any longer, meekly turning my attention to the now wet bedsheets - courtesy of Stella. It seems to only anger Reed, his hands curling up into fists, tight muscles dancing along his arms.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still he keeps his composure, his tone remaining calm.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reed]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't you have anything to say?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reed]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No 'Thank you Reed'? No 'Sorry that I'm a huge retard'?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I desperately want to say both of those things, but I'd feel like a phony if I did now. Does it even matter? We both know that I can't say anything that would make it right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...Thank you Reed, and I'm sorry that I'm a huge retard..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I practically mutter the whole thing, unable to actually look at Reed. His body tenses up and I expect him to hit me any second now, finishing what Fang started.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He surprises me once again, letting go of his anger with a deep sigh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reed]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Whatever, man..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Turning his back to me, Reed barks a short farewell in my direction.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Reed]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I swear to god Anon, if you fuck up the thing I got with Rosa, I will personally dig the grave for Fang to put you in."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">His threat catches me off guard, though I can't say it's unbiased. Without waiting for my answer he storms away, leaving me with my thoughts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't really know how I expected our reunion to turn out, but definitely not like this. Was I too naive to believe we could bury the hatchet and be buddies again?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Apparently so...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella returns to the room, her eyes looking for signs of our fight. Not that there would be any, Reed is far too responsible for that. There would have been a fight to leave any trace to begin with.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her expression is one of astonishment, seemingly unable to believe that I didn't get further mauled by the pink raptor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even though I totally would have deserved that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Longing for her touch I reach my arm out to her, feeling a lot better as our fingers meet. Hope I can get rid of this damn bandage soon and we can kiss properly. Well, I hope I can get out of this bed even sooner.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Especially so that I can go home. Spending the day with Stella might be nice too, but I just want something normal, something familiar in my life. Something old-fashioned.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A good ol' round of shitposting should do the trick.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Vidya too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even with how bad things got, I truly believe that I can have a normal life again - normal for me anyway. And it's because I have a partner that I can count on to be a weirdo with me, nonetheless a partner to help me be less of one. One I can finally trust.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella. My weird occult-shit-loving tarot-card-reading astrology-believer weeb stego gf.</div>
