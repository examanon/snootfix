                    <div class="fanfic-line">Reeda and Stella</div><div class="fanfic-line">Chapter 3 - Wrecked Mongolian Mosh Squad</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda and Stella could almost hear smooth jazz in the air as a mini-cooker sizzled from the open back of the astrovan.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The morning air was chill. After those cops rolled by it was hard to sleep.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella realized just how easy it was to wake up early when you didn’t have a house and saurs ticketed you for camping around for more than twenty-four hours at a time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And that’s if the neighborhood watch boomers and cops were generous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda casually mentioned the thieves as well. She wasn’t trying to brag or scare the sheltered stego. It was just something she dealt with, so the truth came out as it was.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She took solace in being able to let her mask slip like that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Is it okay if we talk about something else? You’re starting to bum me out,” Stella asked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Never mind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh. Yeah. So how’s your grandma? Are you cool living with her?” Reeda asked. She hid her disappointment by staring into the broiling concoction of a diced vegetarian gas station burrito and several eggs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She licked her maw needily, but leaned against Stella’s broad shoulder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“She’s okay… She’s demanding sometimes. She’s used to people working hard for her. She was head of the Geology Department at RexU</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her trepidation was apparent, and she stared off into the distance as if trying to avoid her own words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We’re lucky she didn’t walk in you riding my head like a bicycle seat.” Reeda cracked the lewd analogy at her own expense.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella’s beak clenched. Her cheeks pinkened.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Wheelchair,” she corrected.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Is that why there’s a single stair up to your room?” Reeda asked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella smirked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Devilish, bro!” Reeda hollered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella and Reeda continued their weekly flings for a while. They watched anime mainly on Stella’s recommendation, but after scoping some swap meets, Reeda snagged some factory sealed Mad House OVAs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They laughed their asses off at the Central Park Studio localizations; the VA work consisting of three chain-smoking Bostonians in a broom closet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But even with all this media -- all these high theatrics and hyberbolic, whacked out premises played straight, all this speculative fiction and smut and ultra-gore alike -- once their precious films ended they were left with a dark screen and empty reflections of themselves within.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They could spend hours talking about anything as long as it circumnavigated the concepts of these shows, but Stella found Reeda overbearing when it came to breaching her privacy. And likewise, Reeda found Stella inhibited and unwilling to open up about her own problems, or listen to her's.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Images of their last weekend still burned in their peripheries:</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why won’t you look at me right now? What are you thinking about? I-I’m losing patience, bro.” Reeda grunted.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I don’t want to talk about it, okay!? You think I want to live here? I can’t run off and have adventures like you do?” Stella shouted back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Is that what you think I do?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Just get on the bed.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey! Uncool. Unlock the door!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">THWUMP!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In her crammed room, Stella’s giant tail gave Reeda no chance to dodge. It was just like that dream all over again…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The weeb cried. She said it was an accident, that she was scared and didn’t want her to leave.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck, Reeda thought. Then why won’t you let me in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda winced as she brushed her abs. The welt was still as dark as the dirty background cels in Gundam Zeta.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Camille was definitely a girl’s name, but that dude fulfilled a Freudian loop in the first four episodes. He killed his mom (accident) and dad (through duel), which is more development than most real people get.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda then realized what she was thinking about.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella was rubbing off on her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She crunched the bead at the end of her menthol cigarette and purged her lungs with intoxicating mint smoke. She hid under the awning of the Forever 24/7 to evade a cloudless blast of piss yellow drenching the city in blazing sun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She didn’t feel up to band practice and her van was still out of gas… a block away from Stella’s apartment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Speak of the devil: the mint witch herself panted. Unused to running, her footsteps slapped the ground loudly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda nearly put her cig out and walked away right then and there, but boy did the stego’s hips bounce. It kept her distracted just long enough to meet the meek smile of her… friend? Girlfriend?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Somebody.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella floundered immediately under Reeda’s harsh scowl. She never saw creases that stretched across her smooth, dainty, bubblegum muzzle like that before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She found her legs trembling again. Her skin tightened under more than one kind of heat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She peeped nervously, pulled a shirt from her bag, and knelt before the pissy pink dino.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was a bootleg Devilman t-shirt. The art was traced via pen but there was still some nice hatching to it. The eyes were off center on the portrait shot, creating an image both funny and uncanny simultaneously.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda couldn’t help but smile.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m not good at staying mad,” she sighed, and accepted the shirt right away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’ll tell you everything, if you want. I didn’t mean to hit you.” Stella murmured.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah yeah. I know, no one can resist these guns~.” she cheered, and flexed her sizable biceps.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella cooed and glomped Reeda against the wall of the convenience store with a loud thump.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Their mouths met. Reeda cupped each of Stella’s buttocks and lifted her off the ground, angling her better to taste the mint nicotine off her tongue.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Their tails coiled around each other and swayed in unison until their combined strength (and Stella’s dangerous spines) smashed the side of a video rental kiosk.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That’s when they decided to run.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda changed into her new shirt at the park overlooking the harbor. There, she told Stella the only way to make it up to her was to get outside her comfort zone, and she wouldn’t take no for an answer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We’re gonna mosh at Patina’s Pub.” Reeda stated.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Are you sure? Those metalhead guys are huge. They’re really scary.” Stella asked wispily.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Nah. That’s just an appearance thing to filter out the softies. They’re pretty nice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Just don’t accept drinks from em’.” she added sharply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella didn’t know how small she was. The inner city burned into her with sights and sounds and scents: seven-way intersections designed by acidhead spiders, skyscrapers smeared with grime, the light cinnamon clouds off a churro vendor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If she didn’t take Reeda’s hand it’d suck her into its enormity like a vortex. Maybe she was an isekai character afterall, but a stranger in her own life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She couldn’t help but huddle against Reeda on one of the many bus lines. They did this partly to protect their bags, but Stella’s round nostrils flared to inhale Reeda’s sweat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She smelled like everything; the outside world the mysterious, downtrodden pink raptor had to face every day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The world that molded her whether she wanted it or not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A hand gently caressed her hair, riding the straight strands down to her neck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You doing alright down there? We’re almost there. I’ll take care of the sodas. Just don’t get boozed up. We’re here to battle, got it?” Reeda’s voice vibrated through her chest and into Stella’s ear.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It tickled.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yes. Thank you, Reeda.” Stella said, then clasped her hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Patina’s Pub bustled in the mid-afternoon, but it always seemed to bustle. Stella never saw anything like it before. It was obviously a historical landmark, a wooden, Victorian-styled building complete with sensual curves in its etchings and chair legs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The numerous hunting trophies, mainly head mounts of elk, vibrated from the constant harmonious screeching of a ptero band in the concert hall: a small back patio.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The colorful couple, Reeda dressed in tatters and her gifted tee and Stella her shorts and OPPAI shirt, swaggered boldly passed the sizable bouncers and inside, where a wall of noise electrified their very bones.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda led Stella through the front end of the pub, the bar section. The men and women there looked like background goons in any number of anime. These guys had to be thirty, but they dressed like messier versions of Fang, and they wore patches all over themselves. They looked like scarecrows from a children’s story.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Some of them cast glares at Reeda, who simply straightened her posture and ignored them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella felt the chill of tension from this exchange. She didn’t know Reeda used to brew their carfe with a chemist’s expertise unmatched by many, or that she had to stay at Trish’s house for over a month after they found her house.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That was when her parents disowned her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella didn’t know this. She would never know.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The moment passed, and the tension lifted as they entered a doorway like some Thelemic ritual. They stood in the eye of the storm now, where the shitty metal bands played loud enough to be loved by anyone, and directed rippling walls of flesh and denim to fill the cracks of the room and crash together.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella was overwhelmed. She backed away from the noise and pressed into any wall she could. This took a while given the thrashing crowd, but none of them shoved or body checked her. She seemed to permeate through them until reaching safety.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Meanwhile, a wild, pink mane bounced in the innermost eddying of violence. She was small, but threw herself into every passing body like a dancing star. Her face twisted into a demon’s smile, razor teeth clenched tight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But every body she displaced swelled back, sandwiching her between multiple guts until she gasped into the choking sound.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Because there was no air here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Only electricity, bitch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella squealed from secondhand pain as an ankylosaur the size of Fang’s dad bodyslammed Reeda so hard she splayed against the wall like a sticker, and tumbled to the floor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The man’s expression was soft, and he peeled the raptor back onto her feet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then, he bodyslammed her again in the very next swell.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The green stego’s eyes still flitted across the room like a startled doe, her hands folded to her chest to protect herself. However, it finally started to make sense. Almost like the playground rules of elementary school or a skatepark, there was an unspoken conduct.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It seemed fairly consistent, aside from the parasaurolophus plucking glass shards out of her face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It reminded her of Naomi, for some reason.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella found herself riding the current of the mosh, from the safe corners of the room into the choppier, more visceral waves.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She gently rode them back and forth, easing into the rush.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her soft, cute expression hardened as she neared the apex of this mosh. Her lips curled into a grin and eyes narrowed until knife-like creases formed against her round face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her hefty hip checks were enough to floor many a potential foe, and while she accepted the occasional challenge of a comeback tackle or a repeat slammer, her sights were set on Reeda:</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The chill, pink raptor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her only anime friend?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck pal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A peppy, spirited, intuitive sweetheart?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A bitter power-bottom with a lascivious appetite.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s spirit glowed, but her body was raw and loose. The pain buzzing from her nerves were deadened by pure adrenaline. It was easy to tell she was working off years of anger after she performed a flying clothesline powerful enough to floor that ankylo.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They both laughed, and then she strained to help him up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then their eyes met: Reeda and Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Neither of them smiled as they picked up speed toward each other. Stella wore a confident grin while Reeda, battle hardened, only plunged toward her as a hunter with a spearlike snout.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They didn’t have time to marvel at the pack intuition of the room: how the flailing limbs seemed to arc away from them or part just to give them space, or how the down-tuned dual guitars of the band screeched into a crescendo along with the vocalists’ voice:</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Whadd you mean my SSR-ID’s gone? The water bill’s come and I don’t gotta paper presence!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’ll show you to whack me you weeb bitch! Hot-and-cold brat! Homely, spoiled cunt!” Reeda roared.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You crusty punk! Bitter, aloof shit! You belong under my ass, butt slut!” Stella screamed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Everything that was Reeda and Stella -- a pair of blurs, pink and green -- threw themselves through the air at full speed. Their impact reverberated through the concert hall with a loud CRACK!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even the drummer groaned at the result.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hahaha. Raptor Jesus Christ, dude,” someone chuckled drunkenly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Who let these fucking kids in here?” a hiss of a whisper called out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Call their fucking parents or something,” another hiss.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda and Stella huddled in the corner of a piss soaked, sticker coated bathroom. They cried openly, but no one could blame them. It’d been a long time since anyone saw a snoot-on-snoot collision of that magnitude.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“This is why you have to be careful. You’re lucky some of us have med skills.” The large ankylosaur from earlier spoke calmly. His expert hands wrapped the mangled, bulbous ends of their snouts in bandages. They were already soaking with blood from the plump tomatoes at the ends of their snouts: the impact site.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I got no idea how it didn’t turn out worse. We’d get closed down if some kids like you went to the hospital.” he said more sternly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thick beams of bendy plastic slid around both sides of the length of their snouts. They were children’s medical equipment: purple and covered with stickers of twee saurs eating leaves. He wrapped them along with small cages at the end of their snouts to protect the injury sites.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It’d be impossible to hide these snoot splints from their friends, and any pressure on even a human’s nose cartilage was enough to force one to tears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was much, much worse for the dino women.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser enjoyed a quiet afternoon on the cafeteria patio, slowly conquering his calc assignments under a pink sunset at Volcano High with his even pinker girlfriend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then, he got a call. There was shrill, hysterical screaming on the other end. It was Fang. Naser’s eyes’ narrowed, revealing bags that made him look a decade older than reality.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He argued with Fang, then with Naomi until he got into the NasCar to drive to some less-than-colorful joint downtown.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Are they alright?” he asked, not knowing if he’d get an answer or another verbal lashing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah.” Fang huffs. She threw her long, silvery bangs to the side. “Just… when the hell did Reeda and Stella party together? I didn’t know Stella did anything.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“They better not be carfing it. If they stink, I’m not driving them. Dad’ll kill me if he thinks we’re doing drugs.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fuck off! Reeda quit that stuff.” She shot back, defending her friend and her own faith in her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">By the time they arrived, several disgruntled punks and metalheads delivered the bent-snouted women to the car, then promptly told them to fuck off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser obliged, terrified at the very sight of them getting near his car.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He didn’t have to ask why Fang’s friends looked like Bane. One good thing about having a sis- sibling like Fang is she can do all the talking for him:</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I can’t believe you stupid dweebs. You had to off-put all this shit on me to come pick you guys up!?” Fang barely tapped a fingernail onto Reeda’s tomato-snout. It was enough to paralyze her with pain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Auuugh! Maximally uncool!” the pink raptor whimpered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You ditched practice! We had to play acoustically today. What’s your excuse?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘I didn’t wanna go. I finally have my life back and I had some soul-searching to do. This involved watching dozens of hours of Japanese animation and getting sat on by a pear-bottomed sweetheart, who I also wanted to bodyslam through a brick wall.’</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It all made perfect sense in her head, but Fang already put the fear of pain in her, and she trembled out a faux chill, “I lost track of time. We were just… hanging out!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She tried to chuckle sweetly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even Naser scoffed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eyes then turned to Stella. She hadn’t made a peep this whole time and frankly, no one knew what she thought. She just stared into her bruised lap.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Stella? What happened?” Fang asked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“We had a fling for a while, but it’s over now. We worked everything out,” she said sweetly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang’s eyes opened wide enough to wrinkle her entire face. Her long, elegant snout fell into an open-mouthed gawk.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The green stego’s face was a cherub’s smile, but her lips curled into a devilish grin as Fang turned to Reeda, who’s eyes nearly rolled out of their sockets.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda stammered illegibly for several seconds as her face glowed. The proverbial spaghetti shot from her pockets and all over the car like confetti.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella's hand gently grasped Reeda’s.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She then whispered, loud enough for everyone to hear:</div><div class="fanfic-line">“This is why I get to be dom.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser struggled to contain his huffy excitement, and nearly blew a stoplight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang pinched both Stella and Reeda by the snoots as punishment for making her hear that.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“J-just drop them off on the next corner.” She sighed.</div>
