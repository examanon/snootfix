                    <div class="fanfic-line">Chapter 2: Carousel of Agony</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another day, another attempt of trying to go six hours without wanting to blow my brains out. After a relatively uneventful and long walk, I finally approach the school, not particularly bothered with how late I am.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's a particularly foggy day out, as the clouds enshroud the sky, giving a degree of eeriness commonly seen in shitty horror movies.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A thought occurred to me that stopped me in my tracks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Weird how I just noticed this now. I didn't see it when I… Wait…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why don't I remember leaving my apartment this morning?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">....</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Huh, weird...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I make my way closer and closer to the school, but a buzz emanates from my pocket, beckoning me to grab my phone and read the notifications.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A text from Fang?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"♫Control over my life you denied, and now death approaches from the sky. Why'd it be me you had to vilify? Goodbye Volcano High.♫"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the actual fuck?? Something is VERY wrong here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I approach the building's entrance with a feeling of uneasiness and dread. The closer I get to the door, the more I notice a disturbing lack of noise from the school. Sure, class has already started, but it's usually still louder than this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As my hands grip the door handles, every instinct in my body is telling me to turn back and run away as far as I can. At the same time, my mind is telling me to enter and investigate the building after receiving that cryptic text from Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well… No more turning back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I open the doors entering the school, my eyes close as my nose is instantly struck with the overwhelming metallic stench of wet ozone, the smell that everyone knows…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And when my eyes open, I am greeted by the sight of the school's hallway, a place I've made myself familiar with over the past couple of months, navigating through the daily slog…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My school's hallway, reduced to a mountain of corpses.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A sinking feeling grasps my heart in horror as my mind begins to process the image in front of me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Amidst the sea of red, the remains of countless of my classmates laid across the floor, the light devoid from their eyes like a doll. God no… This isn't real… This isn't real.. This isn't real…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No! NO!" A cry emerges from the hallway ahead of me before being cut off by a loud gunshot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The shot startled me enough to lose my balance and trip over one of the bodies, falling face first in the puddle of blood.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I emerge, trying to regain my breath while wiping away the blood off my face. As I can see more clearly, my eyes are caught by the body lying face down to my right, noticing the floral green jacket riddled with bullets and the wings of the corpse being misshapen… Oh no..</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't need to turn the body over to know it's him. I'm so sorry, there's nothing I can do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I returned my direction to the source of the scream. However, the bodies that lay in front of me became alarmingly familiar.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naomi, Rosa, Spears?!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No, no this isn't real, this is all just a horrible fucking nightmare, and I'm waking up right now, I just have to get out of here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to navigate through the bloodied corridor, treading carefully to avoid tripping or stepping on my former classmates.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">More and more of the victims become familiar. Reed, one of the few people here who was genuinely nice to me, lying motionless on his back with a bullet hole leaking between his eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Next to him is the body of his bandmate Trish, crumpled against the wall with a large gunshot in her upper chest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">None of this makes any sense.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why the fuck is this happening? I take a left to follow the source of the cry, and the first thing I notice is how immaculate the hallway looks, contrasting the bloodbath I just exited. No bodies laid scattered across the floor, save for one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My gaze spots the puddle of blood growing larger from the green stegosaurus that lay huddled against the lockers, her face stained in tears and her stomach in crimson.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*BANG* *BANG*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My observations are cut short as both of my legs crumple underneath, causing me to fall to my knees in excruciating agony, my ears ringing from both shots. The impact of the fall on my shins only intensified the pain…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"FUAAAA-" I attempt to muster a scream, the pain preventing me from opening my throat further. I can only hyperventilate as the searing white pain ravages my body.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hear a pair of footsteps become louder and louder, the sound of leather boats knocking against the hard floor. Fear and sorrow envelopes me further when the figure enters my vision and turns to face me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her wings are bloodied and scattered with bald spots, her arms tense as she grips the revolver in her right hand, the barrel still smoking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She remained still and stared me down, eyes full of hatred and malice, her body quivering with rage.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Millions of emotions go through my mind as my eyes meet the face of my attacker, shock, heartbreak, remorse. The feeling is almost indescribable.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"F-fang, please… I…" I attempt to weakly muster out, the agony making it difficult to speak coherently.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Shut up…" Fang snarls, rage visibly bubbling from her as she raises the pistol towards me. "You made me do this!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And you're gonna get what's coming to you..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">BANG</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The gunshot causes me to cry out in fear and shoot up, yet I am still alive.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Additionally, I find myself not surrounded by the bodies of my former classmates but rather in Rosa's living room, drenched in my own sweat on her couch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a moment to gather my bearings and pull the blankets off of me, revealing that only one of my legs is injured rather than both of them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fucking hell… I told them this is exactly why I try not to sleep. The dreams I've been having are only getting worse and worse.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sometimes I'm forced to relieve that day on repeat, watching everyone around me die horribly than the last. Other times, the ghosts that haunt me daily, extending their torment to my dreams too, forcing me to suffer their wrath again and again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well… I'm awake now at least, better get my ass out of bed and see where Stella and Rosa are.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a quick look around the room and spot the desk chair sitting by the coffee table to my right and beside it a pair of crutches leaning against the makeshift wheelchair.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Seated on the chair laid a note that simply said: "For Anon." I already have a pair of crutches at home. They don't have to give me another pair. I really don't deserve any of this…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Although I do need them to walk, I grab hold of both of the crutches, position one on each arm, and lift myself off the ground.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's awkward, but I manage to support myself with the crutches and put most of my weight on my non-crippled leg.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's a little bit since I last used crutches, so I take a few seconds to get a feel for them and make sure I know what I'm doing so I don't fall on my ass.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I put all of my weight on the makeshift legs and use my right leg to move forward, and shift the weight back to my foot while using the crutches to move forward until I gain a sense of rhythm. Using that formula, I make my way out of the living room and into the corridor of the Castillo household.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I make my way towards the kitchen, I examine some of the items that decorate the hallway, photos of Rosa and her family, artwork, religious memorabilia. Nothing too dissimilar to what was in her living room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But the table right of the hallway catches my eye and stops me in my tracks, a framed picture of a rather burly-looking older male ankylosaurus, auburn hair with white streaks, a rather bushy beard. He's smiling in the picture with warm eyes, and beside the frame laid two unlit candles and a cross hanging above the photo.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The realization hits me that the photo on the table is supposed to be a memorial to someone that the Castillo's lost as I notice the words at the bottom of the frame.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Se ha ido, pero nunca se ha olvidado.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">An epitaph.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Gone, but never forgotten.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Was he Rosa's father, her grandfather perhaps? Whoever he was, he must have been a very important man to Rosa and her family.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My eyes leave the memorial as I enter the kitchen. The first thing I catch is Stella sitting motionlessly at the kitchen table, still wearing the same anime-themed pajamas as last night, holding a warm cup with both hands as Fang aims a revolver towards her head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait, what?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fear enshrouds my heart.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No no no no no, am I still dreaming? Fang's not supposed to be here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All I can do is close my eyes and yell.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"NOOOOO!!!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My terrified scream causes Stella to jump in fear while letting out a scream of her own.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"EEEEEE!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"HEY! ¿QUÉ TE PASA, POR QUÉ GRITAS Y TE PONES ASÍ DE LOCO?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My eyes open to see Stella sitting at the table hyperventilating, her hands grasping a cup of coffee, with Fang nowhere to be seen…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And now my schizo-tiered outburst has sent the lime stegosaurus into a panic attack.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well?! What do you have to say for yourself An-on?!" I finally take notice of Rosa standing by the stove with a rubber spatula in hand, shooting me an angry glare.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I-I'm sorry, I thought I didn't recognize you guys for a second."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Dios mio… Are you sure it was just your leg that was broken, not your eyes too?" Rosa shoots a confused glare at my lie.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Setting the spatula down, she takes a seat at the table to comfort her distraught stego. Head buried in the table, her breathing slowing down as Rosa rubs her shoulder while reassuring her quietly in Spanish. Unlike Stella, Rosa is fully dressed in a crimson hoodie accompanied by a dark black pair of jeans, similar to her outfit from the day prior.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry for being retarded, I… had a pretty nasty dream last night." I apologize to the two and make peace. "Let's just say what I saw in the dream made me a little… jumpy this morning."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rosa continues her confused stare towards me. However, her demeanor softens as if a light switch went off in her head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh sí! I remember you said last night you often had bad dreams, no?" Her face lit up with sympathy as she recalled our previous conversation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah.. This one was pretty bad, I saw it happ-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Please… don't..." A muffled yet breathy voice emerges from the startled stego, face still buried in her arms</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My attention is directed towards Stella. Her breathing slows down, and her body relaxes as she looks up to me, face and eyes puffy. Stella's look is filled with a variety of different emotions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Discomfort.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fear.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sympathy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Pain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"P-please... don't talk about the dream." Her eyes fixated on mine as she requested.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The day Fang turned Volcano High into a shooting range deeply scarred Stella, whatever happened to her. It seems any mere mention or allusion to what happened that day seems to upset her. Recalling how careful Rosa is when speaking about her friend's mental health or how she would avoid directly happening, just referring to it as 'that day,' it would probably be a smart idea for me to do the same thing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They did a lot for me yesterday, even when I didn't deserve anything, the least I could do is not be a dick.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry, Stella… I won't." I directed my words towards the disturbed stego as I took a seat at the table, then glanced at both of them. "And I'm sorry for scaring you both, I-I didn't mean to."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella replies to my apology with a gentle nod. Rosa's expression eases as a slight smile appears across her face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Está Bien An-on, it happens." Rosa reassures me. "So, how is your leg feeling this morning, and how do the crutches help?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My leg?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, it still feels like it's about to fall apart at a moment's notice. But it's not as painful as it was yesterday, I suppose… I probably should be wearing a cast, but a doctor can only have so many medical supplies in her house…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, it's not the leg I'm worried about.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"A-Anon?" Stella's words snap me back to reality.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh? O-oh uhh, it still hurts a little bit, but I do feel a little bit better today." I attempt to answer their concerns with a half-truth, but they don't seem to be convinced by my summary.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then a brief silence follows as Rosa tries to analyze my words while Stella goes back to her drink.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So.. How did you guys sleep last night?" I ask both of them, trying to change the topic and break the silence.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To my surprise, Stella is the first one to answer my question as she sets her cup down and looks back at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I couldn't… sleep last night, so I just watched more episodes of this new anime I'm checking out called Vinland Saga." Stella's expression brightens, contrasting the frightened state she found herself moments prior. "It's a really cool show, and it's about Vikings and stuff!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Huh, I find it hard to wrap my head around Stella watching any anime that isn't magic girl or fujoshi shit, let alone one about Vikings. I guess a lot can happen in six months.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uhhh cool, Stella!" I manage to choke out, not really sure where to direct the conversation next. "How uh.. How far did you get?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ay Niños, as fun as this topic is for all of us, I'm afraid we have to leave very soon!" Rosa interjects after glancing at her phone, why does she need to leave so early?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"If I'm going to drop you and Stella home and make it in time for school, we have to leave now An-on!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why couldn't the part of my brain that causes me to mumble like a dumbass get broken rather than my leg?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ehh never mind about that, It completely slipped my mind that it was a Monday today and that Rosa is still going to Volcano High.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh r-right, I forgot about that. Busy day today, Rosa?" I ask as the focused ankylosaur begins gathering the books and notes that are scattered on the table.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sí! I have a test for my morning class, a student council meeting at lunch, and I also have to work with the gardening club after school!" Rosa explains, a hint of weariness gripping her voice, it can't be easy having that much responsibility.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not that I would know, obviously.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That sounds pretty productive…. How about you Stella, what are your plans?" I direct my question towards the somber stego, who I caught mid-sip of her drink.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella, caught off guard by the question, started to choke on her coffee and began coughing, with Rosa patting her back as she gave a slight chuckle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ohh uhh… I-I don't know yet…" She answered with uncertainty, her voice sounding hoarse after substituting coffee for oxygen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But it's not like I can't relate with that. I've got no fucking clue what I'm gonna do when I get home.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How about you An-on? What will you do?" Rosa questions me, seemingly reading my mind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Me? I'll uh… I…" I struggle to answer. Rosa makes it sound like she's asking for my plans for today, but I know full well that question has a broader meaning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What can I say other than what I've already been doing for the past five months? Just withering away in my apartment while I aimlessly scroll the internet and replay Rock Ring on repeat until my eyes bleed?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'I… I don't know yet."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"G-glad to see I'm not alone there." Stella uncharacteristically responds with a hint of sarcasm. I don't think I've ever seen her use sarcasm before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No importa, the day has only just begun. I'm sure you two will figure out what you want to do eventually!" Rosa chimes in as she rises from the table, clearly ready to depart. "But we have to leave now if we're going to make it on time!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay, I just need to put on some clothes first." Stella sheepishly asks as she exits the room, understandably since oversized weeb shirts and cat slippers typically don't make the best public outfit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait, this gives me an idea.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uhh, I just gotta use the bathroom first if that's cool?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Por supuesto An-on, just be as quick as you can!" Rosa excuses me, prompting me to rise from the table albeit awkwardly due to the crutches and hobble myself into the hallway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I probably should have asked where exactly the bathroom was since I didn't have to use it at all last night. I see two of the doors on each side of the makeshift memorial.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Taking a lucky guess, I open the door on the left only to see a closet, filled with a couple of coats, boots, and a plaque obscured by the various articles of clothing, only the name visible.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sebastián Castillo.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Gathering from what little I can see of the plaque, it looks like some kind of award, so why would something seemingly prestigious be hidden away in a closet?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">....</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I probably shouldn't even be looking in here…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I close the door as quietly as I can, not to let Rosa know that I am violating her family's privacy. I carefully step away from the closet and then make my way over to the door on the right, successfully locating the bathroom this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Compared to the rest of their house, the bathroom does seem rather plain. Rather than the colourful decorations and Latin memorabilia, the room is adorned with a mirror, soap, drawers, a sink, and of course, a toilet. The latter of which isn't why I went to the bathroom…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm a piece of shit for doing this...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Locking the bathroom door, I began to check the cabinets below the sink for any trace of pills, painkillers, Ambien, Adderall. Hell, I'll even take some random prescription meds as long as it makes me fall asleep.</div><div class="fanfic-line">But all I find is just some extra rolls of toilet paper and a bottle of wakinodex. Standard bathroom appliances…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The objects stare at me as if they're mocking me for not failing to find my treasured resource or how I'm raiding my friend's cabinet for a quick fix. I wonder if I'd be able to-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*KNOCK* *KNOCK*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Vamos An-on! We need to go now!" Rosa's voice bellows from the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Never mind…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uhhh sorry, coming!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I flush the toilet and run the sink to not arouse any further suspicion, and then unlock the door to see a particularly impatient ankylosaur, holding a backpack in one hand and a pair of car keys in the other.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ready now?" She asks before moving towards the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah sorry about that… Wait, where's Stella?" I ask as I shut the bathroom door and follow her throughout the hallway</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"¿Dónde crees? She's in the car waiting for us!" She turns around to face me with a scowl. The sudden hostility from Rosa catches me off guard, stopping me in my tracks while trying to keep myself standing with the crutches.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rosa's scornful look quickly evaporates and turns into one of remorse, as if she realized the words that just came out of her mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Lo… Lo Siento An-on, I've just been dealing with a lot right now… With school, work, life, figuring out what I want to do once I graduate."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And having to hang around two emotionally broken teenagers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I shouldn't have snapped at you like that. I'm sorry…." Rosa sighs as her body relaxes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rosa definitely seems a lot more patient than I remember. If I recall correctly, she threatened to kick my ass with the dreaded chancla after falling the school garden's flowers, or how I couldn't find Fa-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...After I couldn't do what she asked, and now she's been nothing but understanding to me, patient, kind, and to me of all people? Why?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Let's get going, sí?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thankfully I don't think I mumbled that out loud…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">About 15 minutes pass as we drive further into Volcadera Bluffs. Since Rosa lives on the outskirts of the city, the drive is a bit long but enjoyable. I've been continuing my earlier conversation with Stella about that new anime she's been watching. It's almost… refreshing to see her cheer up compared to the downtrodden state I've usually seen her in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And then he meets this really big Viking guy who was friends with his father, like he's really strong too, and there's this one part where he even uppercuts a horse!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even Rosa chimed into the conversation, which surprised me since I didn't take her as one who would partake in anime.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"There's no way he could beat Goku or Naruto!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Raptor Jesus… And I thought Stella had normie taste…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But still, it's just nice to be able to have a conversation with another living being, not just a loser behind a screen, and certainly not the dead. Is this what it feels like to have friends again?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even before coming to Volcadera Bluffs, I hadn't had a friend for a long time. After the incident, I came to the conclusion that friendship would once again be nothing but a distant memory to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But I'm still not sure what to make of this. Both of them did more than enough for me, especially Rosa. And I repaid her by trying to steal medicine from her family, some fucking 'friend' I am. A part of me just wanted to see this as a one-time thing. They only helped me out of pity. They didn't need leaving a former classmate to rot on the street hanging on their conscience.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But… Another part of me doesn't want to let go of that and believes that their intentions were genuine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As the roads slowly transition from rural to urban as we make our way into the heart of Volcadera Bluffs, and after few turns into converging neighbourhoods, Rosa pulls into a driveway which can mean we have arrived at Stella's house.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A clean three-story house of modern design, accompanied by a Hadro Civic sitting in the driveway and a well-maintained garden facing the house. Not unlike Rosa's house, a part of me forgot that Stella is also a skilled green thumb like her best friend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Thanks again Rosa, I appreciate you helping me out and having me over!" said the Lime Stego in a rather cheerful manner as she unbuckled her seatbelt and grabbed her bag, but not before turning back to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And it was great seeing you again Anon, I hope we can talk again sometime."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why would you want to talk to me, though?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah, me too. It was great seeing both of you again." I muster out to Stella</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Would it be okay if we exchanged numbers so we can talk?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The retarded half of me is saying 'lawl a girl is trying to get my number' whereas the realist part of me is trying to find a way to refuse so I can just wither away some more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, si! That's a great idea, An-on let's exchange numbers too so we can stay in touch!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess I don't have much choice in the matter, don't I? Ehhh, I suppose it's the least I could do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I comply and spell out my phone number both to them, prompting them to send me a text message to add them back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'Hola An-on, Rosa here!'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'Astrology reveals the will of the gods.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Two text messages that perfectly describe the two...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It was nice to see you again Stella, I hope you have a good one" I wave goodbye as she exits the car and enters her house, her body language slightly more cheery and positive than the morning I saw her as.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay An-on, where do you live?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh no.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uhhh about that… I-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Vivir en Skin Row? I already know that." Rosa lets out a chuckle. "I mean what is your address?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hope she's okay with this…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I tell her my address, and to my surprise, she doesn't object to driving her car to one of the shittest and most dangerous parts of town. Even the taxi driver wouldn't dare set foot there.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No te muevas, we'll be there soon!" Rosa chirps from the driver's seat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Enjoying the ride, I lean my head back against the seat and look towards the window to my right, wishing to see the city pass by as the car moves.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">However, I see a familiar face staring back at me rather than my own reflection. The face shoots a smug smile, contrasting my disturbed face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Christ, bad enough you fucked everything up with Fang and me. But now you're gonna drag Stella and Rosa into your shit too?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser, why are you here? Why now?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No no no no no, go away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What's wrong? Too scared to face the consequences of your actions?" Naser seemingly replies to my own thoughts with a laugh and flashes a smug smirk in my direction. "I knew you were a pussy, but I didn't think you were this sad."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No, none of this is real. The Naser I knew wouldn't talk like this, nor would he be this vindictive.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Aww, am I being too mean? Maybe if you weren't such a shitty friend to everyone around you, maybe they wouldn't be so 'vindictive.'" Naser pointed his finger at me through the reflection while echoing the last word in a mocking tone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So… Be honest with me here, are you gonna let them die too?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Please… No no no no</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Like you did with me?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stop…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Leave me THE FUCK ALONE!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It takes me a second to realize that I said these words aloud, as the car suddenly came to a stop, and a rather confused voice called out from the driver's seat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"¿Qué demonios? An-on what's wrong?" Rosa asks with a confused tone as she turns around to face me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Shit… How do I even explain this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry Rosa, I uh… thought I saw a bee."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"A bee?" Rosa replies flatly. "Did you also see a bee this morning in the kitchen? Por favor, tell me what's wrong."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, it's nothing, Rosa! Just your average hallucination! Don't worry about it. I'm just a schizo having arguments with dead people. Everything's perfectly fine here!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hallucinations?" Rosa inquires with a degree of shock and concern.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck. I mumbled that… Well, I guess I HAVE to explain now…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay… Okay… I'll tell you everything, Rosa, but let's continue on the road."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rosa agrees with a nod before shifting the car from 'park' to 'drive', which kind of surprised me a bit since I thought she would refuse and stop the car to hear the whole conversation first.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay An-on, tell me everything."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I let out a defeated sigh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I still see Fang every day… Naser and Naomi too, they visit me… To remind me of all the mistakes I've made, and how I let them die."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rosa's face has a mixture of shock and confusion, evidenced by her reflection in the driver's mirror.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"They… visit you?" she inquired.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I nod. "I mean… Yes and no, I know they're dead, but it still feels real, and they come to haunt me by reminding me of how badly I fucked up, how everyone died because of my actions." I explain, exhaustion plaguing my voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That's why I freaked out in the kitchen, I dreamed last night that Fang shot up the entire school, and I mean the entire school. But when I woke up, I saw Fang aiming a gun at Stella's head."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can hear Rosa mutter something in Spanish while behind the wheel, clearly shocked by my revelation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Dios mío... And, you've been having these nightmares and hallucinations since?" she inquires, sadness and sympathy plaguing her voice, I see the conflict on her face from the driver's mirror, as if she wants to stop the car.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I answer her question with a nod of my head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, It started after around the time I left the hospital. I visited the cemetery and watched Fang and Naser's funeral, from a distance, of course… I didn't deserve to be there. I've made them all suffer enough." I confess while fighting every urge in my body, begging me to stop talking. "And… When I got home that night, that's when I first saw Fang. She just stood there, leering at me, eyes full of contempt and hate."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"If it weren't for me, she'd still be alive, they'd all still be alive-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My confession is interrupted as the car comes to a sudden stop and Rosa raises her voice from behind the wheel.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"¡Ni una palabra más!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rosa unbuckles her seatbelt and turns from the driver's seat, facing me. Her face full of sadness, concern, anger, and her eyes were on the verge of tears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I told you! None of this is your fault An-on!" Rosa shouts, slapping her hand against the glovebox, emphasizing her point. "Fang was a monstruo. She always has been! You couldn't have stopped her. Nobody could."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's wrong. She wasn't a monster, not to me… She was just… lost…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rosa stretches out her left hand past her seat and takes hold of my own left hand, giving it a tight squeeze.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You're not alone An-on, No más." Gazing into my eyes deeply as her voice breaks slightly. "Fang… Era pura maldad.""</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But-" I attempt to interject before being cut off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fang made YOU suffer, not the other way around!" She tightens her grip on my hand, accidentally causing a small amount of pain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You don't have to hide your pain, not with me, not with Stella. We're here for you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You are?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course, para qué sirven los amigos?" I apparently mumbled that out loud as Rosa's lips creep into a smile. "Before you woke up, Stella was telling me just how happy she was that we found you again. We were so worried about what happened to you after the shooting!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I haven't seen that happy in a long time An-on."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Really, me? Why?" I ask.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I can't say too much, but…." Rosa hesitates before finding the right words. "Stella sees a bit of herself in you, and it makes her happy to see that there's someone she can relate to."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Someone she can relate to… Wait, is she referring to Stella's anime obsession? Plus, I'm pretty sure Stella enjoys gardening too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wait, she can't relate to you? I thought you guys were best friends?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, we are for sure, she's like a Hermana to me!" Rosa's face lights up, seemingly worried that I got the wrong idea from her statement. "But you know, she has her passions, and I have my own."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"De todos modos, I wanted to ask. Stella and I are planning to get lunch on Friday, and we wanted to ask if you would like to come?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They want me to come to lunch with them?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean… Money is really tight right now, I can't really afford to be blowing it all on eating out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But it was nice to see them again, I still don't know what to make of this but… Part of me wants to see them again, and to know that I won't be alone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah. I'd like that Rosa."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Delight washes across the ankylosaur's face as she finally lets go of my hand, leaving behind a slight shade of blue across the skin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Maravilloso! I'll be sure to fill you in all the details soon!" Rosa turns back to face the windshield and adjusts the car from park to drive as we continue our journey to Skin Row.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I'm contemplating her words and her invitation, a new wave of emotions washes over me, contrasting the ones that have plagued my mind for the past five months.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anticipation, satisfaction, perhaps even joy?</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm not alone anymore?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">One day earlier…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Those eyes look up at me, begging, fucking pathetic.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"W-wait-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck you...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"SHUT THE FUCK UP!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*THUD*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I slam the metal bat against his chest, again and again, each swing more brutal than the last. This bastard fucking dies today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*THUD* *THUD* *THUD*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You took everything away from me!" I roar with hate. "Just fucking die! Skinnie piece of shit!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I get a couple of swings against his leg for good measure, I hear a sharp crack as the metal meets his skin. Good…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*THUD* *THUD* *THUD*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck he's passed out, no good.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Get the fuck up!" I shout at the grovelling little monkey giving him a kick in the groin. "I need you awake for this."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I raise the baseball bat towards his head, and before I can bash his brains out, a voice calls out from the car behind and distracts me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"R-rosa!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is that.. Stella?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">""¡OYE! ¡ALÉJATE DE ÉL!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">W-what? Rosa?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*HONK* *HONK* *HONK* HONK*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fucking hell, everyone in the ass-end of skin row is gonna hear that, I gotta get out of here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't wanna leave my work unfinished... But I'll find him again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I give him a sharp kick to the leg again, causing him to cry out and take off as quickly as I can, taking a quick turn into the alleyway to my right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't know if they're following me or not, so I instinctively take cover behind one of the dumpsters, fuck everyone who ever talked shit about me being short.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wait a few moments, anticipating the footsteps of my pursuers to become louder and louder. Still, all I hear is the distant yelling of Spanish?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"¿QUÉ ESTÁS HACIENDO? ¡VEN Y AYÚDAME A METERLO EN EL COCHE! ¡AHORA!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't speak Spanish, so I can only assume Rosa's calling me out. Fucking cunt, why would she and Stella save a worthless human who did nothing but cause misery for everyone around him? It's a mystery to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't just stand there! Help me get him to the van, Vamos!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait… They're not coming after me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My suspicions come true as ears are greeted by the obnoxious sound of rubber hitting the cracked pavement road as the tire's screeching becomes fainter and fainter. I can only assume they're gone now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck the both of them, fuck Anon, fuck that weirdo anime-loving stego bitch, and fuck that stupid religious fascist.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The heavy painting caused by my adrenaline quickly turns into rage. Why couldn't I finish the job? Why couldn't I make things right for Fang?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My grip on the bat tightens.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">WHY COULDN'T I JUST FUCKING KILL ANON?? GODDAMNIT!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The dumpster echoes throughout the alleyway with a 'twang' sound as I take out my rage by beating the object as hard as I can.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*TWANG*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">FUCKING!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*TWANG*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">SKINNIE!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*TWANG*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">BASTARD!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And then, as if I had the wind knocked out of me, I dropped the bat to the ground, and I'm left with exhaustion as I seethe with cold hatred.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And beneath that, sorrow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No friends left, the family wants nothing to do with me, no real future, and Fang is gone… Forever…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This world is nothing but a black pit, filled with the shittiest of people.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...The job's not over yet. I still have work to do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I crouch down and reach under the dumpster to pull out a worn black duffel bag, the kind that hockey players usually use to store their equipment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I still can't believe I had to wear this ridiculous fucking outfit when I pulled this job. Raptor Jesus, I look like a character from one of Riley's video games.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No time better than now to get this shit off, I remove the paintball mask first as the cold wind hits my face, kissing my scales with its cool icy wind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Dropping the mask as it lands into the bag, I began taking off all the other articles of my clothing, along with the steel-toed boots I was wearing, leaving me standing in an alley in my socks, wearing nothing but a tank top and some light shorts. It also doesn't help that I'm doing all of this during a particularly cold autumn night in a dark alleyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eager to warm myself up, I unzip the bag, revealing a clean pair of clothes consisting of my favorite yellow hoodie accompanied by my typical track pants and red boots, my typical outfit. Also one of the only things I could grab when I left home.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I begin to dress myself rather as quickly as I can while hiding behind the dumpster, I don't want some perv to see me half-naked in an alleyway. The cold makes it difficult to move my arms around the hoodie and properly fit them in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After rather hastily getting dressed, all that's left to put everything away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I pick up the bat, noticing the slight blood stains on it. I begin to carefully 'wrap' with the getup I just disguised myself in, kind of like a Christmas present.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After putting the clothes away and zipping the bag shut, all that's left is to head to Lil Tru' and get rid of this shit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And go to one of the few places that haven't abandoned me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">About an hour passes, and I finally enter one of the livelier areas of Little Troodon. This part of town kind of reminds me of home, making me feel at ease, even if only briefly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Approaching the end of the street corner, I turn around and instantly spot my destination.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Dino Moes</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I approach the restaurant entrance, I glance through the windows to see the establishment filled almost to its entirety.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm honestly surprised. Why the hell are there so many people here on a Sunday night? Just what I fucking needed, an entire building full of people to see some 'triceratops thug' carry a duffel bag containing a bad Halloween costume and a bloody bat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Let's just get this over with…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I enter the restaurant, opening the door with one hand, carefully not to hit the door with my bag, a bell rings at my arrival and my nostrils are hit with the overwhelming scent of cheese, tomato sauce, and meat. Carnivore meat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Welcome to the historic Dino-Moes, table for one?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A human woman calls to me with an unenthusiastic expression. Dressed in a typical apron and hat with the Dino Moes logo.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm here to see the manager." I reply curtly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay, hang on." she turns to her left and calls out. "We got a code K at the front desk!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"A KAREN?!I'M COMIN! I'M COMIN!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Code K… Did this bitch just call me a karen? I've had enough monkeys to deal with today already.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Finally, the jolly-looking Tyrannosaurus Rex comes from around the corner where the server was looking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"AY TRISH! GOOD TO SEE YA, JUST COME IN MY OFFICE IN DA BACK, I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YA!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Will do Moe." I dryly nod as I begin to heed his direction, passing by all of the tables of people having their dinner as they stare at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuck are they looking at? 'Oh no triceratops, she's gonna ruin our shitty dinner.' It takes all that I have to resist the urge to tell these shitheads off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I finally entered the room in the back to see a rather well maintained and clean office, compiled with a filing cabinet, some shelves containing various awards and framed newspapers, with of course some booze. Centered against the wall laid a rather clean-looking oak desk, the only objects on it were a filing board and two glasses.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm surprised Moe manages to keep this place so clean, considering those arms of his.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I sit in the chair adjacent to the wall as I continue to wait for the lively Tyrannosaurus Rex.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm overwhelmed with the thoughts that have been racing through my head the past few days. Are my siblings okay? Why isn't Reed answering my texts?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why couldn't I kill that Skinnie bastard?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I had him right where I wanted him, but before I could finish things, those two goodie losers from school showed up and ruined things. Why would they even want to protect a piece of shit like him?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon. Ruined. Everything. He took Fang away from me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang, my bandmate, my best friend, my l-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"ALRIGHTYS, sorry bout dat! Just had ta deal wit' some tables, ya know how it is." Moe finally enters the office, interrupting my contemplation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I turn around to see the usually 'larger than life' grin from the restaurant's owner dissipates to a rather calm one, betraying his usual persona as the door closes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So… Did ya do it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yup." I nod as I unzip the duffel bag to show the blood-stained bat, along with the shitty disguise.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Moe lets out a deep sigh as he walks over to the shelf and grabs a bottle of whiskey.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y'know, we normally don't serve unda-aged patrons here, but you'se looks like you'se could some." He offers as he brings the bottle back to his desk, setting it by the glasses in front of me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm not a patron."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Heh, I beg ta differ, considering all the jobs you'se taken from me the past two months!" He chuckles as he pours the whiskey into the glasses, filling them both with auburn ambrosia. But not before placing an envelope in front of me, I can briefly make out shades of green through the paper.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You know I didn't do this for the Money."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, but you'se be an idiot not to take it." Moe shrugs before his look becomes more serious. "Look, let me be real with you, kid."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Da only reason I had you'se do dis was cause I owed a buddy a favour, not that ol' Moe here had much choice." He explains. "Hopefully now dat you taught dis punk a lesson, he won't be a problem for im no' more."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"If you didn't want him to be a problem anymore, you should have given me a gun, not a bat."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My retort elicits a groan from Moe in response as he begins to rub his eyes while struggling to do so.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Look, kid, we've already been over dis. You've done good work so far, offerin' security and whatnot. But I don't need a hitman."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fucking coward, of course he doesn't have the balls to see what needs to be done.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You're kidding, right? That piece of shit deserves to die, if it weren't for him Fang would still be alive-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"LISTEN!-" Moe's voice bellows through the office, cutting me off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Listen… I mean, yeah, maybe you'se right and he is a piece a'shit."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe? He IS that and more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But dis obsession of yours with dat Anon kid isn't healthy. It's gonna eat ya up, but it's not too late! You'se a good kid, you'se can stop takin' jobs from me and get back on da right path." Moe attempts to convince me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's not too late to take back ya life."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the hell does he know? I pick up the glass and down the entire glass. The harsh liquid trickling down my throat helps ease my nerves before sitting it back down on the desk.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"My life ended a long time ago, Moe."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I proceed to stand up and walk towards the exit, but I call out before I open the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'll be back next Friday."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My response elicits yet another sigh from him as he further deflates in his desk and picks up his own glass.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, sure. Be seeing ya Trish."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I exit back into the restaurant and close the door behind me. Doing my best to avoid looking at those nosy pricks at the tables as they glance my way with judging eyes. What the hell do they know?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Have a good day." The skinnie server calls to me with a dull expression as I promptly ignore her and walk out the door, once again ringing the entry bell.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Now that that's dealt with, I just want to get back to my apartment and not have to worry about anyone else, Moe and his high and mighty bullshit, or Reed just being high in general.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After what happened that day, Reed really started to lose himself with that carfe shit. I'm not even sure how much of him is left to be honest. Eh, hopefully, he should be preoccupied when I get back though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I walk home through the dark streets of Little Trodon, my mind continues to be overwhelmed as I'm reminded by just how shitty life has been.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After I proved to be disappointing as always, my family threw me away, failing school and just being a shitty sister.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The former has been particularly fucking me over the most. Not many places want to hire a triceratops dropout. 'Oh I'm just another bad egg! I'm just gonna cause trouble!' Fuck all of them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And worst of all, that fucking skinnie still lives. Who the fuck does he think he is? He comes out of nowhere and ruins VVURM DRAMA, destroys everything we had, and…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He took Fang away from us… from me…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I loved them… more than anything else, and he fucking killed them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I swear, I will find him again, and I will bash his brains out when I find him next.</div>
