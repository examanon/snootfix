(You) post a story on your favourite mongolian basketweaver forum about how you've won a ticket to a fancy romantic ice skating evening date whatever, and subsequently got chased by dino girls for the opportunity to attend. (Everyone still studies at Volcano High during xmas cause fuck logic.)</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>>44188799</div><div class="fanfic-line">>be me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>be 19yo /r9k/ reject /fit/izen</div><div class="fanfic-line">>be attending highschool at dino town cause i'm a retard and got transferred (its a long story)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it fucking sucks cause literally 99.99% of the students are meteor dodgers</div><div class="fanfic-line">(there's ONE other human but he's an interspecies normalfag anyway so who cares)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>they're also unimaginably social like i can't even read manga during break periods cause some dinosaur cunt always tries talking to me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>one such cunt from the student council ropes me into helping out with the xmas party prep</div><div class="fanfic-line">>let's call her head bitch cause she's one of the popular girls, her real name is Nicole or whatever</div><div class="fanfic-line">>really i only agreed to make her shut up cause goddamn she can talk</div><div class="fanfic-line">(i have no idea how anyone can tolerate her, starting with her beta fag bf but i guess he's also an autist cause his nickname is Laser (i'm not making it up i swear wait till u hear about his "sister"))</div><div class="fanfic-line">>apparently my job will be serving punch like a fucking waiter</div><div class="fanfic-line">>whatever, at least people won't ask me why im being weird and not dancing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>as if anyone would want to dance with me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>sadcaveman dot rockpeg</div><div class="fanfic-line">>said xmas party comes around and im serving these assholes their drinks</div><div class="fanfic-line">>don't even bother trying to make smalltalk</div><div class="fanfic-line">>keep considering if i should spill it over the more expensive looking dresses "on accident"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>end up not doing it cause it would be too much trouble (the principal is a huge dick and borderline abusive)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>though by the end i swear if they played last christmas one more time i was gonna flip the whole table over</div><div class="fanfic-line">>btw i still had to pay for my ticket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>now this is important, cause it's automatically also an entry to the party lottery bowl thing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>grand prize is a two-person week-long deluxe VIP ticket to a once-in-a-year xmas event the city hosts for its top 1%</div><div class="fanfic-line">(all i really know about it is that they're gonna open up the ice skating ring by the biggest fanciest hotel in town)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>well guess who won it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>take a fucking guess</div><div class="fanfic-line">>why of course I have, beating normalfags to the punch (pun intended)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>head bitch called me out on the stage and all that</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"wow anon who's the special girl you're gonna take?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she had to be jealous as fuck cause i'm 99% sure everyone knows i don't have a gf</div><div class="fanfic-line">(i'm also pretty sure she tried to rig the whole thing anyway)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i have no idea what i've answered her cause i was so nervous i literally fainted</div><div class="fanfic-line">>just as a reminder: for some strange reason i'm not popular</div><div class="fanfic-line">>got taken to the school nurse then home</div><div class="fanfic-line">>by the time i get home every cunt in the school and their mother messaged me asking to be my date</div><div class="fanfic-line">>feels good caveman</div><div class="fanfic-line">>or rather it would if they gave two fucks about me any other day</div><div class="fanfic-line">>plus im not even into interspecies</div><div class="fanfic-line">>pick a random handful of them and reply various pickup lines i found online</div><div class="fanfic-line">>two chicks from the gardening club</div><div class="fanfic-line">>some rando trigga</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the stoner dude i've always suspected to be gay but maybe he's asking for his gf or something</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i'm fairly certain i won't bother going so i'll just try pawning the ticket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>head bitch messaged me too, though her facade is the least believable (not to mention the mere existence of Laser but i guess she's ready to cuck him lmao)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"omg anon r u ok?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"will u be ok?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"maybe u shouldnt go to the party!!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"what r u gonna do with the ticket?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"if u cant go"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i don't reply just go the fuck to sleep (it's a friday btw)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>by morning i get even more messages, plus a few replies</div><div class="fanfic-line">>there's also a missed call from head bitch</div><div class="fanfic-line">>decide to be chad and ignore all of them as if i was a busy person</div><div class="fanfic-line">>play pokémon red in the meantime</div><div class="fanfic-line">>consider going to the gym but i can't be assed to (inb4 ngmi nogainz, it's called muscle confusion)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>suddenly there's a knock on the door</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it's head bitch</div><div class="fanfic-line">>says she came over to check on me cause i'm a "precious member of the student body and her dear friend"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>yeah sure</div><div class="fanfic-line">>btw i have no idea how she tracked down where i live and it's fucking creepy</div><div class="fanfic-line">(pretty much all humans in dino city live in/surrounding the ghetto, including me)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>this may surprise you, but i've never had a girl over</div><div class="fanfic-line">>or been alone with one, really</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i sit her down by the kitchen counter cause i literally only have one chair and it's there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>offer her a glass of (tap) water cause i'm also a cheap fuck and only have discount beer on hand otherwise</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it's fucking awkward.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>anyway i'm pretty sure she's only here for the ticket so i don't care that much</div><div class="fanfic-line">>keep imagining she actually wants to cuck Laserboi and i need to constantly hide my boner</div><div class="fanfic-line">>im not even into dinos wtf</div><div class="fanfic-line">>tho to be honest she's wearing a big bulky fucking wintercoat, so it's not like she's trying to seduce me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>or so i thought but the ride was just about to begin</div><div class="fanfic-line">>after like five minutes of talking about the weather and what she wants to gift her grandma for christmas she makes her move</div><div class="fanfic-line">>in an overly dramatic motion she starts fanning herself with one hand and opening her coat with the other</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"wow anon it's so hot in here"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"uhm no it's not the heater isn't even on"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i mean that was true, i only ever let the temperature go over about 75 degrees when i'm taking a shower or something</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she wasn't fazed by my autism tho and dropped the coat</div><div class="fanfic-line">>my fucking face when she's only wearing linergie under it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>like idk the name, kind of a nightgown? it wasn't see-through but i'm p sure it's not something you wear outside normally</div><div class="fanfic-line">>also that fucking clevage</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so yeah, i fucking froze but at the same time sweating bullets</div><div class="fanfic-line">>guess i no longer needed to hide my boner but tried to anyway (i swear im not an interspecies fag)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so she comes up to me all stacy-like and takes me by the hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"aww anon you're sweating, sure you're feeling okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"maybe i should help get you into bed? tee-hee"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she was also trying to push my arm between her boobs but i'm too swole to control</div><div class="fanfic-line">>diamond dick dot tagged image rock format</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so naturally i freak the fuck out and accidentally throw her across the kitchen</div><div class="fanfic-line">>like i tried to push her away gently but my muscles kinda spazzed out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and again im fit af so i literally yeeted her facefirst into the oven</div><div class="fanfic-line">>her head made a loud fucking BONG sound on the metal sheet</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so she's laying there unconscious or like i'm pretty sure she's actually dead</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so i panicked</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and ran out of the flat</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and i also may have locked her inside</div><div class="fanfic-line">(i wasn't thinking so sue me)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>as i try to calm down i take random streets</div><div class="fanfic-line">>end up by the school due to habit i think</div><div class="fanfic-line">>can hear several students milling about (track club and stuff)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>sit on a bench trying to figure out how to dispose of a dead body, probably dissolving in acid or something</div><div class="fanfic-line">>wondering if i could look at her tits or if that would be too disrespectful to her spirit or whatever (so what i'm a moralfag, i also don't pirate games)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>tbqh i was still kinda horny too but i guess having sex with a literal corpse is over the line</div><div class="fanfic-line">>in the middle of this dilemma a couple of girls come up to me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>my first instinct is to blow them off somehow, but then i realize they're the girls from the gardening club i ended up replying to last night</div><div class="fanfic-line">>one of them is a latina so i call her Hosé (idk her real name), the other is a weeb so let's call her weeb</div><div class="fanfic-line">>weeb asks me what i'm doing there and if i came cause i have detention</div><div class="fanfic-line">(all detention is pretty much handled by the gardening club cause the teachers literally can't be bothered to stay for like thirty minutes after classes end)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>tell her that i just happened to be there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>like im gonna admit that im a murderer on the run</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hosé asks if i'm cold</div><div class="fanfic-line">>realize i left the flat in a boxer and shirt</div><div class="fanfic-line">>realize i don't have my phone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>realize im literally holding my keys and wallet (with the ticket) in my hands</div><div class="fanfic-line">>realize head bitch didn't even question why i was in a boxer and a shirt (prob cause she was busy mirin too bad she's dead now)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"nah i'm okay"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>they don't fucking buy it and insist i go with them to get clothes from the club's found items stash or whatever</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i try getting out of it but they're too pushy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>end up getting walked by the two girls with each of them clinging to one of my arms so i don't run away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>tfw the entire gardening club has to watch me taking both girls to the club office</div><div class="fanfic-line">>gigachad dot portable rock format</div><div class="fanfic-line">(btw in case ur wondering what gardening in the winter looks like these dudes were clipping branches and putting up plasting tents over some flowers, so they weren't actually hacking away at the frozen ground like a bunch of assholes)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>anyway i was kinda suspecting that it's only about the ticket but then again they didn't mention it and it was true i was getting cold so i just went with it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>they keep chatting between themselves all the way (for which im thankful btw so i don't out myself as a retard)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>their office was kinda nice, had a tv and a big couch and stuff</div><div class="fanfic-line">>there were also sacks of fertilizer lined up by the wall, so in essence the room smelled like shit</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it didn't seem to bother the girls so i acted like it's no big deal</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hosé disappeared into another room that i guess is their storage or something, so im left with weeb</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she sits me down on the couch and stands in front of me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>like, real fucking close</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i mean her legs were pretty much between my knees, but they weren't touching my skin</div><div class="fanfic-line">>idk if im explaining property but i couldn't move or i'd touch her and i didn't dare to</div><div class="fanfic-line">>even though it's deadass winter, weeb was only wearing booty jeans and a light jacket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>her thighs are thick af and in my face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>boner is a go and i can barely conceal it so it's even more awkward (for the recond im NOT into interspecies like certain other degenerates)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>we listen to Hosé looking for stuff in the other room but otherwise it's silent</div><div class="fanfic-line">>keep thinking about something to say</div><div class="fanfic-line">>weeb is just looking down at me smiling and wagging her tail</div><div class="fanfic-line">>or idk if it's called wagging, she was like swinging it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>point is that it made her thighs and ass jiggle</div><div class="fanfic-line">>like a forever later Hosé returns with a blanket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"sorry anon i couldn't find anything in your size"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"but we're gonna help you keep warm!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i'm fairly sure i blacked out again cause the next thing i know is that we're all sitting on the couch under the blanket, me in the middle</div><div class="fanfic-line">>my shirt is off, and im no longer holding my wallet and keys</div><div class="fanfic-line">>plus the girls are all cuddled up next to me with one of their hands on each of my legs and like sorta massaging my muscles (bitches be mirin)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>oh fuck</div><div class="fanfic-line">>am i gonna have a fucking threesome?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>weeb murmurs something into my ear</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"so anon-kun, about that ticket..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hosé doubles down before i could react</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"i bet we can help you decide who deserves it, si papa?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>as they speak their hands zero in on my dick</div><div class="fanfic-line">>literally the nanosecond they touch it i spring up from the couch and run off</div><div class="fanfic-line">>or like try to run off but i get entangled with the blanket and fall into the stack of fertilizer</div><div class="fanfic-line">>dirt and what i assume to be literal pieces of manure shower the room and cover both girls</div><div class="fanfic-line">>they start shrieking as i fumble out the door</div><div class="fanfic-line">>can clearly hear weeb screaming that it got into her mouth</div><div class="fanfic-line">>proceed to run away into the school building proper, blindly taking corners</div><div class="fanfic-line">>at this point im mostly naked, cold, covered in shit, horny as fuck, and panicking</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so of course i run into someone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it's the other human in the school, the interspecies fag</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i have no earthly idea what's his name is so i'll call him interspecies fag like the degenerate he is, as opposed to the virtous image of swole grace that is me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>we both fall onto the floor cursing at one another</div><div class="fanfic-line">>a second later he calls out loudly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fang i found him!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">(okay this needs some explaining bear with me. so "Fang" is Laserboi's "sister" i meantioned earlier, and yes that is "her" name. Fang the dinosaur. again, i'm not making this shit up, she's this unironic 3edgy5me daddy issues punk-goth girl that always gets into trouble, like for fucking with the cars in the parking lot and stuff. i think she's trying to huff the air from the tires but idk. anyway she's also """nonbinary""" and got interspecies fag simping for whatever reason. plus she's the laughingstock of the school and im not just saying these things cause she's a meanine and calls me names ok?? i don't even like her and im not into interspecies for the hundredth fucking time, i seriously DO NOT have a crush on her)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>at first i have no idea why they're looking for me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i assume it's for the ticket but it also could be revenge for head bitch cause she's interspecies fag's gf's brother's gf</div><div class="fanfic-line">>jerryspringer.rockpeg</div><div class="fanfic-line">>hear Fang shouting from further down the corridor</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"don't let that fucker get away!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>interspecies fag tries to grab me but my skin is slick with sweat and manure so he can't get a grip</div><div class="fanfic-line">>lmao git gud</div><div class="fanfic-line">>im also fit af so i could just lay him out but decide not to</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i mean he's not that bad built either, i'd might even give him a spot (no homo)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>anyway i ran the fuck away back the way i came</div><div class="fanfic-line">>except oh fuck the gardening chicks are coming up the same hallway</div><div class="fanfic-line">>im blocked on both ends</div><div class="fanfic-line">>a door opens in my face and someone janks me inside a classroom</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it's the gay stoner dude</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i have no idea why and how he's here</div><div class="fanfic-line">>without much explanation he pushes me towards a door on the opposite wall</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the classroom is a tech lab so it's pretty big and touches two corridors</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"go anon i'll hold them back but you better not forget your end of the deal!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i have no idea what deal he means</div><div class="fanfic-line">>probably one of his messages regarding the ticket, i didn't actually read any of them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>still i take the opportunity</div><div class="fanfic-line">>after several minutes of (stealthily) running around the school i make it to the gym hall</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i didn't really have a destination but i figured i could hide in the men's locker, maybe even find some clothes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>anything so long as i'm not lynched by one group or the other</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so i burst into the room</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and there's someone already there and she's calling me out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"took you long enough you fucking retard"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"wait what the fuck happened to you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it's that lil' purple trigga girl i've messaged</div><div class="fanfic-line">>did i apparently make a deal with her too?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i try to hush her but she's having none of it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"jesus christ anon are you into scat stuff?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"i'm not fucking touching you like that"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"go take a shower and be glad i'm so patient"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i really wish i could check on my messages right about now, but i don't have my phone</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i assume she whored herself out for the ticket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>at least she's more straightforward than all the others</div><div class="fanfic-line">>since we're in the men's room anyway i go take that shower</div><div class="fanfic-line">>not like there are a lot of options, at least i won't be covered in shit</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it's a big shower room kinda thing for about ten guys at a time, so being in there alone is kinda creepy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i keep my boxers on as well, im not getting assraped by ghosts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it's generally cold outside too so the room fills with steam in a minute or two</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i start thinking about what the fuck to do about this whole ordeal</div><div class="fanfic-line">>HOWEVER</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i hear footsteps closing in</div><div class="fanfic-line">>panic dot shaman audio format</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i mean there are multiple groups that want to beat me up, and there's a gay guy who i might owe a dick sucking to</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i don't want to get caught in the shower by any of them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"who's there?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>my voice only cracks a little</div><div class="fanfic-line">>turns out trigga wasn't as patient as she claimed to be and now she's intruding on me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she probably got turned on by my greek god bod</div><div class="fanfic-line">>even though she's like two feet from me i can't see much from the steam</div><div class="fanfic-line">>but i can clearly tell she's fucking naked</div><div class="fanfic-line">>ngl she's kinda hot, even packing some abs and she has HUGE FAT TITS (still not into interspecies)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>at the same time she has this resting bitch look on her face like this is so beneath her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>well fuck you i'm not the one slutting it up for a ticket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"lets just get this over with"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"you have five minutes"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"if you can't get it up that's not my problem, loser"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>with that she turns her back to me and pushes her body against the wall</div><div class="fanfic-line">>idk what the name of the position is supposed to be, just imagine her ass up bent over clinging to the wall</div><div class="fanfic-line">>my heart is fucking racing as i stare at her ass in disbelief (btw she has freckles on her buttcheeks)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>this is gonna be a surprise i know but actually i'm a virgin</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so i didn't really know how to, like, handle the situation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i've imagined many times how my first time having sex would be, and i mean i'd like to take the lead but uh</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she was also a LOT shorter than me so i almost had to descend into a horse riding stance</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i felt really retarded</div><div class="fanfic-line">>trigga looked annoyed too</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"so are you gonna gimme--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"s-so are you gonna do it or what"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"just pick a hole and get on with it already"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"fucking limpdick"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>by that point i was getting really fucking nervous</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so i tried to find a way to rationalize the situation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i mean yeah i know i'm a moralfag but it didn't seem right to have sex with someone for a ticket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>maybe if i could pay her afterwards</div><div class="fanfic-line">>then i fucking realized</div><div class="fanfic-line">>that i left my wallet back in the gardening club office</div><div class="fanfic-line">>or perhaps the girls have it on them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>shit shit shit</div><div class="fanfic-line">>FUCK</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so i ran</div><div class="fanfic-line">>trigga was shouting stuff at me the whole way like</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"hey where the fuck are you going i NEED THAT DI-- TICKET"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so i grabbed the first articles of clothing i could get my hands on, being trigga's clothes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>they were a tight fucking fit and im sure her pants ripped around my ass but i had boxers on anyway</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it's better than nothing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>she almost caught me, but i was way too quick for her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>fucking dinolets when will they learn lol</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so i start the stealth mission back to the tech lab, cause that seemed the shortest way to my objective</div><div class="fanfic-line">>also because i didn't know the layout all that well but that's irrelevant</div><div class="fanfic-line">>first i tried to listen in through the door cause maybe they laid a trap for me or something</div><div class="fanfic-line">>can't hear shit, so i crack the door open</div><div class="fanfic-line">>gay dude is the only one in there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>he's clearly surprised by my change of attire</div><div class="fanfic-line">>no time to explain</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i try to rush by him but he stops me (it's fucking hard to move in these clothes btw)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"whoah hold on anon"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"we made a deal, remember?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>again, i don't remember any such deal, but i can't tell him that (would be too embarassing)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>understandabily i don't want to swallow his spunk either, gainz or nogainz</div><div class="fanfic-line">>decide to try and figure out what the deal we made was</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i ask him if he's gay</div><div class="fanfic-line">>even though i was 80% sure he was, he's taken aback</div><div class="fanfic-line">>then he gets angry</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"fuck no bro, that's not what i meant!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"christ, is that all you wanted? that's fucked up dude!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>mfw i have no face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>literally have no idea what he's talking about or how to reply to this</div><div class="fanfic-line">>what's worse, i hear voices from just outside the classroom</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"he's in here!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it's Hosé</div><div class="fanfic-line">>a second later she bursts in, followed closely by the weeb chick</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i try to make my escape but the gay guy (who's now angry at me for whatever reason) puts me into a chokehold</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"nuh-uh, you're not going anywhere dude"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the two girls circle around the desks and random scientific instruments till they get to us</div><div class="fanfic-line">>around the same time Fang and her orbiter also enter the room</div><div class="fanfic-line">>followed by a VERY ANGRY trigga in tow (she's got a towel tightly wrapped around her body)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>followed by Laserboi and head bitch</div><div class="fanfic-line">>huh, so apparently she didn't die</div><div class="fanfic-line">>that's a relief (except now i won't get to see her tits probably)</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so now there's a small crowd here, made of people angry at me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>guess i fucked up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>they're all looking at eachother with visible confusion</div><div class="fanfic-line">>makes sense btw, i mean head bitch has a large fucking bump on her head, trigga is mostly naked, weeb and Hosé are covered in shit, etc</div><div class="fanfic-line">>nobody really knows what to do</div><div class="fanfic-line">>gay dude, bless his soul, takes charge of the situation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>he lets off with the choking and instead grabs into the pullover i'm wearing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"okay bro, decide. now."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"decide what?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i realize that im probably clinically retarded but i really don't know what he means</div><div class="fanfic-line">>pick who gets to beat me up? or in which order?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>trigga is fast to the rescue, in her usual hateful manner of course</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"the fucking ticket you dickwad! give it up!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>oh yeah, now that she mentions it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"...i don't have it on me"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>multiple people move in to slap some sense into me (i assume), but gay dude stops them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"where is it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"i left it in the gardening club office"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the two shit covered girls immediately make a run for it, followed by everyone else in the room</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i consider using this opportunity to escape, but my wallet and keys are also in there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>also because fuck them, it's my ticket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so we all go back to the club office</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it stinks fucking horribly, like you can smell it from two hallways away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the different groups start fighting eachother, to the point where almost a full-on brawl breaks out</div><div class="fanfic-line">>they're also tearing the xmas decor from the walls n stuff</div><div class="fanfic-line">>somewhere along the way trigga lost her towel and is now trying to hide behind a trashcan</div><div class="fanfic-line">>that's some excellent christmas cheer, damn</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i make my way through the crowd and despite all odds manage to grab my wallet first</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so i climb onto the shit covered couch and hold the wallet up in the air like it was some artifact or a bag of cash</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the amalgam of retarded ass dino bitches try clawing their way up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>doomguycdart.rockpeg</div><div class="fanfic-line">>with E1M1 playing in my head i pull the ticket from between the banknotes, throwing the wallet away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and tear it in half</div><div class="fanfic-line">>silence descends upon the room at once</div><div class="fanfic-line">>then i proceed to rip the pieces into even smaller pieces</div><div class="fanfic-line">>then toss the pieces up in the air</div><div class="fanfic-line">>silence</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i'm trying to come up with a cool one liner, but too much time have passed now and it wouldn't be cool anymore</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i still try nevertheless</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"whether your words..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"...are lies created to deceive me..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"...or the truth that I have sought all my life..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"...it makes no difference."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"you will rot"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>with that i make my way through the stunned crowd, grab my keys and leave the room</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i hear no sound till i exit the building, guess my cool speech left them awestruck afterall</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and that was pretty much the end of the ride</div><div class="fanfic-line">>i guess they all made up eventually</div><div class="fanfic-line">>they never beat me up either</div><div class="fanfic-line">>what's more, for trying to trick me they all collectively put together the money to buy another two-person ticket (albeit not VIP) for me, and this time left the decision solely to me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>it was actually a pretty nice gesture</div><div class="fanfic-line">>so naturally i sold it for thrice the price on ebay, and gifted myself a new console for christmas</div><div class="fanfic-line">>lmao normalfags and their parties git fucking gud (told you i'm not into interspecies)</div>
