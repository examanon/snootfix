                    <div class="fanfic-line">Reeda And Stella</div><div class="fanfic-line">Chapter 2 - (Hacked Up://Sign)</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A spotlight’s beam blinded Reeda for a moment. Wherever she was, the darkness around her buzzed with excitement as thousands of tantalized mumbles, jeers, and wolf whistles ambushed her from all sides.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ding ding!</div><div class="fanfic-line">A bell rang, reminding her of all those years falling asleep to WWE re-runs. She then looked to herself and her eyes bugged out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">A puce, v-shaped lycra bikini hugged against her toned body, the color scheme nearly matching her hot pink scales.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before she could process what was going on, a flash of green slammed into her stomach with the force of a steel girder, knocking more than the wind from her as she shot across the mat like a skipping stone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was definitely a sakuga moment. One could marvel at how much effort and investment it took for a full twenty-four frames per second just to see Reeda tumble. Each full somersault depicted some cleavage, bush, and her shocked expression.</div><div class="fanfic-line">One could tell from the pantyshots alone that it was directed by Obhari.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda dangled by the ropes after hitting her angle of repose. She wheezed pitifully as her body screamed at her, her muscles raw from a single blow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her abdominal region was completely black and blue, taking the brunt of whatever hit her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even thinking about standing up only hurt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just then, a figure emerged from the endless flood of the spotlight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella appeared, dressed in a formfitting, but relatively modest swimsuit, something you’d see from a Japanese high school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was close enough to a unitard, and it only accentuated her belladonna hips as she stepped toward her downed opponent.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The crowd roared for blood as Stella’s dainty footsteps tapped the mat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda could only look up to her opponent. Once again, her soft smile and folded hands reflected nothing but sweet innocence.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Masami Obhari is known for the trend of banana-boat faces as seen in 90’s anime. This style proliferated mainly because of how often he directed OVAs for various fighting games.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ghhk.” Reeda winced, but tried to pull herself up by the ropes. “Not cool, bro. H-how did you get so damn strong?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">But Stella kept talking: “By his twenties he directed several anime and licensed OVAs. He was also involved in various futanari projects.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“If Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer is anything to go by, some say he burnt himself out with pantyshots and TNA. Who are we to say that, though? He worked since he was nineteen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What will you do by that age, Reeda?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda opened her mouth to reply, but Stella clamped onto the top rope and swung forward. Her legs gracefully slid between the rope and around Reeda’s head before a wall of muff slammed right into her face like a battering ram.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda’s tail thumped against the mat. It twitched and writhed with pleasure as the stegosaur clamped herself around Reeda’s head once again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The faceless mass in the darkness cheered and laughed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thunk!</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda awoke in the back of her van.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Back on planet earth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She felt something warm between her fingers, and found they slid down the front of her panties, which were soaked and warm.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck! I’m having wet dreams as an adult? Does that even happen? What’s wrong with me? Reeda thought.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another metallic thunk sounded, and her van rocked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fuck off! This is my shitbox van! Go rob someone else!” Reeda raged and pounded the wall of her van until a cluster of footsteps and giggles bolted away into the night.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She started the AC. The humidity ran her ragged and the involuntary orgasm left her filling the back with water bottles.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She stared at the laundry bag in the back corner. She tied it after the musk of sex wouldn’t air out. She could still feel the soaked garments in general, as if they stared at her constantly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">When Stella smothered her out on that first visit, it took all the weight off her. Her body flushed with pleasure and that high of her scent left her helpless, open, ready for anything in ways not even carfe’d measure up to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">But afterward, they spent the rest of the weekend just binging anime and talking. Stella didn’t bring it up. Neither did she.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Am I going crazy? She thought. I know that shit fucking happened. A bro-ess doesn’t forget the plush heft of an herbivore’s legs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was something about that anime, especially shonen that got her on, she suspected. Something about seeing effeminate dudes groaning helplessly as an overcostumed villain makes an example of them…</div><div class="fanfic-line">She found her mind drifting into lust again, and snapped herself out of it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Was Stella okay? Her face was unreadable, and she thought she was good with that intuition stuff.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Was the nerd so overwhelmed she did all that… because she thought I wanted her to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">D-did I force her to do that?</div><div class="fanfic-line">A sigh rattled out of Reeda’s throat and a pit of worry tore through her heart.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She decided to escape the sex-reeked van and sit outside to stare to the stars.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Do I have another addiction to worry about, or is life just like this?” she said aloud to herself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another school week passed. Reeda found herself standing tall again, glowing, and cracking jokes. She managed to misdirect the other violently pink student, Naomi, until a herd of idiots smoking in the bathroom were able to flee from a first floor window.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was a force of habit to help punks in need, and flustering Naomi with japery was fun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Band practice came and went as well. Same old. Same old. She enjoyed getting into sync with her friends, but Trish was a wall against any of her new lyrics:</div><div class="fanfic-line">“’Megazord blastodon with a stain on his shirt’?” the blueberry triceratops grunted. “That doesn’t even mean anything.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“But the Hitler bicycle stuff was okay? I’m not grockin’ it?” Reeda asked, genuinely confused, but with a leveled tone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another argument fizzled out. A three voter system doesn’t work if their frontliner was busy cuddling her new boyfriend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, who was she kidding? Fang and Anon were awesome together.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Band practice went later into the night as usual. Of course, Reeda found herself moving the lighting equipment and cables back to the supply closet. She’d even been messing with lenses she snagged from photography class to try out some trippier effects.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She took the long way around the school, making sure none of the art nerds catch her with their ‘paralegally-aquired’ equipment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">A light blue washed over the sky that evening. The sun refused to set so easily as Reeda passed by the tall fence surrounding the school’s swimming pool. Her eyes glued themselves to the shimmers of light playing off the rippling water.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She suddenly stopped. She thought the pool was closed around this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Someone rose from the water, her figure shapely and as sleek as porcelain.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was Stella! She was wearing that same swimsuit as… that dream.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The black onesie only drew more attention to her lime green arms… and legs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Reeda. Y-you’re staring again.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda jilted, partly for being caught peeping, and partly from realizing this wasn’t another dream.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Sorry, bro! I didn’t mean to… mmhmm.” Reeda bit down on her lip. She was so hot it was like steam billowed from her mouth in the form of dumb words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I didn’t mean to… fluster you.” Stella said. Her eyes drifted. Her arms clasped to her chest, as if offering a prayer to for the beet red raptor: may Raptor Jesus find it in his heart to cure this junkie, one of his own kin, of his post-addiction sensory floods.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No! I mean- No way, brosefina. I didn’t mean to bug you. It’s just, I didn’t know you did swim team.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Play it cool, Reeda. Just be chill.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I don’t. I um, snuck in.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Sweet.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I can access some of the water works from the pipes around here, so I got a spare key. Rosa knows more about that stuff.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You’re really abusing your power, throwing that weight around.” Reeda chuckled, casting a smirk and a sharp flick of her legendary eyelashes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella squeaked and floundered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hook, line, and sinker.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Don’t tell anyone!” she peeped desperately.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda gently rested the box of equipment on the ground.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“On one condition.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What’s that?” Stella asked, but immediately realized what when the raptor tore off her shirt, revealing a lean bubblegum-colored body and black sports bra.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The two screamed and hollered with as the pool’s chill was the perfect antidote for the suffocating, humid heat. It was true Stella wasn’t a sport swimmer, because Reeda beat her in every set they could remember: frontstroke, backstroke, jellyfishes, etc…</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of course, Reeda was more interested in the high dive.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Steeling herself, she took a running start before springing into the air. The world whirled around her axis as she stayed pencil straight, but pulled off a frontflip twister.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella’s dazzled claps from the waters below made her heart swell.</div><div class="fanfic-line">With the rest of her fall to spare, she tucked herself tight and quickly managed a somersault. Once completed, her limbs shot back out for stylish flair, and to shoot Stella some finger gun-</div><div class="fanfic-line">SMACK!</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella shrieked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The pink pistol of a raptor, the math whiz she was, let saurian error miscalculate her little trick, and she belly flopped into the water like a bag of wet cement falling from a skyline.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda coughed up water. Her vision refocused yet again. It felt so familiar: all the muscles on her front side tenderized to hell and her head resting on Stella’s well-cushioned lap.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before she could contemplate shutting her eyes again, and taking advantage of the moment, a gruff voice and Stella’s trembling shocked her into panic mode.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“There’s a reason why this isn’t public access. Without a lifeguard, you stupid brats’ll hurt yourselves!</div><div class="fanfic-line">How’d you break in, anyhow?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda felt Stella’s body shake from the question. She managed to peel herself up and stare seriously at the round pterosaur security guard, who replied by shining his flashlight directly into her eyes. He wore a shocked grimace and wouldn’t even look at her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What gives? No need to blind me, bud. I picked the lock, okay?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You picked it? You little delinquent.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Au contraire. It’s a useful skill. Easy and cheap to pick up, too. Remember this the next time you lock yourself out of your car.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">The chubby ptero grunted with annoyance, obviously too impatient for a lecture on vocational skills.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Just get out of here before someone sees you. And… get your garment.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Garment?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda noticed a strip of black floating daintily across the water. She then looked down to a pair of bare mounds on her chest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella quickly threw the tarp back over her shoulders.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I. I. I. Uh… I-” Reeda stammered. Her brain overheated and her eyes shrank into minuscule pinpricks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I put that tarp over you for a reason.” Stella muttered, her cheeks flushed from secondhand embarrassment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m usually much cooler than this, I swear.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella joined Reeda in the back of her van. The pink raptor, thoroughly humiliated in both dreamland and the waking world, only allowed her snout to push out from the blanket of tarp.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The security guard claimed they should just keep it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It was a great jump until the end. The high dive is too scary for me, anyways.” Stella replied sweetly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You make me wanna melt~.” Reeda blurted, her words sliding out with the verbal fidelity of Elmer Fudd.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella gasped, then clutched her lap.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda couldn’t help but peer out from her idiot bag, at least to see the results of her Anon-tier pickup line.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The green stego’s tail thumped hard enough to rock the entire van. Her hands wrung the hem of her t-shirt. Her eyes stared contemplatively through the front windshield, the moon illuminating those  aquamarine eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda wanted to tear her heart out and give it to the green sweetie as recompense for flustering her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I- I’m sorry. I’m not this frisky, I swear.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">There I go, she thought, making excuses again…</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m sorry for abusing you.” Stella whimpered, than rested her head against her knees until her tail coiled over to guard her face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda could still hear her sniffles. Her eyes widened with confusion, and she emerged from the tarp dressed in only a soaking bra and jeans.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You. Abuse me?” she said, failing to restrain a chuckle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella’s tail parted from her face just enough to cast a stern glare from her welling eyes. “You were practically my seat. I still have claw marks on my… butt… because of how frenzied you got.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I…” Reeda chuckled again. “I can’t argue there. I told you, I’m getting over some problems-.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You can’t blame everything on the carfe!” Stella rebuked sharply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“No! You don’t get it. You’re chill.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“What?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You’re actually chill. There’s no edge to you. Not like me. I-I only pretend to be cool, but I've hurt my friends for so long, and I've hurt you too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Stella, I love watching shows with you. It puts me at a peace I never knew before. Why do I deserve it? I-I’m just a crusty dudette living out of her van. I didn’t mean to overwhelm you with my…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Burst of lust.” Stella replied. Her expression softened, and she shot a grin to Reeda. “I wish I was you. You seem to know yourself really well. You know what to say and you travel around, just picking up whatever you can from the world. I- I wish I could do that.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“That… and… um…” she trailed off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Stella. You’re mumbling.” Reeda said. She had an idea of what she would say just from the look on her face… and the nosebleed, but she wanted to hear it to be sure, still unsure about trusting her own senses.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You’re strong and hot.” Stella peeped.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I know that.” Reeda lounged on her shoulder, showing off her chest and flexing bicep. Her eyelashes flicked sensually again, tickling Stella pink.</div><div class="fanfic-line">They both chuckled, and Stella climbed onto her mop-topped raptor. She planted her butt firmly on her lap again, and gently adjusted her tush, letting her cheeks pancake out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The look on Reed’s face was priceless. Her eyes were fluttering.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m really not that innocent.” Stella said. “I- I have trouble expressing myself, especially with sex, but that’s why I live through anime. I put my energy into that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“That’s why I can dom you so hard.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">She issued that like a challenge.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without a word and despite her aches, Reeda rose. Stella tried to pin her down by the hands, but a nudge from her forearms were enough to overcome the weeb.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“So, you’re secretly a horny little monster. And I thought you just had weird tastes.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">As Stella’s back pressed against a wrinkled, chlorine reeking tarp on the floor of the van, Reeda easily squatted over her. Her tail, while not as massive as Stella’s, was fit as a whip.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It gently slid up the crotch of Stella’s jeans. The blend of creamy smooth scales and downy feathers made her tremble as she quickly undid her zipper, letting Reeda closer to her sex.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda simply stared at Stella as her face contorted. The mask of innocence gone, or at least the mask she thought she wore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Raptor Jesus. You got me back then, but look at you. I don’t even have to touch you to make you squirm.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella couldn’t respond. She couldn’t even moan as her entire body buzzed from the gentle slithering of her bropadre’s tail.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her mouth shifted between clenching tight to open-mouthed bliss. She didn’t thrash nearly as much as Reeda did, but she heaved gently.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda couldn’t stand it anymore. She pressed her palm to Stella’s and with her free hand, simply felt her contours: the firm plated scales, the smooth flab of belly-skin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her ripe lime titties.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella clenched, her body unused to the gentle touch, and she accidentally kicked the back seat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda nodded attentively and tried to ease off, but Stella grabbed her wrist and pulled it back to her breast.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The raptor explored the tactile grace of Stella’s body, letting her hand glide over her like fresh butter on toast.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She bit her lip so hard she drew blood. She trembled, almost loving the easy, soothing touches more that sex itself, but just then, something tugged at the front of her jeans.</div><div class="fanfic-line">With pinpoint accuracy, the weeb hooked her hand right into the crotch of Reeda’s pants, and brushed the lips of her bare cunt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The big dom dino shuddered and she bucked so hard she lost balance and tumbled onto Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The van rocked so hard that night it set the alarm off twice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">After numerous complaints, a squad car rolled up around five a.m.</div><div class="fanfic-line">One of the officers looked through the front window, only to find a pair of full moons as the bare-bodied dinos watched a show from Stella’s phone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Woooah bro. Where’s the robbery?” Reeda asked coolly, letting her tail drape over the both of them to provide some cover.</div>
