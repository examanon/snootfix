I hate being the one who has to lock up. Especially on Fridays. Not only do I have to stay the longest while everyone else gets to leave, but I also miss out on precious minutes of the day. With a brisk pace, I walk to my car, throw my stuff and myself inside, and turn the ignition. The vehicle peels out of the parking lot and onto the street. Mercifully traffic isn't too bad today, so hopefully, I'll be home soon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fridays are very special to me since Fang and I always reserved them as 'us' time. It started back when we were still in high school. At first, it would be to study or watch the band practice. Later on, it turned into dates and hanging out in Fangs' room when her dad wasn't home. Sometimes it was even dinner and a show. The food was usually either dino nuggies or Moe's Meateor lovers pizza. The show was Fang playing whichever song she was working on or teaching me how to play something simple on the guitar. The college years were the worst since the only way we could hang out was by either voice or video chat. Thankfully Fang had an unlimited data plan and was always eager to call.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Pulling into the driveway I can already smell something delicious cooking. There was no doubt Fang wasn't a star cook, but her mom was. Samantha leaped at the opportunity to teach her baby girl how to properly prepare food. 'The way into a man's heart is through his stomach' she always said. Fang didn't need that to steal my heart, though it was still nice having some varied meals. Even the best pasta and nuggets get old after a while, and takeout has its own problems. Approaching the door, the smell gets stronger and I can hear a song playing. I step inside, the entire house smelling of something delicious. It was summer, and with school out, Fang had more time to make something extra special. I enter the kitchen to greet my ptero wife. She's busy behind the stove and doesn't notice me enter. Fang is wearing a black t-shirt with a logo from one of her favorite bands, most of the backside missing to make space for her wings. She has the same type of black jeans as she wore during high school, just not completely torn up. To top it off she's wearing, an admittedly cute, pink apron. No doubt a gift from her mom. While the sight might seem odd at first glance, it's nothing compared to the song that is currently playing from Fangs' phone. It's something I thought Fang wouldn't be caught dead listening to, yet here she was, singing and humming along.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang was using a wooden spoon to mix whichever soup she was making and rapidly wagging her tail to the song's frantic rhythm. She finishes tasting her dish just as the final chorus of the song kicks in. Using the wooden spoon as an impromptu microphone she sings the chorus, completely lost in the song.</div><div class="fanfic-line">♪Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling♫</div><div class="fanfic-line">♫And every time we kiss, I swear I can fly♪</div><div class="fanfic-line">♪Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last♫</div><div class="fanfic-line">♫I need you by my side♪</div><div class="fanfic-line">With the song over she finally notices me standing at the doorway to the kitchen. I really don't want to laugh. Seeing Fang sing such a cheesy love song while wearing a pink apron is both incredibly cute, but also incredibly hilarious. Her face can't decide whether to turn pale or bright red and keeps switching between the two.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"H-hi Anon, did you just come home from work?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I've been here for a bit"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So you..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, you better not fucking tell anybody!" Fang turns away to hide just how red her face had gotten. "Like there's anything wrong with singing a love song if you're in love."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I put down my stuff and approach her from behind. Before she can turn around I hug her from behind and place my head on her shoulder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I thought you sounded great. Who's the lucky guy though?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang lets out a sigh, "You're such a dweeb." She rests her head against one of my arms and I can feel her tail struggle to wag while I'm pressed against her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So, what are you making?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Just something from my moms' cookbook. Can't believe she let me borrow the thing." Fang takes the wooden spoon and grabs a bit of the soup she's making.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Want a taste?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sure"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang slowly moves the spoon towards my mouth, "Just be careful, it's hot. You don't want to burn your mouth if you know what's good for you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">I give it a quick blow before tasting, "Wow, this is really good. Your mom would be proud."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mmhmm. Can you go set the table? I'm almost finished and I bet you're starving."</div><div class="fanfic-line">I lift up my head from Fangs' shoulders, but my hands go from around her waist, to her hips, and all the way along her tail. As my hands reached her tail Fang tenses up and releases a quick shiver along with a stifled moan as my hands lightly brush her stubby appendage.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You just can't wait, huh? I didn't cook all of this just so it would get cold. Dinner first."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I set the table and Fang soon after serves the food. It's honestly really good. Admittedly, being made by my ptero wife made me biased. We chat about our day and before long the meal is finished, I even went back for seconds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">As we're taking care of the dished Fang can't resist asking again, "Well? Did you like it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course, why wouldn't I?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang continued, remarkably sheepish, "You're just saying that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No, I'm not. Remember the first thing you ever cooked? I made my feelings clear about that one."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"The world just wasn't ready for pizzas with a dino nugget stuffed crust."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Neither was /ck/. Hopefully, that video never goes viral or Fang is going to kill me. As I'm finishing up Fang goes to the couch and picks up her old guitar that was resting next to it. I join her soon after. Even with her hands busy, she wordlessly extends her wing as an invitation. Settling in, Fang starts playing a variation of our song. My belly full, a soft wing as a blanket, and a lullaby playing I can do little to prevent my eyes from getting heavy. Adjusting myself a little bit, using Fangs' shoulder as an impromptu pillow I make myself comfortable. Just five minutes, I'm sure the love of my life wouldn't mind if I doze off for a bit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After a while, Fang notices Anon starting to lightly snore. She stops playing and, with the utmost care to not disturb Anons' sleep, gently places the guitar on the side of the couch. Fang reaches for a blanket prepared for just such an occasion. She drapes it over both of them and leans her body against Anon. Putting her other wing and both arms around anon, she completes her hug with a light peck on Anons' head. Her voice barely a whisper, Fang lets out an 'I love you' before also closing her eyes.</div>
