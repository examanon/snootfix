Anon was hung over the couch. An entire case of beer was gone. He couldn’t feel anything. Nothing but a dark empty pit of self-loathing and disgust. For two weeks it has been like this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Two weeks since she’s been in that hospital. Two weeks since the accident happened. Her wings… her poor little broken wings. Why didn’t he see it coming? Why couldn’t he have been there to stop her? What kind of father was he? It was supposed to be a simple father and daughter day out together. One moment he looked away, just to buy her one of those little dragon plushies she was fawning over. Next was Naser, coming out from the store across the street and calling out to his little niece. And Amber ran across a busy street just to give her uncle a hug.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No one could have predicted what came next. By the grace of whatever god was out there, however, that she had survived. But he failed her… he knew he failed her. He couldn’t even share the same bed with Fang, having failed her as a husband atop of that. Fang couldn’t sleep herself either. She was up all night crying. Anon wanted her to hate him, scream at him, tell him how it was all his fault. Instead, she just held onto him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Not you… not you too… oh Anon don’t do this to yourself please…” she whispered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Two weeks she had been looking in a mirror of the past. A mirror of her own pain and regret. Which was exactly what he didn’t want. He’s already ruined one precious thing in his life. Now he’s ruined Fang by proxy. He didn’t want to be empathized. He wanted to be punished.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nightmares plagued him every night. The image of Amber running out in the road, and the car careening to the side to try and avoid her, and sending her little body several feet across the road. Again and again and again it played out in his dream. Time slowed to a halt by the end of each tragedy. Then he’d wake up, 4 AM with a cold sweat.</div>
