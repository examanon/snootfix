Rosa's was arguable the most impressive, a hand made quilt that had little anons and little fangs all over it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The hours passed by like minutes as we all gathered to chat and eat whatever was left of the cake.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eventually came the time for everyone to head they're own separate ways until it was just me and my beloved fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang:"So how was it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon:"How was what?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang:"you're birthday party dummy"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon:"Oh! it was great!I hadn't had that much fun a while ever since we bought this house."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang:"you knoow~   i still havent given you your birthday present" her words carrying an enamorous tone to it</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon:"oh?" i curiously say as i pull fang closer to me</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang giggles, then pushes me away, taking my hand and gently placing it on her stomach, we both lock on to each others eyes knowing full well of what it meant.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon:"Fang......" the words leave me as ive been struck by a train</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang:"Happy birthday anon...this is my gift to you, our own little bundle of joy"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In that moment i felt nothing but Happiness and attachment to fang,i pulled her in, embracing her, relishing and savoring the moment, wishing time would halt to a complete stop.Tears of joy rolling down each others cheek, we we're finally going to start the loving family we've dreamed about all this time, and what better way to do it with the person who i so very dearly love.</div>
