                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Battle Of The Bands</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Completed</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang, Naser, Ripley, Samantha, Trish, Reed</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Anonymous</div><div class="fanfic-line">Summary: Vvurm Dramas second concert</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">School is over and the Fang gang can finally relax for a few months before college begins. At least that's what I had hoped would happen. Instead, Trish had managed to convince both Fang and Reed to have another concert. Fang wanted to just have another concert at Moe's, while Trish was looking for something grander. Reed in his typical carefree fashion was OK with whatever venue the girls decided to pick. While the girls were arguing about the optimal venue size I decided to gamble a little bit. Without telling any of them, I sent footage of the bands' concert at Moe's to the upcoming Volcaldera battle of the bands event organizer. I didn't want to get the trios' hopes up, only for them to be rejected. The organizer must have been impressed by the bands' performance because only a few days later I got an e-mail stating that Vvurm Drama is now an official participant. I call up Fang to set up a band meeting.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey, sweet tooth, what are you up to?" A groan is heard before I get a reply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We're about to head out again, hopefully, this time we'll finally settle on a place."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You guys should put that on hold. I have some news." There are a few seconds of silence before Fang speaks up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, what is it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh no, I'm only telling you guys in person." I can hear the trio talking in the background for a few moments.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright, we'll come to pick you up. It better be good news though."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Half an hour later, Reeds' van pulls up to the curb near my apartment. I quickly clamber inside before the locals do anything stupid. All of them try to get me to spill my guts, but it proves fruitless. I'm only telling them when we get to the nearby bar. Mostly so we can celebrate, but also so I have witnesses if Fang or Trish decide they do not appreciate me going behind their backs. We walk inside and sit behind the cleanest table booth. The Vvurm Drama members are starting to get impatient, but I assure them it will be worth it, we just have to wait for our drinks. Finally, the waitress brings us our order, a few minutes longer and Fang would have wrung the secret out of me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright, don't be mad, but I sent footage of your concert at Moe's to the Volcaldera battle of the bands organizer" The trio is not particularly thrilled at first until they realized I wouldn't have dragged them here if I had bad news. Trish is the first to speak up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What did they say? They liked us but had no slots left? That we had potential? Come on, spit it out already!" I chuckle for just a moment to draw out the suspense.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You got accepted, the event is next month." They stare at me for a second before realization sets in. Reed and Trish are happy as can be, while Fang pulls me in for a hug.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Can't say I appreciate you going behind our backs, but I'll make an exception this time."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We finish our drinks and order another round to celebrate. The initial excitement wears down and the band begins discussing their plans. Reed is the first one to speak up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We better start practicing though, don't want to be the worst band of the bunch." Trish also gives her thoughts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We need somewhere we can practice in peace. Preferably a single spot so we don't have to lug our gear around too much and waste time."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'll talk to my parents. Pretty sure I can convince them to let us use the garage." I give Fang a skeptical look.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And how exactly are you going to convince your dad to let the band practice at your place for a month?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That's easy. I'll talk to mom and mom will talk to dad. Dad will have to move the car out of the garage because I'll let mom take plenty of pictures of us practicing." The rest of us can't help but laugh at the thought of tiny Samantha bossing Ripley around. Reed has a single request though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Just tell her to turn off the flash on her camera. I don't want to be blind by the end of the month."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The next day I take the bus to the Aaron residence. When I arrive I already see Trish and Reed moving their gear into the now empty garage. Fangs' mom must have immediately put the squeeze on Ripley. Soon the band begins their first practice session. A few hours in Fang calls for a proper break. Everyone is exhausted and her voice is starting to become strained. The ptero asks Trish to come with her while Reed and I just chill.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How are you holding up man, nervous like the girls?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nah bro, as long as I got this," he shakes his ever-present thermos, "I'm cool as a cucumber." After taking a sip from it the pink raptor continues. "We really need a lot of practice though. Doing well would mean a lot to the girls, especially Fang." He stops to take another sip, "I won't lie and say I don't hope we win, but even placing high would be an achievement."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, the girls probably think the same. Speaking off, I'll go check on them, they've been a while."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't have to go far to find the two ladies, Fang is leaning against Reeds' van talking to Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"-say, Trish? Please?" I didn't hear whatever it was Fang asked the purple triceratops, but it must have been important. Trish just stares at Fang for several seconds before suddenly hugging her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course, how could I say no?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish is acting uncharacteristically emotional, hopefully, it isn't anything bad. Fang seems both relieved and a little taken aback at Trishs' reaction. I clear my throat to let the girls be aware they're not alone anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry to interrupt, everything OK over here?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish quickly lets go of Fang and does her best to appear nonchalant.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah, everything is fine. Just some girl talk is all." Fang starts making her way back into the garage.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, break time is over, back to practice."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Vvurm Drama goes through all the original songs they've ever played, picking and choosing which ones would make the best impression on the crowd. Some are dismissed, some require changes to the lyrics. Reed writes down which songs require further polish and takes some suggestions from all of us. It's gotten late and I have bid farewell to the trio or I'll miss the last bus.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Morning comes and I do my usual routine. Face-plant the ground, shovel cereal into my mouth, and go to the bus stop. By the time I arrive at Fangs' place, the band is already practicing. Reed has made some lyrical improvements and the band as a whole is ever so slightly better. A good while later Trish calls for a break.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I know we have a lot of work to do, but I can't even hear Fang singing over my stomach growling." Everyone quickly comes to the same conclusion as the diminutive triceratops. We barely start talking about what to get when Naser appears at the garage entrance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I heard you guys were hungry, so I ordered some pizzas from Moe's. My treat." He looks at me before continuing, "We just have to go pick them up. Anon will help me with that while the rest of you take a breather."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I barely manage to take my seat before Naser hits the gas and the NasCar peels out of the driveway. We arrive at Moe's in record time, although at the cost of me losing several hours of life expectancy thanks to Nasers' reckless driving.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright Anon, I'll wait out here in the car while you go get the pizzas. Don't worry, they're already paid for." With payment already taken care off I'm in and out of Moe's in a flash. It doesn't take long before we're on our way back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Thanks for signing up the band for the event, Anon. I know you didn't tell them from the start to spare their feelings if they didn't make the cut."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No problem, I guess. Besides, they're doing all the work."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Exactly. That's why I was thinking you and I do our best to help them with whatever they need so they can just focus on practicing."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh, sure. Although, I was kinda hoping to watch them practice and give feedback."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Remember how happy Fang was when people cheered for the band at Moe's and for her at prom?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course, but what does tha-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Remember how hard she practiced for prom? She's going to practice ten times harder for this. We need to do everything we can to ease her burden. Helping Vvurm Drama win the contest would mean the world to her."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, you're right. Sure, I'll help with anything she needs of me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The moment we're spotted pulling into the driveway the band drops their instruments and makes their way towards us. Their desire for greasy pizza far outweighing everything else. The NasCar is ransacked before I even unfasten my seat belt. The only survivor is a lone box of meateor lovers pizza. I make my way to the empty spot Fang is tapping, pizza in hand. The ptero has a wide grin on her face. Whether it's because she's happy to see me or the extra pizza I'm not sure. Fang has somehow managed to devour three-quarters of hers already.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">How she manages to stay so thin is a mystery.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I already told you Anon, doctors said I won the genetic jackpot."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh god, how much did I mumble?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Pretty much everything. I'm much happier to see you than the pizza if you really must know." I take a seat next to Fang and open up the box. With the help of my ptero girlfriend, we cut the poor pizzas' life extra short. Its sacrifice will be remembered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You know, Naser and I were talking. Agreed we'd do errand runs and stuff like that so you guys could just focus on practicing."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That's so sweet of you Anon. I'll make sure to make it up to you, just after the concert, OK?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang gives me a quick hug and a peck on the cheek before she picks up her guitar and the band restarts their practice session. I stay with them for a few more hours before I have to take my leave and head for the bus stop.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I spend the next few weeks as being Vvurm Dramas support staff. I watch them play as much as I can, but a lot of time is spent doing various tasks to make their lives easier. Be it getting them food, various bits from the music store, picking up the new T-shirts Trish designed for the band, bringing the band merchandise to the venue a few days before the event, and so on. The day before the event is here. I arrive bright and early at the Aaron residence, but like always, the band is already there. The long hours spent practicing are really showing. The lyrics flow smoothly and the band members are in sync like a well-oiled machine. I've listened to them for so long I know all the lyrics by heart. My reverie is interrupted by a bright flash. While Samantha remembered to turn off the miniature sun that resides in her camera on most days, this wasn't one of them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sorry dears," she giggles for a bit before continuing, "Just letting you know dinner will be ready in about an hour, so don't stuff yourselves with junk food." The ptero matriarch leaves and the rest of the bands decide to take a quick break.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I make my way towards the group before a gigantic clawed hand stops me in my tracks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Boy, a quick word."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm shepherded towards Ripley's car, too focused on not shitting myself to object to the abduction. I take the front passengers seat and wait. Moments later Ripley gets into the driver seat, the car lurching as the patriarch sits behind the wheel. My imagination is running wild with possibilities. Did I do something to piss off Ripley? Is he going to snap my neck and dump my body into the sea? Not like I had any alone time with Fang for the last month so hopefully, that isn't it. Ripley clears his throat to get my attention. His voice is neutral, so I can't gauge just how much trouble I'm in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm still not a hundred percent sold on you, boy. But I have to admit you've had a profound effect on Lucy in the few months you two have known each other."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ripley lets out a long sigh and is silent for a few moments. I decide to stay silent and hope he eventually continues.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I was worried we were close to losing her," a low chucked escapes him, "But apparently all she needed was someone like you in her life."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The car comes to a stop in an empty street, not a single soul in sight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm thankful for all that you've done for her boy. It's obvious to even an old fossil like me how she feels about you." The patriarch puts his oversized hand on my shoulder and gives me a stern look that freezes my blood.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"If you break her heart or if I find even a single feather out of place on my little angel..." The grip on my shoulder tightens enough to make me wince.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...I'll make sure you regret being born. Understand?" I can barely manage to nod my affirmation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Good. Don't take it as a threat, take it as a promise."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We spend the ride back to the Aaron residence in silence. The feeling in my left arm returned after a couple of minutes, hopefully, no permanent damage. The car comes to a stop and I see Samantha ushering the musical trio into the house. Dinner was ready and she would not allow it to get cold because the band wanted to keep practicing. Before I even close the car door Fangs' mom is already next to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Do you want to have dinner with us Anon? I made plenty." Ripley replies in my stead and his voice makes it clear there will be no arguing.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course the boy will join. He's earned it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The matter settled without my input, I make my way inside the house. Ripley takes his seat at the head of the table and I take the one Fang has been saving for me. Do pterodactyls have telepathy? Doesn't matter, the food smells great and I'll finally be able to spend some time with my ptero girlfriend that isn't band practice. Dinner goes smoothly, Ripley not looking at me with murderous intent if I so much as touch his daughter greatly contributing to the good mood. I had so much fun I forgot what time it was and missed the last bus. Thankfully Naser volunteered to drive me to my apartment and even pick me up tomorrow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Judgment day has arrived. I barely got any sleep, spent most of the night tossing and turning, thinking about how the band would perform. I wasn't even the one that would be on stage. I can only imagine what the trio is going through. The hours feel like days before I get a text from Naser saying he's coming to pick me up. The NasCar comes to my apartment and doesn't come to a complete halt. Instead, I have to run next to it and jump inside. Naser is taking no chances in this shitty neighborhood. I finally manage to get properly seated and put my seatbelt on. Just in time too, as Naser once again puts the pedal to the metal and we're almost launched into the air as the NasCar goes over a small hill.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What should be a half-hour drive, takes a little over ten minutes. Thank god I don't have hair or they'd start going gray, maybe that's why Fangs' hair is the color it is. Even this early, a crowd is already forming. We make our way backstage to where the gang is waiting. We quickly spot Reeds' clunker of a van and the musical trio are all there. Reed is sitting in the back of the van, fiddling with some of the bands' equipment. Trish is leaning against the side of the vehicle, eyes closed in thought. Fang is pacing to and fro, already wearing a groove into the patchy grass.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The moment our eyes meet, she slightly relaxes. The surroundings fade away and we can't help but go to each other. When I get close enough I take her hands in mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How are you holding up?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Excited. Nervous. Terrified." I pull her into a hug to comfort her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You'll do great." We just stand there, embracing each other for a while until we're interrupted by Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright you two love birds, break it up. There'll be time for that after our show." She holds up two T-shirts with 'Vvurm Drama' printed in bold letters surrounded by a pair of bat wings.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Put these on, we need everyone to know our name."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The five of us put on the shirts over our regular clothes. The shirts are surprisingly comfortable, Trish didn't cheap out on the material choice. For a moment, everyone forgets about the concert and just jokes around. Even then Trish can't help herself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"When we make it big, these things will sell for thousands as memorabilia. How many do you want to buy Anon?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wonder if she has any rhinorex ancestors. We don't even notice the show had already started. The first band started playing and they don't sound half bad. Of course, everyone keeps repeating that while the guys on stage sound OK, they're not nearly as good as Vvurm Drama. After a while, the band ends, and the final cheer of the crowd is their score. The cheers are middling, even with a large crowd already in attendance. Time passes, more bands come and go and soon day turns into evening.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The latest band is finishing up, with Vvurm Drama being next in line. The members have psyched each other up and are itching to get on stage. The curtains on the stage falling are our cue. The previous band is scrambling to get their stuff off stage, while we're bringing ours on it. Naser and I bring on the heavy equipment, while Reed is setting up the lights on stage. Just as we put the last piece in place the announcer gives us our two-minute warning. I give Fang one last hug before getting off and joining the audience. There's got to be several thousand people there now. It's going to be a struggle making it to the front but I have to try. Vvurm drama starts playing and the crowd is making it known they like what they're hearing. I do my best to try and squeeze through the partying crowd and avoid getting an elbow to my face. I'm only partially successful on the latter. Fang has noticed me a couple of times in the crowd, but can't do more than slightly smile for a few seconds before returning her focus on the song.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've almost reached the front, one of the last hurdles being a hulking gray figure. I tried squeezing past him to no avail. The guy turns around, clearly upset. He gets into my face and starts shouting, partially in anger, partially so I can even hear him at all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey bro, what's your problem?!" Isn't this the guy Stella went to prom with?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm just trying to get to the front!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Maybe you should have come earlier!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on man, my girlfriend is playing!" His expression changes from angry to excited. I doubt he recognizes me from school, so hopefully, he's sympathizing with my current struggle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No way. Which one?!" he points a finger at Trish, "Is it the purple chick?!" I do my best to not shudder at the thought.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No! The other one! The ptero girl!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Whoa, you're one lucky guy! Go get to her then!" The shark guy gives me a thumbs up before lifting me over and in front of him. My triumph is short lived thank to two even larger dinos in front of me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The current song ends and Fang grabs the microphone. She is tired, sweaty, and completely in her element.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Thank you Volcaldera, you've been amazing!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The crowd starts cheering like all of them when a performer mentions the place they're at. The ptero does her best to catch her breath while waiting for the crowd to settle down again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Before we finish, we'd like to play one last song! This one is dedicated to a very special person in the crowd tonight!" Fang steels herself and takes a deep breath before continuing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I love you Anon!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The crowd once again erupts into cheers, while I'm standing there dazed from what just happened. I feel the same way about her, but I don't know if I'd have the courage to say it in front of such a large crowd. I look up at the stage and see Fang has begun to sing. Thankfully I'm close enough to the stage to hear her, if only just.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">♫40 days and 40 nights♪</div><div class="fanfic-line">♪I waited for a guy like you to come and save my life♫</div><div class="fanfic-line">♫All the days I waited for you♪</div><div class="fanfic-line">♪You know the ones who said I'd never find someone like you♫</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This isn't like any song I've ever heard the band play. Instead of their regular intense rock stuff, this one is softer, upbeat, and a little cheesy as far as the lyrics go. The important part is that it's Fang singing it, which makes it the greatest song I've ever heard. I'm snapped out of my trance when a massive gray hand grabs me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Bro, didn't you say that was your girlfriend!?" I can only nod, the whole ordeal has overwhelmed me so much I'm starting to choke up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why are you standing here like an idiot then?! Go to her!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The sharkman notices the obstacle in front of me. He pushes the two dinos apart just enough for me to slip through. He gives me a thumbs-up before letting go and the two living barricades slam back together. The first chorus has ended and Anon once again focuses on the song.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">♫From time to time I pinch myself♪</div><div class="fanfic-line">♪Because I think my guy mistakes me for somebody else♫</div><div class="fanfic-line">♫And every time he takes my hand♪</div><div class="fanfic-line">♪All the wonders that remain♫</div><div class="fanfic-line">♫Become a simple fact♪</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I turn around to my right, only to be greeted by the face of a familiar Ankylosaur.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"An-on, you finally made it!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, just barely! Didn't think you are into this kind of music!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm not, but when I heard my friends were playing I just had to come!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">When the second chorus ends, the lighting on stage changes from bright yellow to a softer blue. Significantly more impressive than the light change is what happened to Fang. Suddenly her body and wings are aglow with intricate blue patterns. I can only stare until I'm grabbed by someone yet again. This time the lucky grabber is Rosa.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why are you just standing here stupid?! Go!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before I can say anything I'm already launched up onto the stage. Thankfully the stage isn't very high up so I quickly recover from the Mexican launch. I pick myself up and look at Fang who has just finished the final chorus of the song. She stops singing, leaving Reed and Trish to pick up the final vocalizations of the song. Fang places the guitar on the floor and slowly makes her way to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Everything that isn't Fang fades into the background, the roar of the crowd only barely perceivable. When we finally reach each other Fang puts her arms around my shoulders.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Thank you for everything Anon. How can I ever repay you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Instead of saying anything stupid that would ruin this incredible moment, I just lean towards Fang and kiss her.
