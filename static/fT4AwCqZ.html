                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: The Birds And The Bees</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang, Amber</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: F4L</div><div class="fanfic-line">Summary: Kids say the darndest things.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Birds chirping, the aroma of freshly cut grass, a gentle breeze through the open window. The traditional hallmarks of spring signal the end of winter for another year. Behind the sink, a bald human is fervently scrubbing a cast iron pot. The occasionally muttered expletive at the expense of the burned-on rice can be heard if one was standing close enough.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Just leave it to soak," the human makes a mocking noise at the advice he's been given, "It's been soaking for two days, and it's still not coming off. This wouldn't have happened if it was pasta."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After several minutes of scraping, scrubbing, and swearing, the pot is finally clean. Or at least as clean as it could be given the circumstances. With the last dish finally taken care of, maybe the human can take a few minutes to relax. His hopes and dreams are dashed moments later when something, or rather someone, tugs at his trouser sleeve. A quick glance reveals it's none other than his precious daughter, looking up to him as she always does when she has some burning question to ask him. Debating who would win in a fight between Amber's latest choice of contestants was something that amused him to no end.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Dad, where did I come from?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon slowly puts away the washcloth while he processes what just happened. The day he has been dreading has finally arrived and much earlier than anticipated. How convenient Fang was out running errands on this fateful day. For a moment, Anon considered telling the truth. Honestly is the best policy, right? That is until Amber inevitably shares her newfound knowledge with her classmates. What could go wrong if an entire class of first graders is armed with accurate knowledge of reproduction? The other parents might even thank him for his service. A repeat of when Amber introduced all her classmates to the world of swearing. Anon still asserts his claim that it wasn't his fault. Although, he can't be one hundred percent certain she didn't overhear him after a rough match of Rock Ring 2. Bad enough, he got chewed up by the teachers and a few less than understanding parents. He also lost the bet he made with Fang. The prospect of her wearing her old high school outfit was just too hard to pass up, no matter how the odds were stacked against him. At least she was graceful in victory and didn't rub it in, and the date wasn't that bad, even if he had to dress up all fancy for it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Amber is still standing where she was moments before, eagerly awaiting an answer to her burning question. No bright idea has popped into his head yet, no matter how hard he's stalling. The human leans back against the counter and takes a deep breath, hoping a flash of inspiration hits him on the eleventh hour. Nope, nothing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"See, when a mommy and a daddy love each other very much, they, uh..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is it wrong to hope Amber suddenly develops ADD? Of course, it is. What the hell is he thinking?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...they, well, um..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The tiny ptero is unphased by her father's fumbling of words. He has her complete and undivided attention.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"When a mommy and a daddy love each other very much and want to have a baby, they call the..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Where the hell is going with this? Is he really gonna use the same goddamn cliche his father used on him on his own daughter?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"They call who, dad?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yes, yes, he is.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"The stork!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Amber's puzzled expression reveals this was not the answer she was expecting.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"The...stork?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Shit, shit, shit, this isn't the internet. He can't just pull the refuses to elaborate card. Why did it have to be him? This was supposed to be Fang's job.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, you see, they call the stork," the human takes a big gulp. Such an innocent question causes his nerves to fray like an old rope, "And if the stork sees they truly love each other and would be good parents, it brings them a baby."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He's as cool as a cucumber. As long as one ignores the beads of sweat rapidly forming on his forehead, shaky voice, and dried-out throat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Is there just one stork, or are there many storks?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Didn't he say he wasn't taking follow-up questions? Guess not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I think there are many storks?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What expert doesn't question his own theory from time to time? While Amber is, without a doubt, thinking of even more follow-up questions, Anon fills up a glass of ice-cold water. Maybe the water will go down the wrong pipe, cause him to start choking and free him of this interrogation by the tiny ptero.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Where do the storks get the babies?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What did he do to deserve this? Luckily he's bald. He would be now in any case, or at least his hair would have turned snow-white from the stress.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...stork trade secret."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Is that why I have a beak? Because I'm part stork?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Careful what you wish for. The water absolutely went down the wrong way, thanks to that question.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What?!" after almost passing out from the coughing fit, he continues, "No. It's because your mom has one too."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">While Amber is getting ready to deliver another hard-hitting question, Anon puts away the glass and places his hands on his knees. Today was supposed to be relaxing, yet he feels positively exhausted, and it's barely noon too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So you had to send the storks pictures of mom?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'She'd kill me if I sent pictures of her to anyone.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What was that, dad?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nothing!" even after all these years, his body still betrays him, "No, I didn't send the storks any pictures of her."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Then, how did they know to give me the same beak as mom has?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"They're very smart storks."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's over. Anon is well and truly at the end of his rope now. There's no more bullshit answer for him to pull after that one. He's been outplayed by his own daughter. He'd feel proud if it was about literally anything else. Someone call the medic because he's about to pass out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Dad?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The nightmare continues. Anon's voice is tired and barely above a whisper.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What is it, sweaty?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"If the mom and dad are different, do they have to call a special stork?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What do you mean by 'different'?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You're a human, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sure am."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To be honest, he wasn't sure of anything anymore, but hopefully, he got the answer right, all the same.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And mom's a pero-, a ptor-, a pthero-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"A pterodactyl."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yes! Thanks, dad."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe he does actually know something. Or Amber's giving him some easy pitches to build up his confidence before she goes for the killing blow again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm just asking because none of the kids at school have a human dad and dinosaur mom, and..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Whatever fatigue Anon was experiencing is suddenly gone. It was time to stop messing around and switch to serious business mode. He was dreading the day when something like this would inevitably happen. To think he thought he had at least until high school before the nature of his and Fang's marriage would cause Amber problems. The human gets down on one knee and puts his hands on his daughter's shoulders.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Are the kids at school giving you a hard time because you have a human dad?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Amber's gaze falls to the floor. Her voice becomes quieter and loses its characteristic cheery tone, "Sometimes..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How long has this been happening?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It started a few weeks ago..." Amber sniffs once before resuming her usual, brighter attitude, "It's OK now, though. It doesn't happen anymore."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon somehow doubts her classmates would drop the issue of their own volition, especially if Amber made it clear it upset her. Kid's can be incredibly cruel sometimes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Did you tell your teachers, or..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">His daughter's innocent laughter always made his day brighter, "Nope! I told mom."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang sure didn't feel like sharing anything regarding this incident with him. It's not like her to hide anything from him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And what did mom do?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"When she came to pick me up the next day, she told me to show her which kid was mean to me..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Go on, honey."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So I did, and she walked over to the kid's dad. I couldn't hear what he said, but mom started yelling at him."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I see."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's not like Amber to stop in the middle of a story. Anon can't remember the last time he had to tell her to continue.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Amber, what's wrong?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mom made me promise not to tell you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's OK, sweaty. I'll explain why you told me to mom. Now, what happened next?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Assured of being protected from her mother's wrath for breaking a promise she had made, Amber continues the story.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, I couldn't hear most of it, but whatever the kid's dad said made mom really mad. She said a bunch of nono words."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She did, did she?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Amber's voice becomes more excited with every passing moment as the little tike recalls the events, "She also punched him!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She did what?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah! It was so cool! She made him cry."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No wonder Fang didn't tell him anything about this. Amber still wasn't done, though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She also called him a little bitch."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Immediately after realizing she said a bad word, Amber quickly places her tiny hands over her mouth, cheeks flushed with embarrassment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's OK. You get a free pass," Anon does what could be considered a squint if one was being generous, "This time."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Thanks, dad."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You said this happened a few weeks ago, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh-huh."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That was around the same time when Amber swore in class which caused him to lose the bet and get in hot water at the PTA. He knew it wasn't his fault. Taking in the entire account causes him to completely miss the front door opening. In walks Fang carrying several groceries bags, none the wiser of what was discussed just moments ago. He was so absorbed in Amber's tale he didn't even hear the car pull up the driveway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hi, sweety! Hi, handsome," Fang's voice becomes ever so slightly husky, and she gives him a wink before returning to her default tone, "What are you two up to?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, we were just talking abo-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Dad was telling me where I came from!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe he should have made Amber promise to not tell Fang anything about their talk. He could have bought himself a few weeks at least. Fang is still preoccupied with putting away the groceries, seemingly ignoring what Amber said. The ever-widening smile on her face makes it obvious the older ptero is already imagining how the talk went.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And what did dad tell you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"He said you two called a stork to get me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A single snort escapes her before the Fang abandons putting away the groceries and scoops up the younger one in her arms.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Is that so?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">While Amber is distracted by her mother's tight embrace, the older ptero looks at Anon. She mouths 'A stork?' towards her husband, who can't respond in any other way besides shrugging in defeat. The taller of the pteros gives Anon a knowing look, informing him she'll get to the bottom of this sooner or later. For the moment, however, her attention returns to her offspring.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Do you want to know what my dad told me when I asked him the same question?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Amber nods enthusiastically, eager to hear what grandpa Ripley had to say on the matter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"He said I came from an egg! Can you believe that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A fraction of a second later, the two most important ladies in Anon's life erupt in boisterous laughter. Even he has a hard time keeping it together. An egg. Preposterous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mom?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What is it, honey?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"If it's not the stork, and it definitely isn't an egg, then where did I come from?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang lets out a long sigh. One is never ready to explain something like this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Tell you what, I promise to explain it to you when you're a few years older. Deal?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How much older?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang hesitates, for a moment, trying to work out the optimal time to give her daughter 'the talk' in her head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Let's say when you're eleven. Does that sound fair?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I guess..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Unlike Anon, Fang knows when it's time to try and distract Amber before she can come up with even more awkward questions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What do you say you spend some time practicing on the piano while dad and I finish putting away the groceries?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Can I play whatever I want?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang tries to hide her pained smile. She knows the cacophony that awaits them. For the moment, Amber should have fun playing the piano instead of adhering to strict rules and restrictions. What good is getting her to learn how to play if you make her hate it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yay!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A few minutes later, the house is filled with the sound of the piano. Most of the time, it's pure torture, but every so often, a few of the notes are strung together in such a way that comes across as remarkably pleasant. While their daughter takes artistic liberties with twinkle twinkle little star, the parental duo busy themselves by putting away the rest of the groceries. Instead of the usual chatter between the two that accompanies any chore they do together, it's substituted with silence. Only the occasional stifled snicker escapes Fang's mouth. Anon desperately tries to distract himself by staring intently at the fridge's contents. Hoping to figure out a way to stack all the things Fang bought in such a way that doesn't result in an expensive Jenga tower. His musings are cut short when his ptero wife brushes against him, reaching inside the fridge for a bottle of soda. With her prize secured, she lingers close to her husband, reducing her voice to a whisper so only he can hear.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Really, Anon? The stork?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of course, it sounds stupid when someone else says it. Doesn't stop Anon's cheeks and ears from turning bright red. Satisfied with Anon's response, the ptero pulls back and awaits her husband's next move with the biggest grin imaginable.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Look, she caught me off guard."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, kids tend to do that. The things some of them say in school. Pure insanity sometimes."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Speaking of things kids say. Amber shared a story about something that happened a few weeks ago."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh? What about?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang looks at Anon intently, waiting for him to continue. The occasional sips of cola through a straw tell him he's been silent for a while.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Something about a kid making fun of her for having a human parent."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The steady stream of cola froze in the straw. By the sound of it, it won't be a story about a weird dream or cool bug Amber saw. Taking her time to carefully put away the nearly empty bottle, Fang takes a deep breath before speaking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Right. That. Look, I took care of it. Frankly, I don't see what good it would do if I told you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Unless you want to know in excruciating detail the kind of words some random asshole used when referring to us. Because let me tell, some of it is pretty fucked up."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At this point, the ptero is talking more to herself. Fang has completely forgotten anyone is around her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Who the hell does the guy think he even is? Talking shit about someone he doesn't know anything about because it goes against his preconceived notions. What if I married and had a kid with a human? It's none of his business. The dumb asshole was lucky I didn't kick him in the balls so hard it sterilized him. At least it would ensure that little brat was the last one he ever fostered. The world would probably be better off, anyway."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Usually, these fucks aren't brave enough to say what they're thinking to my face. But when they do, they think I'll just stand there and take it. As if I'm afraid of them. Well, too bad, dipshit, you're gonna get your teeth knocked out. Just be happy the law prevents me from ripping out your throat. It's funny how they're all bluster and bravado until they get a faceful of knuckles, go down in a single punch, then cry to their momma. A bunch of little bitches is all they are... "</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fang..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The monologing ptero finally snaps out of her trance, realizing she's brought herself to the verge of tears by recalling the event. As she takes stock of her surroundings, she realizes Anon is holding her shoulders with a very concerned look on his face. Choking back on a sob, Fang pulls her husband into a tight hug with her arms and wings.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I...I just wanted to spare your feelings. Is that so wrong?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another sob, but this time there's no holding back the waterworks. The couple can only hope Amber's music will continue to drown out Fang's crying. All the human can do is slowly stroke her back while Fang lets it all out. After a few minutes, Fang's crying has subsided, and only the occasional sniffle can be heard to the tune of the Tetris theme, but half the notes are wrong.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm...I'm sorry, Anon. I know I should have told you. It's just..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Shhh, it's OK. You have nothing to apologize for."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang's grip around Anon's waist becomes slightly stronger, bringing the human into an even tighter embrace. Sniffling is replaced with content sighing as the human continues to stroke her back and hair.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You know, I do feel better now. So thanks for the therapy session," a low chuckle is shared between them, "You can't charge me, though."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I wouldn't dream of it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Thanks, dweeb."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anytime. Although..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang freezes, for a moment, before she pulls back far enough to look her husband in the eyes with a very concerned look on her face."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Although what?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You actually lost the bet."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A few seconds pass before Fang can figure out what Anon is talking about. When she finally does, the tension evaporates, and she can't help but laugh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah. I guess I did."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Resting her head on Anon's shoulder, Fang sighs, "Why do you care so much about that outfit anyway? You see me naked every day. Isn't that even better?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A minor emergency involving pasta leaking later, Anon manages to compose himself enough to actually give an answer. Who knew something like that could happen even after several years of marriage.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's the first thing I saw you in, making it special. It's hard to put into words."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright, fine..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wrapped in a winged cocoon courtesy of his ptero wife, Anon can't help but recall the time at Moe's when he was first introduced to the wonder that is wing hugs. The nuzzling makes the scene extra authentic.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You have to admit, you do look great in it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I already said I'll do it. No need to butter me up more."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And just imagine how hard you could kick someone's ass with those boots."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh my god."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No matter what, such moments between the two are always over too soon. As hard as it is to let go of each other, duty calls. The couple slowly pulls apart, despite neither really wanting to. Anon can't help but feel naked outside of his wife's winged embrace.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm gonna start getting dinner ready."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And I'm gonna check on Amber before she uses a wall for a canvas.
