I met a human named Anon a few weeks ago in """Science""" class, meaning it was while (((Mr. Fernsworth))) was spewing fucking ZOGBOT federal agent shit at us. Since I had nothing else to do at the time, I tried talking to him. He was a little squeamish (FUCKING CUTE) when he was talking to me, but he seemed keen on sticking around, so it interested me enough to strike up a nice conversation with him. For nearly an hour straight we talked about experimental weaponry with each other, and the sheer knowledge he has for this stuff? I'm not gonna lie, that shit is fucking HOT and it might be useful for if and when I take revenge on the IRS for spreading its satanic wrath upon the American people, but I digress. It ended very well considering how he promised to stay in touch with me. For a moment, it had me stop feeling like a FUCKING GHOST IN A WORLD NOT MEANT FOR ME. My eyes didn't feel baggy. I wasn't getting those intrusive thoughts. At that moment, I was in a state of bliss.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Throughout the past few weeks, we had started seeing each other more often. Whether it was through (((Mr. Fernsworth's))) acts against God or Mr. Tsuki's obnoxious weeaboo FAGGOT SHIT THAT CAN ONLY BE CURED WITH A PIPE BOMB, we found ourselves infatuated with each other whenever we were close by. The more I listened in, the more clearly I was allowed to view the world around me. Recently he's been more open on his interests and struggles, and it genuinely surprises me how much we have in common concerning the latter. We're both socially deprived, have a whopping zero idea what to do concerning the state of the world and what we'll do after graduation, and feel completely disconnected from the world around us. He seemed more open about it all after I had an anxiety attack with him right next to me about a week ago. I think it was then that our connection really clicked. Especially since, well, he hugged me to calm me down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No one's ever been there to give me physical comfort whenever this kind of thing happened. But when Anon pulled me in for a hug... it just sort of melted away, like the enemies of Christ when they witness his wrath-inducing holy fire. I practically had to stop myself from making out with him right then and there. I don't know what it was, but that heat in my chest didn't hurt like it usually did. It was a little cooler and spread throughout my body swimmingly. It was like an Angel sent from God had held my hand and told me everything was going to be okay, that there was no reason to be upset. Hell, it was almost like I lost the ability to feel negative emotion.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But if I find out he's just fucking with me, that he's holding ulterior motives. I will actually execute him in public. I will make EVERYONE watch as his jugular is stabbed right through like a fucking donut hole and RIP OUT HIS STILL BEATING HEART WITH BLOOD TRICKLING DOWN MY ARM. IF HE TURNS OUT TO BE A COCKROACH I WILL LITERALLY RIP HIM IN HALF.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Dear Diary</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's been close to 4 months since Anon and I met, and honestly? I wouldn't have traded it for a thing. I confessed my feelings for him, heart beating out of my chest, incoherent muttering taking up all my hearing, and he. Said. Yes! Ever since then, we've been having the time of our lives spending time with each other. And every time I see him, I instantly turn into jelly. I just fucking love him. I FUCKING LOVE HIM! His scent, his touch, his good and utter shit tastes, his empathy, all of it. It's all pretty much perfect with him. The cheesy romantic dates. The spooning and make-out sessions. The face he makes when I give a sultry growl~. The care he shows when I go on an inevitable rant when things feel shitty. It was somewhat rocky at first, considering he had been somewhat apathetic around everyone, but when I told him about my Schizophrenia, that awkward wall immediately crumbled into ashes. It was like a switch had flipped. We stopped holding the inner worries of our trust for one another. We knew exactly what to do when one of us was struggling. The voices don't stay around nearly as long as they used to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I think the moment our love and care for each other truly pierced through the mist was after that bitch TRISH fucking doxxed pictures of Anon's old self to the entirety of the senior student body. When I saw this and realized she had the gall to out him the way she did...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I broke.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even though the consequences of brutally beating down a fellow student were painfully obvious, it didn't matter to me. I sprinted after her faster than I've ever ran in the 18 years I'd lived up to that point. God, it was so loud. Static was raging throughout every inch of my head. My eyes were utterly bloodshot from me pushing down onto them in shocked rage. I almost couldn't breathe. There was nothing I could do except for one thing: KILL HER.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It started with a well-deserved sucker punch into her temple, forcing her into the green locker and making her collapse onto the floor like a sack of potatoes. But even then, it didn't stop. I wasn't going to leave without completing my objective. By this point, I had been completely and utterly possessed. I kicked her right smack in her face with my steel boot immediately after she started to realize what was happening to her. It still wasn't done. She was going to die by MY FUCKING HAND! Without a second wasted, I sat on her chest and began to beat the ever-loving shit out of her. I could feel every single punch push an unhealthy dose of dopamine throughout my entire body. With every last one, I wanted more. The impacts of my fists harmonized with my repetitive 'I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!''s, the 'DIE, DIE, DIE!''s, so on and so forth. After a few throws, teeth started to chip away from her mouth. I didn't give myself the chance to look at Trish's face before shoving her against the lockers and beginning to strangle her. This was sure to be the thing to finish her off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But before I knew it, it all came to a screeching halt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon had yanked me back and was desperately clutching onto me like a teddy bear. He screamed at me, begging for me to stop what I was doing. When I heard his voice, the inner noise instantly vanished, but after realizing what was really happening I almost wished it hadn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There was Trish, beaten and bloody, sitting on the ground and looking at me with a terrified stare that shall forever be carved into my retinas. The next thing I noticed was the sensation creeping down my arms. It was her blood, ever so slightly trickling down my arms, dripping from my claws to create small, audible droplets on the floor; A consequential byproduct of my sin. My shoulder was becoming drenched with Anon's fresh, sorrowful tears quickly turning ice-cold and seeping through my shirt. Then the guilt began to set in. Lord, I will never forget how I felt when it hit me. I couldn't understand exactly what the voices were saying, but it was along the lines of, "Look at what you just did.". "What have you done?". "You loveless psychopath.". The world around me was violently crashing down, and I appropriately followed along. Not only had I fallen into a horrible psychotic episode in front of the whole school, but it was very likely that I had also compromised Anon's friendships in the process.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I was sitting in his room, sobbing, pathetically listening to imagined voices coming from puppet hands. Even though Anon had to deal with that along with knowing the Allosaurus in his bed was the same one responsible for this entire shitshow, it somehow didn't push him away. Through all of the insanity, he stayed. The rest of the day was spent staying by Anon and listening to his comforting words. Granted he was rightfully pissed from earlier that morning, but he eventually approached and stuck by. You wouldn't believe how relieved I was when he said he forgave me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's what cemented us. The moment I realized that he was willing to stay by my side and help me face my demons even after he'd seen the worst of me. After I'd seen the worst of HIM.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But today's not meant for ruminating on regrets or staying in a loop of tired melancholy. In fact, it's quite the opposite. I'm going to show him how much I love him. It'll get his blood pumping for sure.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He won't be able to walk for a week when I'm through with him~</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Dear Diary</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Today was a special day. It marks the pinnacle of my life; The peak. My final entry.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This was Anon and I's wedding day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't have too much to write on this. All I have to say was that I wouldn't have had it any other way. Our friends and family were there for us, beautiful music bounced throughout the church while my husband awaited eagerly for me at the front. All of our hardships had lead to this. Graduation. College. Our times of weakness. It has lead us to here, and by God, it was worth it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And the voices, the static, the existential dread, the self doubt?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's all gone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And I will not let those demons return. Now, there is no longer a reason to have them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We shall no longer face the world by ourselves, but together. As Husband and Wife-</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Charity?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ch- woooah."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon, still in his suit, walks in on his newly-wed wife sitting at the room's desk writing away in what was supposed to be a surprise outfit. Her hair was down, her chest was topless with black taped X's covering the nipples, and her limbs were covered in pink and black nylons stretching up all the way to her thighs and shoulders. The final finishing touch was black, sparkling panties that shined in every direction you looked at them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'Christ, she's hot.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Although it caught her by surprise, Charity wasn't about to let this kill the mood.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Aww. You caught me at a bad time, sweetie. This was going to be a surprise, you naughty boy~"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I didn't expect you to be so eager to make our baby already~"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Luckily for Charity, Anon was still prone to having his brain buffer in situations like these. Seeing this only doubled her confidence AND libido.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Admit it, Nonny. You want to bust your creamy human juice into my aching... EAGER womb. You want to keep Hope in my body soooo badly, don't you~?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I can imagine how many times you thought of me... pregnant, and barefoot in the kitchen. You can't hide it from me, skinnie boy~"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">BRAIN.EXE: UNRESPONSIVE</div><div class="fanfic-line">NEURONS: ACTIVATED</div><div class="fanfic-line">DONG: EXPANDED</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, I 'Hope' you're ready, because I'm not letting you go~"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For Charity, time stopped for a brief moment. She sometimes forgot that she was just as if not more autistic than her beloved. Looks like said beloved fully agrees with that sentiment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ha, ha. I 'Hope' you've got better jokes lined up, because that was just sad."</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, get over here, dork~"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For Anon and Charity, it was shaping up to be a looong wedding night....</div>
