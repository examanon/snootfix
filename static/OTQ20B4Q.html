I'd rather not get strangled for being high while marrying his daughter."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fair enough bro, ever since legalization and all he's been more relaxed around me, especially since I made a 'respectable career' out of it and all."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Well, that's good at least."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed nods lightly, pulling up a plastic chair next to the one I was in before crashing down into it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Still, there's nothing you really need to worry about bro. Lucy really does love you, and that's why we're all here today, you know?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah, I splashed so much cash on making sure this day would be perfect for her... getting Moe to cater some high quality pasta was easy, but the seafood and all? Don't even get me started how much I spent on that 'gourmet dino nugget bar'."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I totally thought you were joking when you texted me about that, but then I saw it myself man... that's dedication right there."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I mean, she's worth it really, every bit of effort and every cent of cost."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>he reaches over and gives me a firm pat on the back</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You deserve it just as well man, you helped dig her out of a hard part of her life.
