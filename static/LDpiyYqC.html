                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Doomer Lucy</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: Complete</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Anon, Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Anonymous</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It becomes a regular occurrence, your nightly fucks with her becoming longer, more drawn out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Gone is the scent of cheap perfume, replaced by her own; she smells faintly of old cigarette smoke and tar, her feathers brushing against your arms as she begs you to hold her tight, hold her longer, for just a few more minutes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Soon, you start seeing each other elsewhere; she's at the library, looking for books on music theory while you were searching for a good sci-fi thriller, or you're at the grocery store on her days off, buying fresh food and liquor for the nightly fun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before long, you start inviting her to your place; you didn't realize it yet, but that was the nicest thing anyone had done for her in a long, LONG time, her so-called friends having long since abandoned her. Naomi, your roommate, promised to let the two of you have your fun alone that night; she had a date herself, after all, and her girlfriend wasn't one to wait up for her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eventually, you'd get curious, pressuring her to let you see her own place; it wasn't anything special, rather it was quite the opposite. A simple apartment, just barely large enough to fit enough furnishing for one person to live somewhat comfortably.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She would sob at the notion of moving in with you, tears of joy streaking down her face as she envelops you in the fluffiest hug you'd ever experience, though it would be she who would pop the big question in the end.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'Do you love me, Anon?' She'd ask one night, while you two gazed up at the stars from the rooftop of the apartment building, and you'd realize that yes, you DO love her, more than anything in the world as you pull her closer, and whisper that one, almighty word. 'Yes.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The next few days are a blur; things picking up speed not long after the two of you officiated your relationship status with each other.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Soon, though, it comes time to meet her parents. You hadn't really heard much about them from Lucy herself, only that her dad had a tendency to be a bit of a hardass, with her mother being the one who ultimately wore the pants in the relationship. In her own words, 'They'd put you through the wringer for a bit, but they should warm up to you pretty quickly.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Their house stands in stark contrast to the dingy apartment Lucy had been living in prior to her moving in with you; it wasn't quite McMansion territory, but it managed to straddle the line between tastefully spacious and extraordinarily gaudy. You remembered asking Lucy why she didn't just ask her parents for help finding a home, to which she sheepishly replied that she 'wanted to prove that she could handle herself well enough'.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Dinner went well, surprisingly. Her father, true to Lucy's word, raked you over the coals for a bit; questions about your job, your habits, your friends (ha) bombarded you for the first hour or so, only appearing to be satisfied once you mentioned that Lucy had moved in with you at your request.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The dinner ended with, among other things, a firm handshake from her father and a decidedly fluffy hug from her mother. That didn't mean that your night was over, of course, with Lucy nuzzling her snoot against your neck as you both climbed into the car, her hand incomspicuously drifting down into your pants as the engine roared to life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Neither of you got much sleep that night.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There was a certain phrase your father kept using, one that never really left you. 'Stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea', or something like that. As far as you both could tell, it was just an elaborate way to say 'Damned if you do, damned if you don't.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Here, though, as you held that small velvet box in the palm of your hand, you really couldn't think of any better way to describe how you felt. It wasn't that you didn't love Lucy, oh no, not at all. Rather, it was the anticipation, the fear of what might come next.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You both had a dinner date at a fairly fancy restaurant that night, one where you had initially planned on popping that all-important question to the woman who would be the love of your life, and yet as you sat there in your car you could only feel... doubt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You knew she loved you. That wasn't even a question. But what weighed most on your mind was that traitorous idea that maybe, just maybe, she saw you as nothing more than a free ride, a way out of her own admittedly-miserable lifestyle for no more than the occasional night of passionate lovemaking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And you hated yourself for it, for even daring to think that such a thing could possibly be true, that there was even the slightest chance that she was using you.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Steeling yourself, you walked into the restaurant; Lucy had already been seated, a look of mock anger in her eye as she playfully admonished you for being late, the waiter coming over shortly afterwards to hand out the drink menus.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Taking a brief moment to reflect, you consider just how far the two of you have come together; you've both come a long, long way since you first met, and that gives you an idea.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As soon as the check comes, you ask Lucy to come with you, to just take a walk around town.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You stop in front of the alleyway where the two of you first met; it takes her a moment to recognize what this place is, enough time for you to slip the box out of your jacket pocket, and get down on one knee...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She said yes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's been a few months since you married Lucy, since you swept her off her feet in the chapel and carried her to the limo waiting outside to take the two of you home.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Since then, she's quit her job at the Shop'n'Save, making a fairly decent living as she taught music theory at the high school you both went through; after all, with a kid on the way it wouldn't do to have her be working a stressful job of any sorts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You, meanwhile, became the school counselor; you'd both figured that it'd be the best place for you in town. Of course, being closer to your wonderfully fluffy wife might've had something to do with it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naomi, meanwhile, got engaged to her soon-to-be wife; Lucy couldn't hold back her smile when she saw Trish walking down the aisle, the Triceratops practically beaming with joy as she said her vows.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Now you lay here, on the rooftop of Volcano High; your hand draped over the pregnant swell of Lucy's belly as she nuzzled her snoot into your shoulder, the afterglow of the past half-hour just barely having faded as the setting sun sets the sky ablaze. For a brief moment, you feel a withering dread for what the future might hold; all it takes is Lucy squeezing your hand tightly to banish those treacherous thoughts, dread finding itself replaced with nothing more than sheer anticipation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sometimes, everything turns out okay. And even if it didn't, even if you found yourself stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As long as you had Lucy, you were ready for anything.</div>
