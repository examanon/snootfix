                    <div class="fanfic-line">Chapter 2</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A clawed hand desperately searches for the source of the blaring noise that has so rudely awoken its owner. Eventually, it finds the old digital alarm clock. Several direct hits to its cheap plastic housing silence the noisy contraption. Fully awake, despite not wanting to be, the ptero swings her feet off of the bed and onto the ugly carpet covering the cold floor. After a long and proper stretch of her arms and wings later, her morning ritual can begin. Brush, comb, groom, makeup. She considers combining scowling at her reflection while applying eyeliner to save time in the future. Maybe just shatter the thing and forget about the security deposit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Waking up a little earlier today gives Fang enough time for breakfast. If only she had either the willpower or knowledge to cook something properly. Should have listened to mom when she suggested learning how to cook. Should have done several things differently. With a quick shake of her head, Fang banishes the intrusive thoughts for the time being. It's too early for regrets. Those get their turn before going to bed. Several pieces of salami drowned in barbecue sauce might not be gourmet cooking, but it's better than nothing. Probably should have brushed her teeth after breakfast. Living on her own is proving far more challenging than expected. For each chore finished, two more take their place. Fang glances at the instrument leaning against the wall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'Today for sure. Just have to go to the store after school and...'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A loud groan escapes her as she grabs her backpack and other essentials scattered across the table. Descending the mercifully empty stairs, Fang can't help but mope. Is this how it's like being an adult? Free time devoured by endless bullshit tasks, leaving her too exhausted for anything she actually cares about?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'No wonder mom and dad are the way they are.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Quickly looking at her phone to see what kind of pace she has to keep, Fang realizes she doesn't have to be in a hurry today. Might as well check her messages. Ignoring the dozens of unread texts from Trish leaves just one from Reed and one from her mom. The one from Reed was about Trish. The ptero was more surprised that he even wrote than she was about its contents. Samantha is asking how things are going. For a brief moment, Fang considers being honest with her mother. Would she understand? Does she even care and is only asking because that's what mothers are supposed to do? The ptero decides to just lie that everything is going great. It's not like she's lonelier than ever with absolutely zero friends. Then again, with the kind of friends she had back at Volcano High, who needs enemies?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Staring, whispering, and finger-pointing once again accompany the ptero on her way to the first period. At least everyone is keeping their distance. A few of the more skittish students even make an attempt to get out of her way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'If you can't be loved, then at least be feared.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang chuckles to herself, remembering a line from that stupid book Mr. Tsuki made them read last year. Can't afford to get into a fight every day. Even if these speciest fucks all deserve their asses kicked. Fang hears the tubby girl from yesterday a few seconds before she sees her. Looks like she hasn't learned her lesson judging from how she's running her mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Can you believe that dumb bitch was talking to-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Whatever she was about to say dies in the throat when she sees Fang approaching. Four lines run across the fat girl's face, giving her the cliche appearance of a veteran from the war movies Ripley likes to watch. Seconds after making eye contact with Fang, the would-be bully suddenly remembers she needs to be somewhere else. Nearly bowling over a few members of her clique in the process, the girl huffs and puffs as far away from Fang as possible. Judging by how pale she'd gotten, it's the bathroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'Dad was right, nothing but weaklings and cowards.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">More pointless inductions follow. It's not like any of these people give a rat's ass about her beyond making fun of her. All she can do is hope something happens that shifts the focus off of her for a while. Spending time between classes hiding in the bathroom was the only thing she could think of to get away from their judgmental eyes. The stench in the bathroom was horrid, but at least no one would notice the cigarette smoke. Hell, it might as well act as an air freshener. Either humans have a much worse sense of smell, or this school really needs to hire a cleaning company. With one final drag, the nicotine stick is spent. Time to brave the hallways once again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'Only day two, and you're already a pariah. Good job.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Throwing the filter into the toilet, Fang pulls one the lever, flushing away the evidence. Before exiting the bathroom, she glances at the filthy sink. One would probably end up being dirtier after using it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'Thank god I didn't actually have to go. What a bunch of filthy monkeys.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A swift kick with her combat boot opens the door wide open to avoid touching the filthy handle. Next up, science class. She already has the timing down, entering the room simultaneously as the bell rings. The teacher, a short bald and fat man, looks at her impatiently. It reminded her of Volcano High's mat teacher. The only thing he's missing is a mustache and gold chain. Ignoring the teacher's glare, Fang takes her time surveying the classroom looking for a vacant seat. She can't believe her luck. At the back of the class is an empty seat. And it's next to the same human she shared detention with yesterday. Would it be too much to ask if Anon was also good at science? She desperately needed someone to mooch of off now that Reed's cheat sheets were no longer an option.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon doesn't notice her approaching until the last moment. His expression is puzzling, to say the least. Fang wasn't expecting him to jump for joy, but she wasn't expecting such blatant suspicion. A few students snicker as she reaches for the empty chair.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"This seat taken?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A mere formality, considering there were no other empty seats, but she can't afford to be hostile to every single human in the school. No matter how much they deserved it. After several seconds Anon snaps out of whatever spell he's under and responds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wait, are you serious?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">More snickering, accompanied by some laughter this time. It's getting harder for Fang to ignore them. Anon acting so weird isn't helping either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Look, I'm sorry, but this is the only free seat left. I promise I won't fucking bite you if that's what you're worried about."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No. No! It's not that. I just..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The teacher has finally run out of patience.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Miss Aaran, can you please take your seat already?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With the matter settled by an outside force, Fang sits down. Anon can stand if it bothers him that much. To think she even for a moment thought he wasn't that bad. At least the teacher didn't make her introduce herself this time. Instead, he just handed out several pages of worksheets before going back to his desk to read what looked like a porn magazine. At least Mr. Carldelewski attempted to hide what he was reading. A poor attempt most of the time, but at least he made an effort.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Relying entirely on Reed and his anonymous source to pass science class has finally come to bite her in the ass. Fang couldn't figure out how to even attempt solving the first question, let alone the harder ones or the others that refer to the solution of the previous question. A quick glance at Anon's worksheet shows he's having no issues whatsoever. For a brief moment, Fang considers asking him for help. Instead, she begins copying his work. Can always ask for forgiveness in lieu of permission.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Scribbling as fast as she can, Fang can barely copy the solution to the first question before Anon turns the page.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'Fuck it, might as well ask.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey, think you can go back to the previous page?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon looks up from his sheet, tiny beads of sweat forming on his brow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Because... I want to see if I got the answer to the previous question right."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You'll never understand it if you just copy the solutions from someone else."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">While not a lie with a lot of thought put into it, it still stung how quickly Anon figured out what she was trying to do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Look, I'm sorry if I bother you, but I don't need you to lecture me. I'll just go ask the teacher. That's why he's here for anyway."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon's lack of facial features made it difficult to get a read on him at the best of times, but it was clear Fang's words got to him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I...I never said you bothered me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Pausing while in the awkward pose between standing and sitting, the ptero looks at the human.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Could have fooled me with how you were acting."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sorry. I'm just not used to anyone approaching me without wanting to prank me or something. People at this school tend to be assholes."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The ptero slumps back into her seat, letting out a long sigh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You're telling me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Moving his seat slightly closer to Fang, Anon turns back to the first page.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What if I explained it to you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang motions towards the teacher with her beak. The man is far too preoccupied with his magazine to notice what's happening in the classroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Isn't that his job?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon can barely keep himself from laughing out loud.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Good luck with that. Convincing Mr. Coomer to explain something is like getting blood from a stone. My offer is still open."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The questions aren't nearly as daunting as Fang first thought. While Anon's teaching method leaves much to be desired, it's better than nothing. Surprisingly quickly, Fang has enough of a grasp on the subject to solve some of the problems alone. Divvying up the questions allows them to make up for lost time and finish just as the bell rings. Neither of them is eager to brave the judgmental halls and take their sweet time packing up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I have a free period next. Could help you with any science questions you might have. I mean, if you want..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A smile crept on the ptero's face unbidden. For the first time since transferring, Fang didn't feel entirely miserable.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'd definitely appreciate it, but I have music class next."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"O-oh, well, some other time then."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The duo slowly makes their way to the door, mentally preparing for whatever bullshit they'll be forced to endure in the halls. Something Anon said keeps bothering the ptero.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wait, did you say free period? Isn't the next one supposed to be whatever you have for your elective?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well..., yeah."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And you picked nothing?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Judging from Anon's expression, she should have worded that differently.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. It's just that..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her mind races, desperately trying to find the words to not make it seem like she thinks Anon is a talentless loser.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's just that it would have been nice if we had another class together."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">'Nailed it. Wait...'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If anything, she had only made things worse. If Anon was in a good mood before, he sure as hell isn't anymore. He is far less animated than he was just moments ago.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We actually share several classes."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Embarrassment colored her cheeks a deep red.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry. Guess I just didn't notice you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, that happens a lot."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Suddenly all she could taste was her boot. Could being awful with words be hereditary? Current data suggests yes. Fang had almost proposed spending lunch period together but decided against it at the last second. Given her track record, it would have only backfired, somehow. Never before was Fang as happy to hear the ringing of the school bell as she was at that moment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorrygottorun."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not waiting for Anon to reply, the ptero bolts towards her next class. She felt terrible and could only hope Anon wouldn't be too bothered tomorrow.</div>
