It was even nicer than the one Naser has</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">and on the day of the prom 47 dropped me off at the front of the school and walked the way up the steps and saw the whole gang up there and I over heard Naser saying “anon will never be drip, his broke ass suit from Walmart”, then finally turning to see me Naser stood there agist “anon is fucking drip” “well thank you”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I replied then unfortunately for myself the next thing I said when I saw trish standing there was blurting out “wass goood myy trigger” then presided to reee at me with extreme intensity and proceeded to punch me, time stood still my whole life flashed before my eyes, that’s a lot of shitposting and jerking off, an abnormal amount of times, maybe I need to reconsider my life a little bit, but right now I need to refocus on the incoming punch that’s about to deck my ass,</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">but just before it made contact with my face 47 showed up out of no where to intercept it. Trish shocked stood back and slowly walked away but not before 47 took his briefcase and chucked it like an axe at trishe’s face it seemed to have a supernatural tracking ability and it keep going after her just going on and on in awe of what just happened, we just walked in silence, then 47 proceeded to shimmy up the water gutter pipe into the second story window jumping in avoiding all the security cameras, making it to the security room and successfully disconnecting it, slowly making his way to the principles office, Spears was just taking a break from the festivities by watching lucky star on his small room tv, 47 got him to stand up and walk over to the tossed soda can 47 threw, and before he know it 47 was chocking the brute out, even through Spears tried he was no match for 47, before he left he looked at the computer logged on the to the grading system changed anon’s c average to a b+ and tanked trish’s average to a d-,</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">then he proceeded to take the suit and dump the body in the near by gym locker, entering the gym no one seemed the wiser seems like all it takes is just the clothes and the glasses and no one will notice, he walked towards the other side towards anon yelling over the music “how are you enjoying your prom so far anon?” anon in disbelief in what he was seeing before him just said “good yeah” then 47 left to walk over too rosa too woo her in Spanish</div>
