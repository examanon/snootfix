                <div class="fanfic-text">
                    <div class="fanfic-line">Chapter 1: The Weeb's Trap</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Remind me again why I’m here?” I asked Stella, doing my best to hide both my disinterest and annoyance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“To watch the new pilot of SAO with me, of course!” Stella answered in her usual bubbly tone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I rolled my eyes at her words. “Yeah, so, WHY am I here?” I asked again, this time with extra emphasis.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh, come on, it can’t be that bad!” Stella replied, all the while smiling ear to ear, though I don’t think that would quite describe it, what with dinos not having visible ears. “I know season two was kinda weak, but this is gonna be infinitely better because…” the lime yellow-toned stego’s words drone on. I sigh and start formulating some generic response in my head as I tune out her narration about the plot and better character development and other things I couldn’t care less about. My inattentiveness doesn’t last long as I’m snapped back to my unfortunate reality when Stella elbows me on the ribs. “...plus, you have me all to yourself! Isn’t that cool?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I run my hand over the spot where Stella’s elbow struck me in the chest and nod. My mind tells me I should at least feign a smile, but I can’t even bring myself to do that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We’re outside Stella’s room in the Volcano High dorms. ‘I didn’t even know there were dorms,’ I think as the memory of the fancy four-story structure’s exterior comes back to me. Stella is sharing a room with Rosa. I assume that’s how the two got to be friends in the first place. I can hardly imagine any other scenario in which anyone would willingly befriend the lime-yellow stego. I mean, her personality’s okay for the most part, but her random weird stuff is... well, *weird.* Like with the tarot cards and other occult stuff. If her only interests were anime and something else on the normal side like forum surfing and shitposting, she’d be an 8/10 qt3.14. Hell, I’d even say a 9 if she learned when to keep her mouth from running too much.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella opens the door to her room and ushers me inside. For some reason, I expected walls covered with pink plush carpeting, a tacky rug, and anime-themed bedsheets. With pink on everything. Instead, the room looked like another dorm room. Cupboards, a bunk bed, two desks, and a mini-fridge were about the only pieces of furniture in the area. There are school supplies and clothes thrown around, though. If I had to take a guess, it was probably Stella’s doing, as I can’t picture prim and proper Rosa leaving anything strewn about. The only things that are out of the ordinary are the posters. Or rather, the absence of them. Almost the entire wall’s covered with dots and lines, some of which I recognize as constellations. What I guess to be a moon cycle chart hangs right next to the bed. Once again, it doesn’t take me long to figure out the impromptu wallpaper and chart are the work of my lime-yellow stego friend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Sorry, Anon. I didn’t really have the time to clean up!” Stella chirps. She’s blushing as she says it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not gonna lie. That’s kinda cute.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without much ceremony, Stella picks up a laptop from one of the desks and puts it on the top bunk. “Alright, climb on up. I’ll be back in a sec!” she says with a chipper tone and what I just barely catch as a wink. She disappears behind a door that I didn’t even notice was there, the drawings of stars on it blending in with the wall too much.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look up at the bunk bed and raise an eyebrow. ‘So um... she wants me to… Uhhhhhh…’ I rub my chin with my fingers and make my way towards the vertically stacked beds. I was under the impression that we were going to sit on chairs. Maybe lay on a big fuzzy sofa. Sharing a bed, though—A single bed, mind you—was not what I imagined.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I let out a soft groan. ‘How am I going to explain this to Fang?’ I ask myself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without another thought, I climb the ladder and sit upon the edge of the bed, my legs dangling down. I turn my head to see what kind of things Stella keeps on her mattress. Sure enough, there are some plushies by her pillow. One looks like a rabbit, but the others are various nondescript figures that I can’t name. At least one is of a Gundam from that one super weird chibi incarnation. As I try to recall the name of that particular series, something catches my nose, a scent mixing strawberries and roses. I pat the mattress one more time, causing the aroma to intensify. ‘Her bed smells nice,’ I think, all the while letting myself get lost in the pleasant fruity aromas.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh, Anon!” Stella calls to me, snapping me away from the desire to bury my head in Stella’s bed. True to her word, she returns a few moments later. Except…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘Wait,’ I think as my eyes fall on Stella. “Oh my fucking god...” I mumble as my eyes widen. “Is she… cosplaying?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There, before me, stands Stella dressed in such a way that I have never seen her before. In place of her usual shirt and short jeans, she’s donned a weirdly—or should I say tactically—cut green-white leotard kind of deal, a white scarf, and a blue wig. Even with my limited knowledge of Sword Art Online, I can tell that she’s supposed to be the new heroine from the season three trailers: Asado Shino. She’s even got the breasts for it. The only thing breaking the image is that spindly leg grab with her tail Stella does when excited or nervous.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“W-well, how do I look?” Stella stammered out her question, her cheeks turning a light crimson in the process.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Umm... nice?” I answer, all the while rubbing the back of my head. I don’t know what kind of answer she’s expecting, but she seems content enough with my reply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without another word from either of us, she climbs up halfway and motions for me to lay correctly on the bed instead of sideways.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘Oh no, she seriously wants to do it like that?’ I think as I look over the bed again. ‘Pressed shoulder to shoulder on this narrow fucking bed? Not to mention other extremities…’ I let out a snort. ‘Fine. She won that bet after all. I just hope my pride can let me live this down later.'</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shuffle my body around, careful not to knock Stella off the ladder, and lay on my stomach as close to the wall as I can get. She then finishes her climb and lays next to me. Once she’s reposing on her bed, she picks up her laptop and puts it atop her pillow. Apart of me wants to point out that doing that would choke the poor machine, guaranteeing overheating and a fan full of dust and shit. Ultimately, I decide against saying anything. In truth, I don’t care that much. I just want to get the hangout over with.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Our bodies unavoidably press together as Stella gets comfortable. With her suit cut as it is, I’m very sure that her butt touches me many times. How is that fact not bothering her? I’m sure that my face is plain red right about now. Thank fuck I’m laying dick down and don’t have to worry about Stella noticing my little soldier rising to attention.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Over the next two minutes, Stella browses through various streaming sites she has subscriptions for. Once she narrows down a few high-quality sites with ‘proper subtitles'—which actually makes me chuckle a bit as I know that the best translations always come with the Blu-Ray releases and not with the broadcast airings—she asks me to choose one. Scanning over the options, I’m instantly drawn towards one of the streams that also includes a built-in option for user commentary. If I couldn’t enjoy SAO, I at least could enjoy reading what others thought about it. Stella seems very happily surprised by my decision, as the small hop on her bed, the cheerful clap, and the broad simper in her lips display. I roll my eyes at first but then giggle. ‘Her girlish excitement’s kinda cute, I guess,’ I ponder as I try to divert my thoughts away from Stella’s physical appearance. That’s made a bit harder as my mind busies itself tuning out most of the stego’s babbling about something about this or that idol or whatever, who’s apparently the hostess or something like that. Eventually, the SAO intro starts up, and I get deafened by a shrieking Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"AAAAAAAAAAAAAA"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!" Stella cries out as she grabs one of her more oversized plushies and muffles her screams with it, but not for long. As soon as the lyrics kick in, she starts singing along in very broken wapanese. I try to be friendly and gulp down the desire to laugh at her cringefest. In truth, her out-of-bounds enthusiasm moves some long-forgotten part of me. I mean, when was the last time I browsed headlines without looking for the next tortanic?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I push those thoughts aside and return my attention to the show. By the time I do, the opening has ended, and now we are following some generic-looking anime goons. It isn’t anything special, but Stella doesn’t seem to care. Her legs are up in a crossed position to stop them from running an invisible treadmill, and her tail is non-stop thrashing around. Every now and again, it wraps around one of her legs, but often she mistakes my limb for hers. Stella's closeness and touchiness push my alarms to maximum level. As a result, I can’t even concentrate on the episode. Instead, I’m wiping sweat off my brow and trying not to pay attention to her ass jiggle as she hops every time something ‘exciting’ happens. Unwelcome thoughts crowd my mind, like ‘does Stella even have a boyfriend?’ and ‘Oh fuck, I can’t tell Fang about any of this!’ I do my best to put such considerations out of my head, but I think I would have an easier time forgetting how to breathe.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The episode eventually ends, and she once again screams into the plushie. There’s a cliffhanger that I don’t care about, but Stella is on edge. “OmigoshAnonwasn’tthatthecoolestthingyoueversaw?” she asks me in such a rapid-fire way that I can’t even begin to unwrap her word’s meanings.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Lacking context, or even a clue to begin with, I reply with the first word that comes to mind. “...Okay...” I say in the most deadpan of deadpan tones.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Either content or still too high on her excitement to really dig too deep into my answer, Stella turns onto her back, staring wistfully up at the ceiling.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">One more scream, and it looks like she’s composed herself enough to actually speak coherently. “That was pretty cool, right?” She asks me as she sets her light blue eyes on mine. “Don’t you think that Sinon was cool? She’s so brave!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I have to carefully think about what I say here. Even though it’s Stella we’re talking about, I don’t want to take these giddy feels away from her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Y-yeah, it wasn’t that bad...” I answer half-heartedly, all the while putting on my best pretended smile. “Can I… go now?” I point to the door with my thumb, all the while never breaking eye contact with Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Aww! You really didn’t like it then? But it was so AAAAAAH! PEW PEW!” She replies to my words, even doing the finger guns, in my face, of course.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It um... It’s just not to my taste?” I say, all the while shrugging for added emphasis.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella breaks eye contact with me and goes silent, tugging on her sticky leotard awkwardly. Seconds later, she again snaps her eyes right into mine. “Will you watch the next episode with me?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’m honestly so flabbergasted by the sudden shift in Stella’s tone that it takes me quite a few seconds to come up with a reply. Both because of the question itself and her firm voice as she asks it. I find it odd that she'd want me around. Not like I’m in any shape, way, or form benefitting her viewing experience. I mean, she watched the episode practically by herself. I didn’t even need to be here. It hits me that she probably has no one to watch anime with, despite anime being a considerable part of her life. Maybe she gets Rosa to do it every now and again. Still, it’s not like Rosa would care about anime when she has other things she cares about more, like gardening and being a servant for our lord and savior, Raptor Jesus.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Despite a voice somewhere in the back of my mind telling me to drop the subject and go home, I can’t help but ask my next question. “This is pretty important to you, isn't it?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella blushes, hiding her face with the plushie till I can barely look into her eyes. “Yes,” she meekly replies.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘I will regret this. I will SO regret this...’</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Okay,” I say in as neutral a tone as I can muster. "I'll watch the next episode with you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella blinks a few times in response. “Really? Y-you will?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I nod in response. Not like I can add anything more, considering I’m still debating whether it’s actually worth it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella muffles another scream with her plush. She almost sounds like she’s getting asked out to prom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I again point to the door with my thumb. “But umm… I really have to go now. I, uh… promised Fang that’d I, uhhhhh…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella’s whole expression deflated pretty quickly at my words. “Yeah, yeah, okay. I gotta… study anyway…” she half-heartedly states.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wait for a second or two for her to get off the bed, but she won’t move an inch. She only looks at me expectantly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘Fine,’ I think as I try to climb over the stego, touching her as little as I can. ‘Dontlookathertits,’ I think over and over like some madness mantra. It was awkward enough that I was trying to climb over a girl lying on a bed. To have that same girl facing upwards and into my eyes as I tried climbing over her was already pushing this scenario into the kind of turf that led to pornos and hentai.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once again, I feel her tail wrap around one of my legs. I stop dead in my tracks. Practically doing a handstand above her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I first look towards the tail, then to Stella’s face. “Uhh... Stell—”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She cuts me off by grabbing me by the back of my neck and bringing me down on top of her, at which point she plants her lips onto mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘She’s kissing me,’ I think to myself, my eyes widening as the total weight of what was currently happening strikes me like the Mach 5 going at 200 miles per hour.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘STELLA.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘IS.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘FUCKING.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘KISSING.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘ME!’</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’m frozen on the spot. Despite my position, the best I can manage is not letting my hands grab Stella’s breasts. At that moment, I’m unnaturally aware of the heat and sweet scent of her body, as well as how her tail tightens around my leg muscles. Even the ever so faint strawberry flavor of her lipstick fills my head with a haze. It takes all my willpower not to return the kiss. In fact, I might even fail a bit in that regard.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sadly—‘I MEAN THANKFULLY’ I think to myself—the kiss doesn’t last long. Stella withdraws with one last, actually painful, love bite on my lower lip. We stare at each other for a few seconds. I can’t speak at all about what Stella’s love-addled mind must be thinking, but as far as mine goes, I’m grappling with the situation. Hundreds of thoughts run through my brain. From surprise at Stella’s forwardness to pride at having now kissed two girls in my life to horror at the realization that I had kissed someone other than Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Almost as if picking up on my growing terror—or perhaps having come to a similar conclusion all her own—Stella lets go of my leg and pushes me off her, sitting up on her bed and retreating behind the same oversized plushy she's been screaming into, gripping it so tight that only the upper half of her face is visible. “You should go, Anon…” she whispers as she looks intensely into my eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘Bitch, what the fuck!’ I think, very nearly forming the words on my tongue before stopping myself. ‘No. Shit’s weird enough as is,’ I tell myself as I quite spin-fall off the bed akin to my morning ritual, dashing for the door as soon as my feet land on the ground. As I reach for the handle, I glance back at Stella, who is still hiding behind her giant plushie. What little of her face that I can see betrays no emotion, although I swear her eyes look sharp; like she’s some kind of predator sizing up her next prey.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘No. Get out. Sort this out later,’ my mind tells me in response to the idea of asking the stego what had gotten into her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Heeding my brain’s advice without question, I exit the room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My head is spinning as I exit the dormitories. "What the fuck just happened?" I ask myself despite knowing I don’t really have an answer. I light one of the smokes that Fang lent me, taking a long drag. With the clarity and sharpness of the nicotine rushing through my body, I deduce that the ONLY reason Stella wanted me here tonight was to pull that stunt. ‘Fucking hell. Now I seriously can’t tell Fang about any of this,’ I bemoan as I take another drag of the cigarette. As I exhale the smoke, I notice some residue of Stella’s lipstick on the filter. Wiping my mouth reveals that not only am I thoroughly covered with it but that her hickey actually drew blood from my lower lip. I can already picture the conversation: “Oh yeah, hey Fang! Nah, don’t worry about it. I just headbutted the sidewalk, ha, ha!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Raptor Jesus, give me strength...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a second, I consider marching back into Stella’s room and forcing her to explain what she was thinking. Although, thinking about it a bit more rationally, what was there for her to explain? An affair is pretty fucking straightforward. The worst part is that I don’t exactly hate her for what she did…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look down at my hand, smeared with lipstick and my own blood. Slowly I lift it up to my mouth and lick it. Maybe I imagine it, but there seems to be a slight strawberry flavor to the residue I lick…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shake my head, trying to get the damn thoughts out. I wipe my face again and finish the cigarette.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fucking Stella,” I hiss through clenched teeth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The rest of the evening goes by in a relative whirl as I try to figure out how to explain what happened to Fang. It doesn’t matter how much I rack my brain for some kind of solution though, I’m coming up with nothing. I seriously doubt that I’ll be able to hold a poker face next time I see Stella. To top it all off, there’s a part of me that keeps going back to that kiss and how I felt seeing Stella be genuinely excited for her shitty anime. I grimace inwardly as I accept a terrible reality. I can’t deny enjoying both the feeling and the excitement that comes with the idea of secret love.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My stomach growls, and I get up from my bed. I’ve been trying to fall asleep for the last hour to no avail. Giving in to my hunger, I walk up to my fridge, toss whatever crappy TV dinner I have available into the microwave, and stare at the machine as if it's somehow going to give me answers. When the microwave's chime plays, I take out the food and scoop a bite of still soggy mash potatoes, but I don't enjoy the taste. Eventually, instinctual hunger wins, and I scarf down the meal unceremoniously and unpleasantly. Somehow, the food intake only leaves me feeling emptier than before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a groan of disgust, I decide to take a quick shower and try to go straight to bed again, skipping the sudden urge to indulge in a round of shitposting.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Unsurprisingly, the shower does little to help me sleep. I end up tossing and turning for a long time, unable to get the image of Stella in that tight leotard out of my head. Had she made it herself, or was it store bought? What kind of material was it made of? How had she gotten into it so fast? Had she gotten that cosplay to use at an upcoming con, or had she specifically used it to get a rise out of me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eventually, the questions become too much for me to bear. Reaching for my phone on the nightstand, I bring up my contacts list. I hover my finger over Stella’s name, the picture on her profile grinning back at me like it somehow knows that I would fall for her tricks. I glance at the time on my phone’s screen. It’s close to midnight. She might still be up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fuck,” whisper, running my free hand over my face. I had so many questions, but I also don’t want to talk to her about the evening. Was there even a way to bring up her outfit without remembering that kiss? Would she think I’m encouraging whatever it is she’s playing if I message her? ‘Maybe, just maybe, this was her plan all along,’ I assume as I bring down my finger on her profile and open up my text messaging. I’m only going to ask her about her cosplay. Not like I want something like nudes from her…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...Right…?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel a fuzzy feeling down in my trousers as my cock starts to stiffen. I sigh and begin typing. “You’re right boner, what’s the worst that could happen?” I mumble to no one in particular.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*hey u sleeping*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*r u still wearing the thing*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Too late do I realize I sent the message without punctuating it. “Punctuation is for retards anyway,” I tell myself as if that’s somehow an excuse for my lack of grammar.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A minute or so later, my phone lights up with incoming messages.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*hi Anon!!! <3*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*yeh, y?*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“A fucking heart right out the door,” I whisper as my brain tries to process Stella’s response. Something instinctual forces my fingers to type “send a pic,” but I erase it without sending.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A part of me is saying that I should stop. That I’m still well within the salvageable zone. That I can still walk out of this relatively unharmed and with my relationships unscathed. My more primal caveman instincts clubs that other voice in the back of the head and instead gives me a thumbs up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘All the fucking excuse I need!’ I think to myself as I then type “send nudes,” “send feet,” and “bobs and vagene.” I ALMOST fucking send “bitch lasagna” by accident. After that, I start typing in and deleting random letters so that she thinks I’m actually writing a message.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">‘What the fuck am I even doing? This is so wrong. I have a girlfriend, for fucks sake!’ I think as guilt tries to overpower the horny. Expectedly, horny wins out. My dick knows exactly what it is I want. Plus, it’s kind of adorkable that Stella still has the cosplay on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a deep inhale, I steel my resolve. Fuck me, here it goes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*send a pic?*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There is a five-second pause between me hitting send and Stella’s reply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*!!!*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh no. I fucked up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Did I fuck up?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yes. No. Maybe. I don’t know! Could you repeat the question?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My lizard brain tries getting answers out of my more rational brains. Sadly by this point, the rest of my brain has shut down, almost as if it wanted nothing to do with the clusterfuck of a plan.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There is no response from Stella for almost five minutes. I start zoning out, disappointed that in my lust-induced texting, I had probably weirded out Stella. Though really thinking about it, maybe it was for the best...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’m snapped from my slowly returning rationality when my phone buzzes. I instantly open my device and see that Stella, the madwoman, really did send me a picture. It’s dark—she probably didn’t want to alert Rosa—but I can definitely make out two shapely legs and a tummy. To my disbelief, she really is still in that leotard. She’s in bed too. One of her legs has her tail curled up on it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I find myself smiling like an idiot. What part of my rational thinking that isn't unconscious yet tells me I shouldn’t be getting this horny and excited.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*cute*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*more?*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I really should learn to stop when I’m ahead. This can’t possibly end well for me, but I can’t stop now. My inner caveman is raring to go.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*okie gimme a sec :$*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There’s no reply from Stella for almost ten minutes. I almost start falling asleep when my phone buzzes again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wasting no time, I open the messaging up and gaze upon the new photo. This one’s in a lit room this time. The bathroom by the look of the flooring. The picture is of one of Stella's hands. I don’t get it until I notice some opaque slimy goop on the end of her fingers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*sowwie daddy~ had a Lil accident <3*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My eyes go as wide as they can as I spring up from my bed. “Oh fuck. Oh god. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck,” I start repeating to myself, all the while beads of sweat begin to form on my forehead.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That’s hot as fuck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I ready my hand to begin fapping like the degenerate that I am, I pause in my tracks as I’m struck by a moment of lucidity. ‘Did Stella just fucking seriously...?’ I ask myself as the lust slowly begins to consume the lucid rationality. By the time the rest of that thought forms, it's already supplanted by that caveman in the back of my mind, who was now giving me two massive thumb’s ups.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, Anon, that’s it. You made a girl cum. You’re a fucking chad now!” I whisper with a wide goofy grin on my lips. The bliss doesn’t last long. Another flash of lucidity strikes me as I realize how fucked up what I was doing was. Stella had cummed without me doing anything to earn it. The least I could do was send an image back. Maybe a dick pick? No, a dick pic might be over the line. Then again, Stella and I probably passed the line a long time ago and were now halfway across the country.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">While I still debated whether I should send a dick pic, I sent a quick reply to Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*hawt*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Less than a minute after I sent out my message, Stella sent another picture. It would’ve been her boobs, but it’s all blurry like she fell while taking it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her following message explains it all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*fuk i woke rosa*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">*sry bye <3*</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I’m mortified at the prospect of Rosa finding out about what Stella and I have been up to. I hope she can explain it away somehow. Or, at the very least, get the shoe-to-the-face treatment for being a slut and not for… sending semi-nudes to a guy with a girlfriend…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">By this point, my inner caveman has retreated back to his cave of degeneracy, allowing my other rational sides to wake up once again. The total weight of my stupidity then begins sinking in like a bag of cement bricks to water.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Why did I do it?” I ask myself as I look over the pictures Stella managed to send before we were so rudely interrupted. Combined with the memory of the kiss, it did wonders to help the growing shame and guilt take over my mind. There is NO WAY I’ll be able to explain this shit to Fang anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No. Fang can’t know about ANY of this. Ever!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Realizing that I was still very hard, and not wanting Stella’s efforts to go to waste, I mutely jerk off to the pics. As I do, my mind begins wandering more and more. It’s not long before I go from simply jerking it to the images on my phone to straight-up imagining what it would be like to fuck Stella, her surprisingly lithe body rubbing against mine as we forsake any and all social expectations and make sweet, passionate, nerdy love…</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I honestly don’t know how long I’m at it. I only remember cumming harder than I had before in my life and passing the fuck out, my dreams filled with Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Only Stella...</div>
