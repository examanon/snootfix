                <div class="fanfic-text">
                    <div class="fanfic-line">It’s Saturday evening.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon looks over as Reed finalizes writing down another set of lines on a computer console in a room full of other servers. Anon wonders to himself how he might have never seen the I.T room back when he was a student of Volcano high, especially when it was this fancy. ‘Maybe Spears had it installed after I graduated,’ he ponders. Though with all the raw power the machines could output, he questions why the school had been so stingy with its bandwidth back in the day.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“And… there we are, bro! That should be the final line needed to get this show on the road,” Reed cheers as he pulls back and sighs, all the while wiping a few beads of sweat off his brow.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon looks over at the code and nods a few times while stroking his chin, lacking the hair necessary to make such an action meaningful.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hmm… I see…” Anon whispers as he stares deep into the last lines of code written by his pink velociraptor companion. He narrows his eyes as the human tries his best to absorb the code. Appreciate the code; BE the code…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“You… have no idea what’s on the screen, do you?” Reed asks with a growing smirk on his lips.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah. No clue,” Anon admits as he turns to look at his friend and shrugs. “Still, you wrote a lot, so that’s impressive at least.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Bro, shouldn’t you, like, actually know what’s on the code? You know, just in case you have to like, debug stuff, and I’m not available to do it?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Probably, but I’m not good with coding. Besides, I kinda have my hands full already, what with trying to keep this school running in tip-top shape.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed lets out a laugh as he exits to the main menu of the operating system and sets the system to an automated function. “I don’t mind helping out my best bro learning to code. Besides, you never know when it might come in handy.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fair, I guess-” Anon replies as he waits for Reed to put the final touches on the system. “I’ll clear a day for it sometime next week. I’m thinking Thursday?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed’s lips rise into a wide, all-encompassing grin. “My man, did you go ahead and do what I think you did?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon gives his friend a broad ear-to-ear smile of his own. “That’s right, Taco Thursday. Students love it!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed lets out a cheer as he fist-pumps the air. “Oh hell yeah! I’m SO down for Taco Thursday!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed types out some more commands on the main menu of the operating system, all the while his lips salivate at the idea of gorging himself on delicious Mexican food. He had to hand it to the cooks for taking and somehow improving on Rosa’s already spectacular cuisine. Quite the accomplishment if he was honest with himself.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Aight, bro. System’s more or less set to go-” Reed stands up from the chair and motions to the computer. “Wanna do the honors?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Are you sure everything’s good to go?” Anon asks as he takes a step towards the computer.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yup. You just gotta press that little button there, and the system Oughta spring into life!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Any last details I should keep in mind before I press the button?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed lets out a laugh as he reaches for his trademark thermos. “Nah, bro. It’s all coolsville from here on out.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon gives Reed a nod and looks at the screen before him. Emblazoned in bright green and white is a box, the question ‘Activate Room Fleet System?’ waiting for any user to confirm or deny.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Be honest with me, Reed. You think it’s a good idea to use roombas as my school’s cleaning crew instead of janitors? Lucy thinks I’m crazy for even suggesting it.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed laughs and pats Anon on the back. “Bro, this is, like, the greatest idea ever! You’re a true visionary, my man. You’re like…” Reed looks down at his hand and counts with his fingers before snorting and shaking his head. “You’re like a hundred steps ahead of everyone else in the United Nests! This crap will revolutionize school cleaning n stuff, man!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m just happy you were able to provide most of the materials. I owe you BIG.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anything for a bro!” Reed replies as he takes yet another sip of whatever it was that was in his thermos. Anon had a good idea of what it was that Reed was sipping down like water. His principal instincts told him he should scold Reed for even thinking of having—let alone using—narcotics on school grounds. Then he remembered that it was Reed he was dealing with. The pink raptor was never one to shy away from drug use and drug possession, even when they were students. Besides, it was a weekend, and they were probably the only people on campus that late in the evening—no need to worry about them setting a bad example for the students of Volcano High.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">With a final deep breath, Anon pressed the Y button on the keyboard. Soon as he does, the screen goes white for a few seconds before more strings of code begin playing on the screen. Following that was the whirring of a hundred different machines all over the campus.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed made another fist-pump motion and turned to face Anon. “Right on! This shit’s ready to rock!” he brought a hand up and smiled with the kind of jubilation one only witnessed after completing a long, arduous, yet rewarding task. Anon, realizing what his friend wanted, obliged Reed by slapping his raised hand with his own, all the while smiling just as widely as his dino friend.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Thanks, Reedman. Couldn’t have done this without you!” Anon exclaimed with a wide toothy grin.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed waves at Anon, all the while snickering like a teenager. “Shiet, bro, I’m happy to help out a bro in need!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon grabs Reed by the shoulder, and he leads him out of the I.T room. “Dinner's on me tonight!” The human cheers as he shuts off the lights allows the system to continue its functions without further human or dino input.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh hell yeah!” Reed cheers as he takes another sip of his thermos. “Let’s hit up Moe’s. Haven’t had one of his pies in forever!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“You got it. Let me just call up Lucy so she can meet us there!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Sweet!” Reed exclaims as he almost hops for joy.  Both human and raptor leave school grounds, Anon performing the usual alarm arming routine. Anon, confident that everything’s looking like spring, doesn’t wait for the alarm to fully arm before departing with Reed in tow, the two content with their work on the roomba fleet. Why, in Anon’s mind, he’s just accomplished something that no other principal in the United Nests probably had even considered. Sure, others may call him crazy… but craziness often led to brilliance. Or, at least Anon hoped so.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Unbeknownst to both Reed and Anon, while the alarm went through its arming phase, back in the I.T room, one of the roof tiles moved to the side very carefully to not disturb the area in too obvious a manner. Carefully, a bag full of mechanical materials descended to the ground. A figure garbed in all black except for their fluffy purple raptor tail soon followed after the sack. The figure’s face betrayed any attempts at recognition, the heavy black balaclava making sure of that. The instant the intruder touches the ground, they rush towards the nearby alarm paneling. Using an admittedly fancy PDA, they insert a strip of wires into the console and begin tapping away. Seconds later, and with an affirmative beep, the school alarm is deactivated before finishing its activation sequence.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">The intruder attaches the PDA to the alarm system and then turns to face the main computer in the I.T server room with a sigh of relief. The intruder rushes towards the computer and activates the system with a smile creeping over their shrouded face. Lines upon lines of code appear before them, and they, in turn, smile as wide as they possibly can. Wasting no time the instant the system becomes accessible via keyboard, the intruder begins tapping away at the keyboard at speeds that would have put champion typists to shame. With each passing second, the intruder rewrites Reed’s hard work, changing parameters, and twisting the code into an unrecognizable facsimile of what it used to be.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">When the intruder has altered the last code, they press the execute command on the system. At that point, another loud din of hundreds of small motors and vacuums resonates through the empty halls of Volcano High. With another command input, the intruder orders every roomba on campus grounds to leave their designated patrol areas and instead make their way towards the I.T room.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Within a matter of minutes, hundreds of roombas appear from seemingly everywhere. The audible sound of their suction motors was the only warning that the machines were appearing from out of the walls, almost as if the devices were coming out of the walls.  With another malicious smile on their lips, the intruder reaches into the bag they had brought with them and pulls out what almost looks to be some kind of miniature railgun. They call one of the machines to the front, the machine coming forth without a single bit of hesitation. With practiced speed and skill, the intruder installs the ‘weapon’ upon the roomba without wasting a single second. Soon as the intruder finishes their work, they call forth another machine and get to work on it, all the while cackling madly. The intruder repeats the process again and again. Their cackling only grows louder and more deranged with each machine they modified...</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">--- --- ---</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The following day, Principal Anon’s car pulls up in front of the school at precisely six in the morning. Out steps Anon, Lucy, and Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon and Lucy are dressed in a very formal casual style, with Anon opting to wear his old trademark green plaid shirt over a black turtleneck and a pair of dark gray chinos of the same brand that Naser wears on the regular. Lucy, meanwhile, sports her tan dress sweater and light blue pants, the outfit not that dissimilar to what she wears on daily while teaching.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">In complete contrast to the two members of Volcano High’s staff, Reed wore a pair of faded and ripped black shorts, a two-toned striped green sweater, and a cyan undershirt just a size too big for the raptor’s small frame.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’m telling you, man, something’s up with the system,” Reed explains to Anon as the trio make their way up the main stairs and towards the school’s main double doors.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“And you’re sure it’s not some kind of minor glitch that you couldn’t fix from your computer?” Anon asks as he reaches for the school keys.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“I would’ve if I could, but something’s also blocking outside access to the school network,” Reed answers as she tries once again to access the school’s wi-fi via his phone, to no real success.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“I mean, we did have to increase network security after Anon bricked the entire network playing that cheezy low-resolution video,” Lucy argues, all the while giving Anon a scolding glance.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon gives his wife a warm smile. “Hey, I said I was sorry. Besides, it was funny!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy rolls her eyes and crosses her arms. “Yeah. Hilarious,” she says in a deadpan tone.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed remembers the situation and how much of a mess that had turned out to be. He was honestly surprised the computers didn’t go up in flames from the strain the program put them under. The raptor gives a slight chuckle at the memory but otherwise keeps his mouth shut for fear of incurring Lucy’s wrath.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">It was far too early in the morning to get chewed out by the Mous matriarch.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“So, what exactly is the problem?” Lucy asks, turning to face Reed. “Only thing Anon told me was that it had to do with the main server or something like that.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Nah, man, not the server. The code INSIDE the server,” Reed answers in his usual chill self.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy perks an eyebrow. “Is there… any difference?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yah!” Reed answers as he once again pulls his phone and scrolls through remote data he could not access properly. “One’s hardware. The other’s software.” He taps the phone fruitlessly and eventually gives up with a loud groan. “Think of it like, a car. If the engine’s busted, ya gotta either fix it or get a new engine. But if the driver’s donzo, then ya gotta get a new driver, even though the car’s fine.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy shot Anon a glance and shrugged. Anon chuckled and turned to face his wife.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“What Reed’s saying is that it’s not the machine that’s the problem, but what’s controlling the machine.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy again tries racking her brain for some kind of answer, but ultimately, she gives up with a frustrated sigh.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Whatever it is, I hope it isn’t something that’ll affect us tomorrow.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“That’s why we’re here to check on the system,” Anon responds to his wife’s words. “The last thing we want is a bunch of non-functioning robotic vacuum cleaners disrupting classes and causing all kinds of mayhem. As funny as that would be.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh, don’t you even start with that!” Lucy practically roars, causing both Anon and Reed to flinch. “I don’t want to hear any of your guy’s nonsense today. I’m already kind of on edge leaving Amber with Stella.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“What? You bros worried about Stella?” Reed asks as he lets out a chuckle. “Brah, she’s like, totally chill and kid-friendly!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“That’s what worries me,” Lucy says as she fidgets around a bit. “What if Stella introduces Amber to something super violent like that Dragon Ball show that she and Rosa like so much?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Dragon Ball, violent?” Anon lets out a chuckle and shakes his head. “Dragon Ball is super vanilla! Knowing Stella, she’s probably showing Amber some kind of kiddie mecha show like Gundam Build Fighters or Zoids or something like that.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy gives anon a confused look. “I have no idea what you just said, but it worries me a bit.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon can’t help but have his wife’s words pierce through his thick skull as he too wonders what Stella is introducing little Amber to…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">---Meanwhile, in the Mous household---</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella is ecstatic about what she’s showing Amber next. She stands up from her seat and begins pumping her first in the air just as the TV blares the intro to the anime she had chosen—one of her all-time favorites, in fact. Amber, meanwhile, looked on with a mixture of excitement and confusion as her unofficial aunt’s excitement grew with every passing second.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">The music picked up in intensity, the lyrics starting up soon after. Stella, with wide-eyed rapture, quite literally  jumped up in the air as she began to sing along to the opening to the anime show ‘Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann’ at the top of her lungs:</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Kimi wa kikoeru? Boku no kono koe ga</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yami ni munashiku suikomareta</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Moshimo sekai ga imi wo motsu no nara</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Konna kimochi wo muda de wa nai!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Amber, suddenly feeling a jolt of energy the likes of which she’d never felt before in her life, begins to excitedly flap her wings in genuine excitement and hops around the living room, the music filling her soul with such levels of determined vigor that it makes her feel like she can kick logic to the curb and do the impossible.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">She looks into her auntie Stella’s eyes and, despite never once hearing the song before in her life, repeats the next set of lyrics almost word for word and in complete tune:</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hashiridashita omoi ga ima demo</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Kono mune wo tashikani tatauteru kara</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Kyou no boku ga sono saki ni tsuzuku</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Bokura nari no asu wo kizuiteiku</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Kotae wa sou itsumo koko ni aru!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella cheerfully claps, which only prompts Amber to flap her tiny wings with that much more excitement. The two then join together to sing the following verse in the song, their voices intertwined in their enthusiasm:</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Sugita kisetsu wo nagaku hima wa nai</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nido to mayotte shimawane youni</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Kazoe kirenai hon no sasaya kana</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sonna koukai kakaeta mama!"</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sono senaka dake oikakete koko made kitan da</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sagashite ita boku dake ni dekiru koto!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">---Back at the front entrance of Volcano High---</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon taps his chin a few more times before laughing heartily. “It’ll be fine!” Anon reassures his wife as he, at last, unlocks the door. “You worry too much. Besides, I have complete faith in Stella.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy lets out a snort, but a smile still forms on her lips nonetheless. She still thought Stella was a bit on the weird side—especially with her whole tarot readings and astrology stuff—but Anon was right; she was worrying way too much. ‘Besides, if he trusted her, then I should probably trust her just as much too.’</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">With Amber’s daily care more or less settled, Anon, Reed, and Lucy enter Volcano High’s premises. Everything appears as mundane as they remember, not a single aspect of the main hall out of place. That bodes well for their task that day. Yet as they stepped further in, something suddenly struck the trio as not quite right.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">It was silent. Far too silent. There was no beeping of an alarm warning whoever had just intruded to rush towards the control panel to shut off the device, nor the sounds of dozens of tiny robotic vacuums patrolling the hallways as their programming dictated. The silence was, in fact, almost deafening…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Uh… is it me, or are things way too quiet, even for a Sunday?” Anon asks as he turns to look at Reed and Lucy.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, no one’s on campus at all on Sunday,” Lucy chimed in, also looking around the eerily silent hallways. “Even if we had janitors, which we no longer don’t because of a certain someone’s hair-brained scheme—” the ptero matriarch says as she shoots Anon a glare, “—They wouldn’t be around today. Still… something does feel… off…”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeeeah, man… this shit’s far too quiet… REAL creepy-like…” Reed adds as he too begins glancing around. “Where are the roombas?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon and Reed look at each other. As they do, Reed’s face twists into one of anger and disappointment.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Like, goddammit, man…” Reed exclaims just loud enough that his voice some ways into the empty and silent halls. “Here I thought I got the system down all ironclad-like, but from the silence and the fact that the little roombas don’t seem to be anywhere, something did screw up with my programming...”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“We don’t know that yet, Reed,” Anon answers, putting a hand on the downcast raptor’s shoulder. “For all we know, it could just be a simple glitch in the system and have nothing at all to do with the code itself.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed gives Anon a nod of acceptance. Even so, the human can’t help but feel that his long-time friend doesn't quite believe the same thing. He’s almost tempted to reassure him further, but something tells him that it would make him come off as condescending.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Whatever other thoughts Anon has going to his mind are quickly discarded when, all of a sudden, the school alarms go off in a blaring chorus.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Shit!” Lucy shouts at the top of her lungs as she rushes past the reception area and to the back of the admissions desk, where she inputs her code to shut off the alarm, only to have it not work whatsoever.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“What the hell?” Lucy says out loud as she inputs her code again, only to have it come up as invalid once more.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon himself is ready to jump the desk and assist his wife with the code when his ears suddenly pick up the sound of air suction. He turns his attention down the hall, where he sees what must be at least two dozen little roombas coming towards them, their intention unknown, but their eye sensors glowing a bright red, making them appear to be enraged at whoever dared intrude upon their domain.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Well, there’s the roombas!” Reed says as he turns to face Anon. “Though, like, I don’t think they’re supposed to have those red lights, are they?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“No, they are not,” Anon replies as he finally manages to bypass the primary alarm system, shutting off the alarm and bringing in a slight sense of peace.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey, bro,” Reed says as he points towards the tiny machines, all of whom continue to move towards their locations steadily. “Did you, like, make any modifications to the roombas before we left yesterday?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Not really,” Anon answers as he makes his way out of the office and next to Reed. “Why’d you ask?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed points towards the little machines. The raptor’s about to open his mouth and speak his next set of words when the machines suddenly stop in their tracks, the sound of tiny motors whirring as whatever is strapped to the top of the chassis steadily aligns itself in their direction.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Before either Anon or Reed can process what they are seeing, the sounds of small pops begin to resonate throughout the hall. Seconds later, thousands of tiny balls start bouncing off the walls, roof, and ceiling, each one popping and spreading paint on impact.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon and Reed both dive behind the nearest wall to avoid the attack. Lucy herself takes cover behind the nearest desk, barely avoiding a volley of the tiny paintballs aimed in her direction.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon!” Lucy shouts, all the while glaring at her husband. “What did you do!?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“I swear, this isn’t my doing!” Anon snaps back, himself not sure what was now happening before his eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy turns to face Reed, who waves his arms in a panic. “H-hey, this ain’t my doing either!” he manages to stutter out, all the while fearfully trying to avoid directly gazing into Lucy’s rage-filled eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">The Mous matriarch lets out a groan. She’s not entirely buying the fact that her husband or her friend didn’t have anything to do with the situation now unfolding before her. Even so, she was finding it hard to believe that the two would so carelessly put the school at risk as she was now witnessing. ‘Anon can be an idiot, and Reed’s a pretty good enabler of that idiocy, but neither of them would pull something of this magnitude,’ Lucy thinks to herself. She tries to figure out some way to stop the literal catastrophe unfolding before her eyes as she thinks that. Because if they didn’t stop whatever it was that was now happening before Monday rolled around…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy sighs and facepalms. They already have enough trouble as is, thanks to Anon’s constant tomfoolery. He may mean well sometimes, but that doesn’t stop his various jokes or pranks from being particularly disruptive.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“So, Reed,” Anon starts, all the while doing his best to keep his body out of whatever targeting parameters the roombas had. “How do we stop the roombas from doing… whatever the hell it is that they’re doing right now?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed ponders the question for a second before the answer hits him pretty plainly.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“We gotta reach the server room and shut down the main computer that’s controlling them.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Great!” Anon says as he peeks over the side of the wall he’s using for cover, only to barely avoid getting hit in the face with a small paintball. “So, uh… how do we get past all the roombas so we can reach the third floor?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed taps his chin as he wonders the same thing. Eventually, he shrugs and shakes his head. “Dunno, amigo. We might just have to book it and hope we don’t get splattered with paint.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon lets out a frustrated sigh as he tries to think of a plan. ‘If only RAYmba were here. I’m sure he could talk to his brethren and get them to back off or something,’ the human muses as yet another stray paintball explodes close to his head.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“I mean, RAYmba’s like, pretty advanced for a phone roomba and stuff, but I don’t think they’re going to be winning over any of this bunch. They seem PRETTY pissed off at us, for some reason.” Reed’s eyes light up, and a sizable creeping smile forms on his lips.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon almost instantly knows what is about to happen, and he shoots a preemptive glare towards his salmon-toned companion.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“No. Don’t you EVEN think about it!” Anon warns Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed’s smile only grows wider at his friend’s warning.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Reed, I swear to Raptor Jesus...” Lucy chimes in, also shooting her friend a glare.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed chuckles as he looks between Anon and Lucy mischievously. “I guess you can say we’re the only ones who can stop...”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“REED, DON’T!” Anon and Lucy shout in unison.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“...This ROOMBASION!” Reed exclaims, a wide goofy grin forming on his lips as he does.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Both Anon and Lucy can only reply to Reed’s words with a collective facepalm. Even the roombas on the other side of the hall momentarily cease firing their pain pellets. A few even turn right around and depart the scene.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed can’t help but chuckle at his pun…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">---Meanwhile, on the top floor of Trish’s horn care and beautification office, downtown Volcaldera---</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish was typing away at her desk, careful not to let her anger over all the paperwork she still needed to complete bleed over into her writing. She could hardly keep a straight face as she typed out yet another letter explaining to her distributors why it was so crucial for them to get her precise drilling bit sizes instead of the standard bits sold commercially. It was honestly all so tiring for her. She wanted nothing more than to down a stiff drink while tossing insults at the first person who so much as dared to contradict her.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Suddenly, a shiver ran up her spine, causing her entire body to tremble for just a second. The sensation forced Trish to stop typing as she REALLY absorbed the feeling. She thought hard as to what the phenomenon could mean, and after not much thought, he came to the only realization that made sense to her: Somewhere, Reed had just made such an incredibly lame pun as to make the very universe cringe in reply.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish allows herself a small break as she gets up from her desk and walks to her office window. She looks out from her top-floor office and out towards the surrounding city, wondering just what on earth Reed could have said to cause her to cringe despite being so far away.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">The triceratops doesn't know why, nor does she care. All she knows for sure is that the next time she sees Reed, she’s going to punch him hard.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Very, VERY hard...</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">---Back in Volcano High---</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ignoring the literal aneurism that both Anon and Lucy felt like they were going to have over Reed’s words, the trio decided that now was as good a time as any to try and move on up towards the second floor. The problem was, there were still at least a dozen roombas waiting near the stairs. Getting past them would be a considerable challenge, that was for sure.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon suddenly comes up with an idea. Not a great idea, granted, but it was the best shot they have currently. “Reed, Lucy, I’m going to use myself as bait. While I do that, you two book it for the second floor.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy gives her husband a look of shock. “You sure that’s a good idea? You’re not exactly the most well-coordinated guy around.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon narrows his eyes at his wife but does not say a word to her. ‘Ouch. That hurt,’ he thinks to himself instead. Shaking his head, Anon stretches out a hand. Seconds later, a bunch of tiny paintballs try to hit it, the majority missing pretty wildly.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“I don’t think these roombas have good targeting. I don’t think I need to be too agile to avoid getting pelted.” Anon withdraws his hand and points to the stairs. “Not like we have another choice, honestly.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy, begrudgingly, agrees with her husband’s reckless scheme. She looks to Reed, who gives both Anon and Lucy a nod of understanding.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Okay. On three then,” Anon says as he skids to the side and places himself just shy of the wall’s edge. “One,” he begins counting, pointing with his hand. “Two…” he lowers his profile in preparation for his next move. “THREE!” he shouts, leaping out of the wall and right into the sights of the Roombas.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Just as Anon predicted, the sudden movement attracts the attention of the tiny machines, all of whom turn their tiny weapons towards their new target. Less than a second later, they are firing indiscriminately at Anon, who starts to run in the opposite direction, causing the machines to give chase and leave a large gap for Lucy and Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Both raptor and ptero take the opportunity to run towards the stairs. As soon as they arrive, they take cover behind the wall. Lucy peeks over and spots her husband hiding behind a pillar. “Anon!” she shouts, drawing his attention to her. “We’re good!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon gives his wife a nod and surveys the situation. He notices that if he’s bold enough about it, he can easily hop over the heads of the tiny machines, though he wonders if he’ll take a few stray paintballs in the process. Still, it’s a risk worth taking, especially now that they are close to their goal.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">With a deep sigh to steel himself, Anon lets out a warcry and rushes the machines, who are so stunned by the human’s sudden decision that they hesitate in their action. It gives Anon just the necessary opening to jump over the first few roombas before hopping over the heads of the next few. It doesn’t take long for the machines to aim and fire in his direction, however, and Anon winces as he feels a few paintballs hit him in the ass. Regardless, the tactic works, Volcano High’s principal can dash the remainder of the way towards the stairs, almost diving out of the way as both his wife and friend grab him by the arm and help him back to his feet. Wasting no further time, the trio dash up the stairs, not once looking back for fear of seeing a small swarm of robotic vacuum cleaners trailing after them.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">The trio practically dives out of the stairs, hitting the second floor’s floor with a pretty solid smack. They allow themselves a sigh of relief before standing back up.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy is the first to do anything other than catch her breath as she approaches Anon and hugs him. “Oh, that was so freaking stupid!” she scolds her husband, all the while embracing him like she just very nearly lost him. “Don’t EVER do something so reckless again!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“I mean, not like we had much of a choice,” Anon replies, all the while rubbing the sore spots on his back and ass where he got struck multiple times by paintballs. He winces as he touches a few choice places near his ass, already dreading the bruises that would no doubt form later.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">However, the small celebration is cut short when the trio hears the distinct sounds of suction coming from down the hall. The trio dives towards the nearest door, which Anon manages to unlock in record time. As the human and dinos hide in the darkened room, they hear the machines pass them by, their little mechanical eyes scanning for any sign of the intruders. They stick around for about half a minute before moving on down the hallway.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon leans out the door to see if the coast is clear. He manages to catch the machines turning down a corner, vanishing from sight.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon narrows down his eyes at the sight. It almost looks like the machines are hunting them down under the orders of something… or someone…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">With the coast more or less clear, Anon motions for the three of them to move on. Quietly, the trio makes their way down the hall and towards the next set of stairs. But before they can safely reach said stairs, a few more Roombas appear from out of nowhere. Unlike the other roombas from the floor below, these don’t have paintball railguns strapped to them. Instead, the roombas appear to have something else strapped to their chassis, something that looks very much like…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“PAINT BOMBS!” Anon shouts as he kicks the nearest roomba out of the way. The instant he does, the bomb attached to the chassis detonates, causing a massive splash of paint to stain the floors and walls.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy and Reed heed Anon’s warning, and they too move out of the way just as two more of the machines approach them before detonating. Because of the warning, neither ptero nor raptor got painted on, but the blast was close enough that a few specs of pain still made their way to the pair.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Like, holy crap, dudes! I didn’t program the roombas to be mad jihadist!” Reed comments as he tries to wipe away some of the specs of paint that managed to land on him.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Both Lucy and Anon give Reed a flat look. Anon was very much tempted to say ‘really’ out loud, but he keeps his mouth shut for the time being, as they have more pressing matters than scolding their friend for his lame sense of humor.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed lets out a sigh as he reaches into his pocket. “Oh man, I don’t think stuff would ever get this bad,” he laments as he grabs something, which he then brings out somberly. “But guess I was proven wrong!” he half cheered before once again turning somber.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“What are you talking about?” Lucy asks as she fixes her friend with a concerned look.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed turns to face Anon and extends his hand, motioning for the human to come forward and take whatever was in the palm of his hand. Anon looks around for a bit, and after giving it a bit of thought, nods and steps forwards, extending his hand to accept whatever it was that his dino friend had to offer him.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“My dude, when it comes to programming ‘n shiet, you gotta be able to cover all your bases, and cover your ass as well...” Reed opens the palm of his hand, dropping the item had been lugging in his pocket all morning. Anon looks at the palm of his hand and realizes that the object Reed dropped on his hand is a USB stick.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed lets out a chuckle as he puts his hand in his pockets and glances down at the floor. “That stick contains a kill code for my programming. I wrote it just in case there was some kind of glitch. Didn’t think I’d ever actually end up using tho,” Reed says as he gives a single bitter chuckle. “Guess I’m not that great a programmer as I thought I was if my little project went this far south…”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Uh… how often do your programs go haywire that you need to pre-empt a killswitch?” Lucy asks, not quite sure how to take the sight and words that were unfolding before her.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“My dudes, I promise this has only happened…” Reed looks down at his hand and begins counting with his fingers, each number bringing further shame to his eyes before he gives up with a frustrated sigh. “Okay, it’s, like, happened enough times that I gotta cover my ass. And no, that last pyrotechnics snafu wasn’t all my fault. I’m good with tech ‘n shiet, not fireworks and explosives. How was I supposed to know that the guy wanted half-loads of gunpowder instead of half more?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Neither Anon nor Lucy said a word to Reed in regards to what he said. They make a very deliberate decision not to think about it more than a surface consideration. They already had enough on their plate with the roombas running amok.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Okay, let’s worry about that little revelation later,” Lucy chimed in, grabbing both Anon and Reed by the shoulders and turning them to face the other end of the hallway. “We still have a third floor to get to.”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Both Anon and Reed nod in agreement. Not that dwelling on the past would do anything for anyone at this point.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">The trio once more set out down the hall and towards the stairs, careful to keep their movements silent despite their hastiness. It wasn’t easy for them, but they eventually make it to the stairway leading up to the next floor.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Just as the trio is about to celebrate their small victory over the roombas, one of the tiny machines just so happens to pass by, spotting the human and dinos. Soon as it does, it lets out a shrill set of beeps that travel all across the hall. In less than a second, the entire second floor is swarming with roombas, both of the shooty and exploding variety.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">The trio starts to make their way up the stairs, but it’s clear they aren’t going to make it far with the swarm right behind them. Things were, indeed, looking quite grim for the trio of Volcano High alumni…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">It was in that moment that a realization dawned upon Reed, one he had been quite eager to try and push to the back of his mind. At least until now. As he looked over at the mob of robotic cleaners, it dawned on him that there was only one way out of the mess he most likely started in the first place…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed turns to face his friends with a warm yet sorrowful expression. The corners of his lips rose as he made peace with the decision he was about to make. ‘For the sake of my bros,’ Reed thought as he took a step towards the mob of mechanical contraptions.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy is the first to realize just what it was that Reed planned on doing. With a wide-eyed look of horror, she reached out and grabbed his friend by the arm, all the while giving him a pleading stare. At that moment, whatever doubt she might have held towards one of her oldest friends vanished as regret over her previous words supplanted her previous assumptions.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed softly removes Lucy’s hand off his arm and lets out a chuckle that’s almost full of confidence, at least until near the end, when a bit of the young raptor’s doubt bubbles up to the surface. He turns to face Anon, the smile on his lips not once wavering. “It’s all up to you now, amigo,” Reed says as he takes another step towards the mob of automated vacuum cleaners. “Stop the machines. Save the school!” he suddenly yells at his friend as he tosses himself into the fray, landing right in the middle of the swarm of machines.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“REED!” Lucy shouts to no avail. She reaches out fruitless towards her friend, stopped from going further by her husband’s grip on her arm.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Within seconds, the machines are upon the raptor, tackling and falling upon him like a swarm of hungry locusts. Lucy looks away as Reed’s body vanishes underneath the multitude of roombas. He doesn’t scream. If he does, his voice is drowned out by the sound of furious suction…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Come on!” Anon shouts as he grabs Lucy and leads up the stairs and into the third floor, which is utterly devoid of machines, much to his relief. They don’t stop running until they've reached the front door of the IT room, at which point the two collapse near the wall and allow themselves to catch their breath.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">In this moment of respite, Lucy, unable to bear the thought of losing her friend so suddenly, breaks down into tears. “Why?” she asks herself as she struggles to remain standing. “W-why would he… do that?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon has no answer for his wife. Instead, he only grips the USB Reed gave him. It was now up to him to end this catastrophe and avenge his friend’s sacrifice. Furthermore, he makes a promise to himself. ‘When this is over, I’m naming my next kid in your honor, Reed…’</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon helps his wife back up. He wanted so badly to give her some time to grieve, but time was sadly something they didn’t have the luxury of, especially now that they were so close to their goal. Now was the time to finish what they started and avenge their fallen friend. Now was the time to set right what had gone wrong.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon and Lucy look at each other, and with a nod, they both take a step towards the door. They had no real idea what awaited them on the other side, but whatever it was, they were going to face it together as husband and wife.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon reaches for the door handle and turns it, opening it to a mostly dark room filled with various servers and a single master computer that controlled all aspects of Volcano High’s technology, including the roombas now terrorizing the campus.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon is the first person to set foot in the room, followed soon after by Lucy. The pair look around at the seemingly empty space with some relief. Yet, deep down, they can’t help but feel a pang of unease. It’s far too quiet and calm. It honestly couldn’t be this easy; something horrible had to be waiting for them.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Almost as if in reply to their innermost thoughts, the sound of a larger vacuum motor whirs to life. Anon and Lucy turned towards the sound source, making itself known as it rounded a corner to approach the human and ptero.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">The Roomba is enormous in comparison to its brethren, easily the size of a large dog. Upon its chassis, the name ‘R.O.U.S Mk I’ is printed in big, bold letters for all to witness.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy’s eyes widen in the realization of what the acronym stands for. She turns to face her husband with a flat narrowed-eyed look. “Did you and Reed buy a roomba of unusual size… to fill some kind of joke quota...?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon turns to face his wife and gives her an embarrassed smile and a shrug of his shoulder. “It was funny at the time, okay?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Lucy pinches the ridge of her snoot and lets out a frustrated sigh. ‘Oh wonderful. My husband’s penchant for ‘funny business’ just doomed us both…’ Lucy bemoans to herself.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Soon as Lucy finishes her thoughts, the machine trains its significantly larger paintball gun in the direction of the human and ptero. There is only a second between the sound of pressurized air prepping and the machine firing its salvo of paintballs. It gives Anon and Lucy just enough time to dive behind the nearest piece of cover, which in this case turns out to be a nearby desk.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">With the situation now as grim as it could be, Anon and Lucy found themselves with dwindling options. They had no way of fighting back against the oversized roomba, and stepping into its line of sight guaranteed a lot of pain from its paintballs. They couldn’t stay hidden behind the desk, however. Sooner or later, the machine would deduce that all it had to do was move over to one of their sides to fire away without interruptions.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Realizing the situation’s grimness, Anon concludes that he dreaded but knew needed to happen if they were to end the roomba takeover of Volcano High. It was a conclusion that terrified him, however…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Steeling himself and gritting his teeth, Anon grabs Lucy by the shoulder. “We don’t have much time or much choice,” he starts, grabbing hold of his wife’s hand and placing upon her palm the same USB stick Reed had given him in the previous floor. The human then leans in and kisses his wife passionately on the lips before hugging her as tight as he could. “Tell Amber that I love her,” he whispers into his wife’s ears as he breaks the embrace and stands up.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Before Lucy can even say a word, Anon stands up and shouts at the R.O.U.S, drawing its attention fully to him. Anon doesn’t even get a chance to step away too far from the desk before the R.O.U.S begins to fire in his direction.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“GET TO THE COMPUTER!” Anon shouts at Lucy as the paint pellets begin pelting his body, exploding in splashes of red; all the while, Anon screams in pain at every shot he receives.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Despite the tears forming in her eyes, Lucy heeds her husband’s words and hops over the desk. She rushes around the R.O.U.S, which momentarily stops pelting Anon with paintballs as it begins tracking Lucy’s movements past it. Lucy, however, pays it no mind, her full attention instead set on the computer terminal behind the automaton. Filled with nothing but pure determination, Lucy steps over the large roomba. She jumps up into the air, hovering past the machine and a sizable gap before landing right in front of the terminal controlling all the roombas in Volcano High.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">When the R.O.U.S can switch its targeting parameters to her, Lucy has already slammed the USB into one of the open computer slots. A big red ‘run’ prompt pops into the screen, and Lucy practically slams her fist down on the enter key.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">In less than a second, the code within Reed’s USB stick injects itself into the same data within the computer, overwriting whatever malicious programming had caused the roombas to go haywire. With one final whir of its motor, the R.O.U.S shuts down completely. As it does, all sounds save those coming from the server cases, once again leaving the school sounding eerily silent.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">With the roomba threat all but nullified, Lucy rushes to her husband’s side. She kneels next to the downed human and grabs onto his body. “A-Anon?” she whispers, gingerly rocking his body side to side, seemingly to no avail. “Anon!” Lucy shouts, grabbing on to her husband as tightly as she possibly can, all the while burying her face in his chest.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon lets out a single snort in reply to his wife’s actions. “Lucy, y-you’re a bit too melodramatic…” he whispers, all the while holding back the urge to wince in pain from the pressure Lucy’s putting on several sore spots on his body. ‘Oh yeah, some of those are going to bruise real soon,’ Anon muses as he tries not to think about how purple his chest and abdomen are going to be later.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Still quite emotional over the situation, Lucy wipes her tears off and helps Anon back to his feet while supporting him to stand straight. She gets a chance to look over Anon’s outfit, which is now more red than green or gray. As she did, she wondered to herself just how much washing she’d have to do to get all that paint off. Or if washing would even do anything at all. Still, Lucy discarded those thoughts at the relief that the nightmare was over. The so-called ‘roombasion’ was over.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon looks over at the now deactivated R.O.U.S, suddenly appreciating the silence far more than earlier. ‘Still, we lost far too much today,’ Anon ponders somberly as he recalls Reed’s fate earlier that morning…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Suddenly, a hand grasps Anon’s shoulder, causing him to turn back in shock. The hand is attached to a paint-covered pink raptor, one that looks like he got the world’s worst cow licking from a vacuum all over his hair and clothes.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hey, bro!” Reed exclaims wearily, all the while also nursing sore spots where he no doubt got pelted with paintballs. “Looks like my kill switch worked! Awesome…” He lets out a wince and leans against the nearest solid surface, in this case, one of the servers.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Reed!” Anon exclaims as he rushes forward to hug his friend. “I thought those little monstrosities got you!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed chuckles as he motions to his body. “Oh, those little suckers tried their best, but I was just too slippery for ‘em!” He lets out a wince as he rubs his chest. “Still got me pretty good tho. Never want to see the underside of a roomba ever again…”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon’s only reply is to laugh alongside his buddy. Lucy, meanwhile, can only roll her eyes and giggle.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">The Mous matriarch allows her jubilation to naturally end before turning her attention to the still deactivated R.O.U.S. In particular, to its grafted paintball gun. “Okay, fess up. Whose bright idea was it to strap paintball lunches on the roombas?” She turns to face Anon. “Was it you?”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon and Reed look at each other before shaking their heads. “Wasn’t any of us, honest,” Anon answers with just as much confusion in his voice as his wife.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed, still wincing with every step, walks up to the main terminal within the IT room and begins typing, sifting through the code in the system for a possible answer. After about a minute, the raptor’s eyes go wide. “Uh, Anon… you gotta come and take a look at this…”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon heeds his friend's advice and steps forward, standing next to him as Reed points to various pieces of code displayed on the computer screen. “You seeing what I’m seeing?” Reed asks, all the while pointing at multiple pieces of code that just don’t seem to make any kind of sense for its intended purpose.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon takes a closer look. Even someone as computer illiterate as himself could tell that something was very wrong with the code. It almost looked liked…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Someone sabotaged the coding,” Reed and Anon speak in unison. They both step away from the computer, not quite sure what to make of the discovery they had just made…</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">--- --- ---</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Across from Volcano High, atop the rooftop of a nearby two-story apartment complex, a particular purple raptor stood by, a smile spread across their lips.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">While angry that their plan had been foiled before Monday rolled around, they are at least content that, while the original plan to tear down Volcano High had failed, they at least got a little bit of amusement at seeing Anon get so beat up by yet another of their stupid decisions.</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">The purple raptor laughs as they come up with another scheme to pull off next time. Perhaps something to do with their upcoming estrus season preparedness?</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“That’ll teach Anon and everyone to forget about my existence,” the purple raptor says as they turn around and leave the rooftop. “I’ll show them all what happens when they pretend that I was never there, to begin with!”</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">The purple raptor smiled wide. The age of anonymity was coming to an end. Soon, everyone would remember who they were:</div><div class="fanfic-line"></div><div class="fanfic-line">“Sage…” the raptor whispers, the grin on his lips only growing wider with each passing second...</div>
