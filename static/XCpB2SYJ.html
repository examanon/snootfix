A place where Fang could well and truly relax.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The aquarium</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I never would have suggested it if not for their half-off promo today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang's eyes lit up all the same when I mentioned it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As much as they could with how tired she looked</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Can't say I expected a woman like her to be excited over fish</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She still had that same sparkle when I pulled her out of the cab</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You're such a dweeb, Anon." Fang chuckles</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well, that's nothing new</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"What did I do to deserve that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang squeezes my hand, her talons digging into my hand just enough to be uncomfortable. Was I really still holding it!?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I let her hand drop to her side, the heat rising in my cheeks</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Uh, sorry. Got a little distracted."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I could tell, you were mumbling." Fang inclines her head. "What's on your mind?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fish?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Uh huh." Fang crossed her arms but she smiles nonetheless. "Well, at least we're at the right place for it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>We really were, the Volcadera Bluff aquarium was a truly massive building</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Guess that's the benefit of a coastal city</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stepping through the doors blasts me with A/C so chilly I was suddenly jealous that Fang was wearing her jacket</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I don't think I've seen her without it since I bought it for her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Considering it was nearly summer she had to have been suffering, it was way too hot for leather.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Still, it paid off here</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Looking around revealed there was a surprising amount of people, I never really expected a place as 'boring' as an aquarium to have so many visitors</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe Fang was onto something? Can't say I'd ever gone here before</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Had enough of fish during my stay in the navy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Why'd you want to come here so bad, anyway?" I asked absentmindedly, staring at the massive tanks that made up the walls of this room</div><div class="fanfic-line">>My question went unanswered, Glancing back to my side proved that Fang was no longer there</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Thankfully it wasn't to difficult to track a monochromatic weirdo through the crowd, her pale plumage stood out quite a bit</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was standing in front of a plaque with pictures and facts about the fish in the tanks</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Anything interesting?" I ask, stepping beside her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Mostly just refreshing myself" she answers with a quick glance my way before returning to the plaque</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You really like this stuff" I state rather than ask</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Mhm!" Fang agrees enthusiastically. "Did you know the Clownfish isn't actually immune to the anemone's sting? They just hurt themselves every single day until they can handle it better than the other fish."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Can't say I knew that, no." I say, taken aback by just how excited she was to share that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It really wasn't that long ago that Fang would barely talk to me, let alone share morbid fish facts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe I was just getting old, it had been a fair few months since we reconnected</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Any other interesting facts?" I ask, hoping for something a little more normal</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Well" Fang trails her nail across the plaque. "There are these parasites that make crabs transgender, I thought that was neat"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fucking what?" What the hell is wrong with nature?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I lean over her shoulder to inspect the plaque, surely that can't be real</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You won't find it here, that's something I learned myself." Fang mentions, unable to keep the grin from her face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Okay, but WHY did you learn that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The ptero shrugs, what's left of her wings ruffling with the motion</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I just like this kind of stuff I guess"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fang the rockstar marine biologist." I remark, impressed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I'm hardly either of those things." She tried to downplay the compliment but her smile revealed how she truly felt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"What started all this anyway?" I lean forward to get a better look, tapping on the glass "I don't remember you talking about trans crabs back in school"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Don't tap the glass, Anon." She said, slapping my hand away</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I turn to glare at her but her eyes are unfocused, a wistful smile on her face</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It was a little while after we broke up. I snuck out of the house and just started wandering one night. Ended up here." She seems to find herself and grins at me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I broke in, I don't even remember why. I think I just wanted to do something I shouldn't, or do something that most people wouldn't. I scribbled some nasty shit on the walls and knocked over some trash cans but it didn't really make me feel better."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So it was just me and the fish." Fang clacks her nails against the plaque. "The lights were out but the aquarium was lit enough that I could read, So I did. Learning about all these fish and how they lived their lives, all the little routines and habits they do to survive. I dunno, it made me feel a little better about my own I guess."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She smiles and points at a pufferfish swimming by "Plus, they're really cute."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I don't know if I shared the sentiment, A pufferfish that's not living up to it's name just looks kind of deflated. I did want to feed it a carrot though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"C'mon, I'll show you my favorite room." Fang says quickly, tugging me after her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I might just be crazy but I think she was a little embarrassed about her story</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She definitely knew where she was going at least, we rushed past a variety of exhibits</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Past the stingray tank, a handful of children splashing the water</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Past the tunnel that lead through a gigantic tank, the shadow of a whale shark dimming it temporarily</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Past an open door to some kind of stage, I could hear a crowd cheering and some employee talking about dolphins from the other side.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Finally Fang found where she was going</div><div class="fanfic-line">>wherever it was, it was nearly pitch black but she didn't seem too bothered</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I wonder if ptero's had better night vision than humans?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>We rounded a muddled corner, indistinct in the tenebrous gloom</div><div class="fanfic-line">>and suddenly motes of light like stars in the night sky lit up the room</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They were mostly pinks and purples, lighting up a crowd somehow bigger than in the foyer</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Their shirts were glowing in the dim light, Stepping into the room proper revealed that my undershirt did as well</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Distracted as I was, I didn't even notice that Fang had disappeared again</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now that everything was shaded in the same faded hues, finding her wasn't anywhere near as easy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I muscled my way through the crowds trying to find her, despite the volume of people there was barely a low murmur of conversation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I didn't really want to break it by shouting her name, even I'm not that awkward</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Why the hell did she bring me all the way here to show me something if she was just going to disappear!?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I huff, staring at the various exhibits</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Well fine, if she wanted me to look at them then I might as well</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'd probably find her faster doing that than sifting through a crowd</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe she'd even find me, A skinny is hard to miss in Volcadera Bluff</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Why was this city so racially segregated anyways?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's kind of lonely sometimes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'd been staring at fish for a few minutes and I was already this lost in thought?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The fish were flitting about, uncaring of the world outside their tank</div><div class="fanfic-line">>each one of them fluorescent in the lighting of this room</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The light seemed to amplify the natural color for some and in others it changed entirely</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They were really quite beautiful, I can see why Fang liked this room the most</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The next exhibit over had some interesting fish</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I swear the natural markings looked like letters but I had to be seeing things</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Surely</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A crab scuttled along the sand, waving its claws at me. It almost looked like it was pointing at something</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Pointing at the woman next to me, wow, she blew the fish out of the water</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I've never seen a meteor dodger with patterns that vibrant</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Or wings that small</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Wait, Fang!?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It had to be, she was wearing the same jacket with the holes cut in the back</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Any other ptero would have bought a jacket with their wings in mind rather than having to jury rig something</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Hardly monochromatic anymore, Fang was covered in the most vibrant shade of teal I've ever seen</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Crescent moons patterned the tattered remains of her wings, her iconic cheek marks had lit up beneath the light leaving literal sparkles in her eyes. A luminous diamond adorned her forehead and stomach, amplifying her natural beauty. How did she never talk about this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang didn't seem to notice me, enthralled by the exhibit as she was</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her shoulders were relaxed, eyes lidded with the smallest of smiles gracing her features</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I could see her eyes slowly following the path of the fish and they swam about</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Whether she realized it or not, I think this was something she needed</div><div class="fanfic-line">>For the first time in a long time, Fang looked at peace.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Since we've reunited I had seen her furious, excited, even playful.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'd seen her depressed nearly every day</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But in this moment Fang wasn't anyone or anything. She was simply lost in her blue dream</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I didn't want to interrupt her but we couldn't stay here forever</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Besides, I didn't want her to catch me staring</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fang?" I murmur over the gentle hum of the crowd</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her eyes found mine but she didn't seem too surprised to see me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Hey Anon" she said softly, her attention returning to the tank</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She didn't seem to be in any rush to leave</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I guess we could stay here a little longer</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I rubbed my arms, I swear they kept this room colder than the others and it was already chilly before</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Still, I persevered. Whatever this was seemed important to Fang</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After a while I stopped paying attention to the fish</div><div class="fanfic-line">>pretty as they were, I was much more interested in the woman beside me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>These new patterns of hers were stunning, It's incredible to think they were there the entire time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If she noticed my gawking, she didn't comment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Just as my feet were starting to ache from standing around so long, Fang spoke up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Thanks for this, Anon." She whispered despite us being among the few people left</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Feel any better?" I ask, that was the whole point of this after all</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She takes a deep breath before responding, "I think I realized something"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Oh?" I cant stop the curosity leaking into my voice</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah, I'm really fucking tired." She groans, slumping her shoulders</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I can see the bags under her eyes even in the dim light</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I'll bet. When was the last time you slept?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Uh..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yeah, that figures</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Why don't we go find a bench?" I offer</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang nods gratefully, navigating the dark effortlessly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I sigh happily once I'm off my feet, the tired ptero slumps into the seat next to me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I shiver again, why the hell did they keep this place so-</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Cold?" Fang interrupts my thoughts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"That obvious, huh?" I smile sheepishly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Lucky you're soft too" She mumbles</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Before I can ask what she means, her wing wraps around my shoulder and rests her head in the crook of my neck</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I don't even know how to react, What do I say? What do I do?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Indecision paralyzes me until finally I ask, "Fang?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The only response is the gentle rise of her chest, Just how long had it been since she let herself rest?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After so long In the dark I was starting to feel tired myself, The brilliant markings on her plumage were entrancing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I could feel my eyelids droop but those glowing symbols of hers gave me an idea</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She wanted to stand out as much as possible for her performance at the festival</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe to her they were mundane, something she had grown up with her entire life</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But to me they were the most gorgeous things I'd ever seen</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I had a feeling anyone else that saw them would feel the same</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'd bring it up with her later, There's not a chance in hell I'd wake her up now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Slowly, hesitantly, I let my head rest against her own</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I was glad she had started growing her hair again, It was incredibly soft</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With a deep breath I let my tired eyes rest</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang smelled like shampoo and cheap cigarettes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I took another breath, that's not creepy. Right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I guess we could stay here a little longer</div>
