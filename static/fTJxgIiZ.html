You'll beat me someday"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Maybe" he added with a chortle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He followed that by taking a swig of his drink.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ah, that's right Ridley caught on to my mumbling.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I had forgotten that. Actually now that I think about it, a lot of the people in my life caught on to it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">My secret exposed, hidden knowledge forever gone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Felt nice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Getting your ass kicked feels nice, bro?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed takes a huge handful of his loaded fries and stuffs them into his mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He actually used his hand for that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Something about getting used to it maybe, like a fetish" Nasar quips.</div><div class="fanfic-line">That gets a chuckle out of the room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">All 4 of us were sitting around the dinner table eating food and playing connect 4. Waiting on whatever it was to start.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So run this by me again" I asked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I popped a chip in my mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why do we need to be here and our other halves elsewhere?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Because that's how it's done, always has been probably always will be" Naser decreed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Right but like, what exactly happens?" Reed still had food in his mouth</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I don't see the big deal, it's just another night" I said aloud</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ridley and Naser looked at each other for a moment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's...better you find out on your own" Ridley shifted in his seat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Trying to explain it never really works out"</div><div class="fanfic-line">He looked very uncomfortable talking about this</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Look son, just go with the flow."</div><div class="fanfic-line">That last part seemed more like a command.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I opened my mouth to protest when a door opened</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh dear let them wonder some more, it's a special night after all."</div><div class="fanfic-line">The matriarch herself enters, with more food and drink.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Weird, she also mallet on the tray.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Must be for some meal prep.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, did you take your medicine yet?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">As she sets down the tray I fumble with the pill bottle in my jacket pocket.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh right, I should probably get on that." I look at the label.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Better take it now, your doctor did say about an hour beforehand."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her smile was bright, still able to get what she wanted.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"right"</div><div class="fanfic-line">I open the bottle and pull out a pill. It was a rather large pill.</div><div class="fanfic-line">An hour before what though, like I get the general idea of what happens. Sexy time with Fang. Big deal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">We've been married almost a year now so I know how to handle her. Everyone is making such a fuss like it's our wedding night.</div><div class="fanfic-line">My face warms a bit from that memory. I don't think anyone noticed. I hope not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thinking back on it, this was our first time together for this holiday though. Back in high school I wasn't allowed to see her and during my college years she made sure I never visited around now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hell, even my doctor was being weird. Fang had told me to go get checked over to make sure I was healthy and all that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">So I went. My doctor was a strong built ankylosaur. Nice shade of yellow on her scales.</div><div class="fanfic-line">When I asked about Estrus Season she was evasive, something about how it should be felt and not told or other such bullshit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">After all the poking and prodding was done she handed me the medicine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Take this about an hour before, with food".</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then more sternly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't forget, bad things could happen else".</div><div class="fanfic-line">I remember looking at her with a skeptical face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Else what?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">She just shook her head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fine then, what's in it?".</div><div class="fanfic-line">She then proceeded to rattle off names with more syllables than should be legal and finally ended with.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Humans don't have an estrus season, so your body won't be able to handle it without this".</div><div class="fanfic-line">She looks me straight in the eye.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Do not Forget."</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could only nod.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Good, now go enjoy the night".</div><div class="fanfic-line">She had such a shit eating grin about it too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That pill is huge" Reed commented.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Taking me right out of memory lane.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yea, it must be nice not to have to take it." Looking at the clock it was still a few minutes before 11, but I don't think it needed to be on the dot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Water, pill, and down it went.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed shrugged, it was his first time too in this. Somehow he had managed to avoid romance for most of his years and just "vibe with the world", his words not mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It wasn't until he and Trish got together about last year that changed. Turns out they made a pretty healthy couple, if you can believe it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish initiated it I think, grabbed him by the neck and kissed him one night we were all hanging out. I was so surprised I thought she was trying to eat him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">In a way she was.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I think they might have always had a thing for each other.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The things that happen in life can be amazing, I ponder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Have you heard anything from Lucy, Anon?" Naser was checking his own phone while asking</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Not yet" I reply, looking at my own.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed does the same.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Nothing from Trish".</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh don't worry boys, they have things that need to be taken care of." Samantha reassured us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">And to kill any further questions she added.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Lady things that need addressing".</div><div class="fanfic-line">Samantha moved around the table, cleaning up trash and clearing dishes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I moved to help but she waved me down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I got it dear".</div><div class="fanfic-line">A saint as always, the way everyone was talking it seemed like all the females would be going crazy tonight.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh as you get older you don't get as wild" She looked my way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Mumbling you betrayed me again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I noticed Ridley shifted in his seat when she said that last part.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Was that relief on his face?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just then the grandfather clock chimed 11 PM.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Everyone looked up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Big old thing, I remember seeing it when I first came by Fang's house, all those years ago.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Time to get going" Naser said</div><div class="fanfic-line">He got out of his seat, everyone else followed suit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">As we made for the door Ridley cleared his throat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright then, everyone be safe and don't do anything stupid".</div><div class="fanfic-line">He looked my way and put his hand on my shoulder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, you may be married to my daughter but if I hear bad things from her, your ass is still mine". His grip tightened.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Some things never change.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Right" I coughed out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Damn his talons still hurt like hell.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come one, let's go, if we take too long...".</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser trailed off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"He's right boys, get going. It's not polite to keep ladies waiting".</div><div class="fanfic-line">Samantha started to shepherd us out the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was then that I noticed her face was red, and her neck too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She seemed to catch my concerned look.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on now, get out".</div><div class="fanfic-line">She said that with some pretty heavy oomph.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her eyes were... sharp, very focused.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like a hunter being interrupted during her kill.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ridley turned toward her with a look of fear.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The last thing I saw before she shut the door was the mallet in her hands.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The last thing I heard was the sound of the lock on the door going into place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The last thing I felt was vibrations, of something heavy running. Followed by something lighter chasing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">That was....concerning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why the mallet?</div><div class="fanfic-line">As if reading my mind Naser spoke up not even turning his head</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Let's go and don't worry about it. Dad can handle himself".</div><div class="fanfic-line">He was very calm about this, even though I feel like I would get a little sick from the thought of my folks going at it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He started walking and Reed looked at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He shrugged.</div><div class="fanfic-line">With that we followed him to the Nascar, not saying anything. Once we hopped in he started out the driveway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I think I just heard a door slam somewhere in the house.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then again maybe not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser pulls onto the road and takes off at his usual speed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was then I noticed his phone started buzzing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We've been driving for about 20 minutes at this point.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Other than Nasers phone vibrating the entire time not much was said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Bro, aren't you going to pick that up" Reed asked eventually.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naser shook his head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I know who's calling".</div><div class="fanfic-line">Makes one of us at least.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He looked at us from his rear view mirror.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"My girlfriend," He finally said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Are you guys fighting then?"  Reed fumbled with his own phone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We're fine, she's just... in a mood. Because of tonight you know".</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed's phone suddenly rang, he had a song from the old band as a ringtone, Cute.</div><div class="fanfic-line">They still jam together every now and then. They have gotten a lot better too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He answered it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Trish hey....no we are on the way...yea I-.... yea sure. Uh Anon is here too".</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could only hear her tone and not the actual words, but she seemed normal enough.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Same old loud Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"....Ok see you soon. Love you too" Reed said that last part a little quieter. Then ended the call.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Awww, to be in love.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Everything good?" I asked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed looked at me and shrugged.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yea, she just wanted to know where we were and stuff"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just then my phone started ringing. I checked the caller. It was Fang...</div><div class="fanfic-line">Did my heart just skip a beat?</div><div class="fanfic-line">I answered, "Hey Fang what's up?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Just checking to make sure you're on your way," She said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Holy fuck was her voice always this sweet?</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You picked up that box of condoms right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">We had stopped by the gas station on the way home. She wanted me to pick up a big box.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yea I have them. Are you feeling ok?" I ask.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Do you mean if I'm some sex crazed maniac?" she nearly laughed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The thought had crossed my mind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm fine, hurry up and get home it's almost midnight."</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang sounded normal just like Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We'll be there in a few minutes" I looked out the window to see where we were.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Was my palm getting sweaty?</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Good, see you then. Love you" she whispered that last part.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Love you too" I answered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The call ended, she had hung up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">My heart did skip a beat that time for sure hearing "Love you"</div><div class="fanfic-line">I really really wanted to see Fang....</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuck is in this medicine?</div><div class="fanfic-line">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div class="fanfic-line">As we stepped out from the Nascar into the driveway of our home, Naser wished us luck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You'll need it" is all he said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before Reed or I could say anything back he sped off in his usual manner.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Though I will admit it was a bit faster than normal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I think his phone was still buzzing," I mentioned to Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">In fact it had not once stopped during our ride here. Though he did send a few texts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Guess his girlfriend really wanted to talk to him about tonight".</div><div class="fanfic-line">I think Reed was trying to ease the tension in the air, but for the life of me Naser sure looked ..Focused.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I should be concerned by that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean even for a med student those eyes were laser focused.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He's been with this girl for a while, for sure even during Estrus Season.</div><div class="fanfic-line">...I still couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish and Fang were "getting ready" together. I think the plan was for Reed to head out with Trish back to their place. Our home had been closer so it just made things easier to do it here, Fang had said.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Turning back to our house everything looked calm enough.</div><div class="fanfic-line">No lights on but other than that...</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh, don't know what I was expecting" Reed chimed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't either, it was just another night I suppose when you really get down to it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fang sounded fine on the phone, maybe we are just getting taken for a ride?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed looked at me, rolled his eyes and shrugged.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Guess it was my turn for a joke to fall flat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, I did notice a small smirk. Bros to the end.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thinking back to the last few hours.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The way that Samantha acted on our way out of the home.</div><div class="fanfic-line">That and Ridley's face once she told us to "get out".</div><div class="fanfic-line">There was the issue of all the running that I heard too...</div><div class="fanfic-line">All this build up for something that happens yearly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm worrying too much, Fang sounded perfectly in control on the phone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Definitely not like some hormone crazed dino goth wife.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I was kind of disappointed in a way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I was also worrying too much...</div><div class="fanfic-line">Go home Anon, go home to your perfect wife and enjoy the holiday.</div><div class="fanfic-line">With that we walked up the steps and I unlocked the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was dark inside, what with there being no lights on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Also really quiet, like dead silent.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What, you don't have lights in your house bro? Should look into them, pretty cool"</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course we do, you've been over lots of times" I reply trying to flip a light switch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">What is the bulb gone or something?</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look inside... it actually was gone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Alarms start to go off in my head, did someone break in?</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is Fang Ok? Is Trish?</div><div class="fanfic-line">I see Reed get a worried look too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">We hurry into the living room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed Calles out for Trish, I Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">There was no reply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I think it's fair to say I was starting to panic a little.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I had just talked to Fang what, 10 minutes ago on the phone?</div><div class="fanfic-line">My mind was racing. What could have happened?</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's when I noticed it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The change was subtle I'll admit, a shift in movement. The soft sound of breathing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Right on the edge of hearing, in that zone where you're not sure if it was real or not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">As if on command with that thought, a lamp flicked to life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Revealing 2 figures standing behind us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">We turned, and I swear Reed's jaw dropped wider than I've ever seen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I should know, mine did too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Standing in the light was Fang and Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thank Raptor Jesus, they were healthy and not ax murdered as feared.</div><div class="fanfic-line">What was not expected was the lingerie they had chosen to wear for the occasion.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Frilly underwear from an expensive brand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Familiar actually, like I've seen them wear it before somewhere.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Which is impossible since I've never seen them together in their underwear of course</div><div class="fanfic-line">I also noticed that I could see my wifes markings.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The kind that I needed a black light to see.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I should be curious about that, but right now I didn't seem to mind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fan-" I start to stammer before being cut off by sudden movement.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish had lunged toward Reed, tackling him to the ground as he yelped.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was fast, precise, terrifying.</div><div class="fanfic-line">He was pinned flat on his back and she was on top.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish had a wicked smile on her face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Red along her face and neckline.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her breathing heavy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Pure lust in her eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">All targeted towards Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She gave him a quick kiss on the lips.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I think she might have snuck a bite in there as well.</div><div class="fanfic-line">That looked like it hurt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before Reed could even speak, before he could do anything, she grabbed his tail and dragged him toward the guest bedroom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Knocking over a corner table with his flailing body.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She quickly turned the corner and went inside, Reed managed to grab onto the door frame and looked at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could only see his head and arms holding him in place. In his eyes I saw a myriad of emotions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fear, Surprise, confusion and....bliss?</div><div class="fanfic-line">I swear he gave me a shit eating grin before He was pulled in and the door slammed shut.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The entire assault could have only been a few seconds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How did-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before I could finish I felt 2 taloned hands grab me by the shoulders.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I spun to see Fang within inches of my face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her lovely Snoot right by my lips. I could feel her breathing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Those Eyes locked into mine. Beautiful amber eyes, starlight in living form.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like Trish, she moved quickly; Unlike Trish it was silent and graceful. I should have been shocked, maybe a little scared.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Right now however, the feeling was something else.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still I should have seen her coming.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe the medicine had something to do with it, maybe not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then it clicked, the pieces falling into place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish moved first to throw my attention from Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">With my gaze shifted Fang simply moved into striking range.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Clever girl, I never even stood a chance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Got you" she whispered. Low and full of seduction.</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yea, you do" was all I managed out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She did after all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">-----------------------</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To say that Fang had me dead to rights was pretty accurate.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her hands were tight, but then slackened.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I took the chance to wrap my own around her waist, brought her in close, and did the only thing that was on my mind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I kissed her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sweet Raptor Jesus I kissed her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her body was hot, radiating heat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could feel myself getting pretty warm too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">When we finally parted, leaving a trail of saliva between, Fang grabbed my hand and interlocked fingers with mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I should mention that her face had that same reddish pink hue her mom had. It went down her neckline and on her chest. Her breasts were also red, and a bit fuller may I add.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She turned toward the stairs, to our bedroom and with our hands still locked together made a run for it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I ran with her with all my heart.</div><div class="fanfic-line">We made it up the stairs and through the door leading into our room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">We crashed on the bed kissing and flailing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even a giggle or two was heard.</div><div class="fanfic-line">My shirt came off before I fully landed, shoes and socks flying in opposite directions not long after. Also my pants were gone at some point, though I don’t remember when.</div><div class="fanfic-line">This medicine was doing something to me and I think I figured it out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don’t think I would survive the night without it. It was probably doing something to my body to make me more...viable for the holiday.</div><div class="fanfic-line">The only thing I had left was my boxers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I went to take off Fangs...outfit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I expected the top to have some sort of hook or clip but it just popped off, ease of access.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I liked that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She removed the rest with a swift motion and mounted me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her full glory was visible, time slowed down a bit and I took in the view.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I see now why no one wanted to talk about tonight, you really did just have to experience it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">A thought than popped into my mind, I reached down into my jacket on the floor and pulled out the box of condoms</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fang wait” I said, holding up the box.</div><div class="fanfic-line">She gave a deep loving smile.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You remembered, good boy,” she purred.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then she slapped the box right out of my hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“But no” The package went flying into the wall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It exploded, it’s guts flying out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">It slumped to the floor, dead.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Oh” I looked into those Amber eyes again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I see, she never really wanted them. Just another thing to make sure I didn't run. I don’t think there was enough in the box for tonight anyways.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Who would ever run from this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">“You’d be surprised” She leaned in and grabbed my face. Bringing hers in closer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“The stories mom told me about what it took to catch dad” She kissed me before I could ask for specifics.</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't have the breath to talk after that regardless.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">-------------------------------------------------------</div><div class="fanfic-line">More to come...</div>
