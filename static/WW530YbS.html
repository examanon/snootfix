                    <div class="fanfic-line">Chapter 3</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Remind me again why I'm here?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">["Stella"]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Haha, to wish I was still there, of course."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I keep staring in the mirror, waiting for the joke to get funnier.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It doesn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a look at my phone, probably for the hundredth time in the last hour. She still hasn't seen my message.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">God, what the fuck is the time in France? Waiting for her to come online is always the worst.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For the fear that eventually she'll turn from "Stella" to "Stella, last seen online way too fucking long ago".</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a sigh I turn from the unshaven scruffy face that is now my reflection, and return to the main room, to my laptop.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's cold autumn rain pattering on the window, the only sound that keeps me company.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, that's not entirely correct. There's also an electric heater I bought, filling the room with a constant low buzzing. But I don't even notice it anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I often wondered if there actually is going to be heating in the building during the winter - what, with barely a month till sub-zero temperatures would hit. It was a coin toss really, here in Skin Row.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like most nights, to pass the time I've been reading an ebook called "Interspecies relationships for dummies". Either that, or endlessly shuffling a deck of cards that I have no use for.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The book more or less details how to deal with dinos as a human, like if you tried to date a carnivore. There were some more interesting tidbits in there too, for example how to - or how not to - start human-dino family.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Basically, a human can't knock a dino up under normal circumstances. Which was good to know, like half a year into a relationship with one. There were omniceptives, and it allegedly also had a slim chance of happening during the peak of estrus.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well actually, according to this thing it varied between species. Male dinos also had better chances at human girls, cause they were fertile all year long.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Furthermore, STDs were supposedly impossible to pass to a member of the other species.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fascinating.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Such were the facts I came to know as the year progressed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I had some notions of what the time difference between our timezones should be, but it wasn't all that easy to coordinate these conversations. Stella had all kinds of family events and work-related appearances to make, so it was usually me sitting on my bum, waiting for her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Truth be told, I wasn't at all looking forward to today's talk. These latter ones felt only a few shades short of an interrogation, trying to get anything out of Stella. Which was, well, pretty awkward.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It wasn't like she didn't want to talk to me. Only that it was mostly her babbling about anime and stuff. I mean I guess that's her main area of interest, it was more like... Not a conversation I'd have with someone I'm dating.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Plus I'm working a morning shift tomorrow. I'll be lucky if I can get in six hours of sleep, if that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Murmuring obscenities to myself, I reach for my mug of instant coffee and start to idly scroll through previous messages.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Geez, it's really been a week since we last talked? Wow, I couldn't have called that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And almost another since the time before that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait, no. That was only me asking if she's gonna come online to no answer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I scroll up more and more, rewinding months in my head. When did things get this bad, really?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Scroll, scroll.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Scroll, scroll.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a click I stop at a random spot, a few weeks into the summer apparently. Like just after we've graduated.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ugh, I guess more like after Stella had graduated.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Having been severely beat up just a couple of short months prior has put me at a pretty big disadvantage. I could barely attend classes due to quote un-quote suspected cranial trauma.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">First I thought that was the nurse's way of calling me a dumbass, but no. I've had really bad migraines in the first few weeks. They eventually went away, but I had to excuse myself from school often. It was bad.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even when I could attend class, I didn't really want to. Trish enacted a personal vendetta against me, trying to get me into any and all sort of trouble she could think of. These almost exclusively backfired on her, at least the real far-fetched ones, but it was enough to make me not want to show my face in public.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella tried to shore up the damage, going out of her way to pick up my daily homework and bringing it over to my place. All that accomplished was an ever-growing stack of papers collecting dust on my desk. In the beginning I've tried my best to finish them all, if only for her sake, but I soon found that missing half your classes means that you'll have no idea what the curriculum is remotely about.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Unsurprisingly, I've ended up failing both chem and math, along with music.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah music, for real.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't even begin to describe the shame I've felt about that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wasn't the only one who had to retake his last year though. Fang was just as miserable as me, if not more so. I've only heard rumors, but I think she had to see a psychiatrist twice a week. She also started wearing long-sleeved shirts - in the summer -, which was a clear indicator that she started preening and-or cutting herself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Now that was really fucking fucked up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">None of us attended prom either. I've felt - and still feel - like an asshole about that. I knew it would have been special to Stella. She may have acted like it's no big deal, that it was a smart thing to not bring the drama there, but... It's a once in a lifetime event, and because of me she had to miss it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My parents were hysterical about the whole ordeal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Dad threatened to disown me, and I can only surmise that it took a week of begging by Mom to get him to change his mind. They cut off the money all the same.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As such, I had to get a job. Pronto. I didn't have any marketable skills, so, cashier's life for me. Thankfully there were about a dozen run-down shitty liquor stores in the area, one of them had to eventually take me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To a certain extent having an income of my own meant that I could splurge on Stella, who, against all odds sticked with me. She was adamant that we were gonna have a nice summer together.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And uh, we kinda did.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At least in the beginning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Kinda.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Scrolling through some of the conversations from back then, a particular one catches my attention.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's from before I told my parents about my failure, and way before Stella moved to France.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"hey sweeite <3"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"how was your day?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've grown used to being called sweetie by then, though I remember smiling like a retard every time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"it was ok hbu"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She typed for a while, then paused, then typed again, repeating this process only to stop altogether and call me instead.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I took a second to pick up, alarms going off in my head left and right. I knew that whatever it was, it definitely wouldn't be good.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"H-hey?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Silence.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Met with Dad today."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't really know what that meant back then. Her dad? Like, that raised so many questions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Was it just a quick visit or something? They didn't live nearby or else Stella wouldn't have had to live in the dorms. In fact, what was gonna happen to her now that she's graduated? Was that what their meeting was about? Was she gonna move home?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I figured she could move in with me, but I could see why she wouldn't want to. Skin Row wasn't a nice place to live in, to say the least. Especially for a young female, and a dino at that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, shouldn't I have been there? I mean, I haven't had the chance to meet her parents till then, so what gives?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh-huh... So um, that's nice?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her sigh was audible even through the phone lines. I could practically see her troubled expression.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ugh, no, Anon, it really wasn't. Dad's a total dick."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Then why did you--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I had to, okay? Believe me, I wouldn't have if there was any other way. That's why I didn't ask you to come, cause he's this..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ugh, he's just a big jerkoff, alright?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hearing Stella swear was something new. I've maybe only heard her badmouth someone during the whole Fang-fiasco, but that was it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Is he really that bad?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another long pause.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'll tell you tomorrow, okay? I super promise."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I just don't want to do this over the phone."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was then my turn to sit in silence.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There was clearly a story there, and apparently it was a big fucking deal. I was dying to know what could have gotten so wrong between the two of them that she wouldn't even want to see her own father.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Back then we never really had an awkward silence like the one that followed. I guessed that was good a time as any to bring up the parent thing on my end.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I took a deep breath, bracing myself for the conversation that was ought to follow. I remember being stressed about the situation, and not really knowing why.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, Stella is a smart girl - kind of -, so she must have had some pretty good guesses about my situation. It wasn't like some Earth-shattering news, disappointing my parents.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As a fellow weeb retard, she surely had some experience with being a disappointment. Then again it wasn't every day you fail your last year of high school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was more like, what was gonna happen to us? I'd have to stay here for one more year at a minimum, while she should have gone to college. There were a few in the area, but... We've never really talked about that stuff. I didn't even know what she wanted to study.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can recall very clearly how suddenly I felt like I knew so very little about Stella. As if I've been too preoccupied with the relationship itself, rather than the person I was in a relationship with. If that makes any sense.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before I could muse on that for long, Stella's voice brought me back to reality.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Guess what I'm wearing!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Clothes?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Haha, Anon, that was a terrible guess!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wanna see?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, who cared about all that existential dread when there was dino tiddy to be had? Some may have seen college in their futures, but I saw a pair of shapely yellow breasts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hell yeah!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She giggled at my enthusiastic response, and I could just about imagine her blushing, tail curling up on her leg.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Afterwards Stella dropped the call, and I took the opportunity to swiftly grab a tissue, hopping into bed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her message couldn't come soon enough.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just as I considered if I was being left blue balled - again - the pic arrived, and oh my.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Although I was expecting full frontal nudity, the picture instead depicted Stella's back from shoulder level, laying down on her bed and surrounded by her armada of plushies.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The picture made it very clear that she wasn't wearing any clothes though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To this day, I swear if I zoom in hard enough I can maybe see a hint of her boobies from the side.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The shit-eating smirk on her face said it all, complete with her tail covering up her juicy bits with cold dead precision.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What a damn tease.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, her curvy body was - and still is - more than enough to excite me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So much so that I immediately sent her a message, asking for more. My wish was granted pretty quick, as if she was anticipating this very event. I don't even know why but I found that idea kinda hot. Something something personal bad bitch something something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The second one, actually a short video, was of her butt - though still partially covered by her tail of course. This time she used one of her clawed hands to grab her meaty parts, jiggling them around playfully.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, what I wouldn't have given to be able to do that myself. Or bury my face in it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could seriously accept dying like that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Death by weeb ass.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't even need to ask for the third pic, and I was already greeted to a cute scaly tummy and pair of tastefully protruding pelvic bones.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"pick a direction ;)"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"up or down?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The message gives me a pleasant chuckle, and I almost spill my now cold coffee over my lap.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Damn.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I better not, these are my last good pants before I need to do the fucking laundry. Just another item on the list of things I've been putting off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Where was I...? Oh yeah.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Honestly, I was very glad that she included options cause at first I've had no idea what she meant. Wouldn't have been the first time I ruined the mood by being a retard. And horny. A horny retard.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"up"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"u rly like them that much? :$"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"tits or gtfo"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wow, Anon, what a playa you was in the past. Truly the way to woo a maiden. Well done.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thankfully I got another picture instead of being called a jerk, albeit still not of her breasts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To her credit she did move the camera upwards, and they were sort of in the frame, hidden under her arm. The smirk was replaced with a wink and childish stuck-out tongue.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Only then did I realize the subtle nip-slip between her fingers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"new fave"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"<3"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"prove it"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once again my brain needed a second to process that she probably didn't mean a three-hundred-word essay on the subject.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">While I was jerking it a little already, for the sake of the picture I put it back into my boxers. I remember wanting to play at the teasing game too, as a form of revenge.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"so big <3 <3"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My chest positively doubled in size with pride.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess it still feels good to read it even now too, but it doesn't cheer me up that much anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"4 u ;)"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">El oh el.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"aww but its so sad in ur pants"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"i hav a better place for it"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"fsgds"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"u gonna come?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Seems like Stella understood my predicament exactly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Past Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"make a mess for me <3 <3"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's a few minutes pause in the conversation, so I guess I really did come.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After that we just made plans to meet the next day, and "do it for real". Heh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My memories are kinda hazy, but I remember some stuff. Like, not the actual doing-it-for-real part, but the conversation about her dad, my dad, and what our future would look like.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or uh, what we wanted it to look like at the time. If only we knew...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a grunt I get up and take my still untouched mug of cold coffee to the kitchen. Figure I might as well reheat it, at least it'll give me something to do. With some luck I can even focus my thoughts on something less depressing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Try as I might, watching the slowly rotating beverage puts me into this numb robotic state where I can't help but recall those days.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's summer and I'm sitting in the grass near the beach.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The ground is warm, very comfortable.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Little blades of grass caress my palms playfully as the breeze picks up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The scent of the ocean on the wind, a bit salty maybe. The good kind of salty.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The sun is getting low, casting its long, shimmering reflection over the waves.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's one of those days when it can almost feel like summer is never going to end.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There are seagulls screeching in the distance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They're not annoying, more complimenting the noise coming from nearby vendors and the few groups of youth scattered around them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There aren't a lot of people out by now, guess the kids are getting bored of playing outside.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't really mind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Closing my eyes I bask in the glow, enjoying the warmth spreading around my body and seeping into my bones.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's a picnic basket next to me, filled with sandwitches I've made. I want to impress Stella, even if it's only a little something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It doesn't hurt to be nice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm currently waiting for her to make an appearance too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even if the topic we were about to discuss wasn't a jolly one, maybe we could have a date afterwards. I'm kinda excited to learn about her family though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've always imagined them as this token suburb-middle-class family, living some hundred miles away. Maybe her dad could have been this comic collector geek, and her mom could have been a writer. Or maybe a kindergarten teacher.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't know where I'm getting these specific ideas, I'm just looking for an explanation for Stella's bubbly demeanor and weird hobbies.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Opening my eyes again I scan the walkway by the shoreline, and sure as eggs and bacon, Stella is just appearing from behind a cotton-candy stall - surprisingly without having bought anything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's wearing a deep blue sundress, complete with a straw hat. She waves at me, and I wave back, a huge smile appearing on my face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As with the waves, a few of her scales reflect the waning sunshine, making it look like her very being is emitting this pleasant, golden light.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's all so...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Perfect.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In this very moment, despite all uncertainly, I feel like I already know what I want our future to be: getting married.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We may barely be out of highschool - not even that on my end -, and maybe our relationship isn't even a year old, and frankly who cares if we haven't even said the L-word... In the here and now I wish I could have evenings like this for all the rest of my life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I tear my eyes from the scene, trying to gather my bearings.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like uh... Yeah okay.

It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm not sure what's with me today. I mean, we've had dates like this for a while now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe it's the calm before the storm cause I know hardships are coming. Or maybe it's the catharsis of finally not having to show my face at school, at least till summer is over.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't know. I just feel extra nice today, being here with Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Having made the realization just a day prior that I should put effort into getting to actually know Stella, I ask her about her favorite color, favorite movies, what kinda music she likes - other than anime OSTs -, and so on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Surprisingly, she has a soft spot for early 90's rappers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Afterwards we talk a bit more about nothing in particular, watching the setting sun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Its upper half is still visible on the horizon as Stella brings out the loaded gun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She clears her throat to get my attention, fixing her hat one last time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, there's this thing I wanna tell you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I get a little alarmed that she's using my name, but I don't pay it much heed.

It's obvious that reliving these memories must be painful for her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It was okay till Dad got into a bad crowd."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Like, I think some drug dealers or something.

The visage of Stella and the beach turns into a barely lit kitchen, the distant screeching of seagulls into the sounds of the rain, and the pleasant warmth of the sun into the nigh lukewarm room temperature my shitty heater can produce.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I get my coffee, reminding myself that the past is just that, the past. There's nothing I, or anyone else, can do about it now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With the help of caffeine I push the thoughts from my mind. Raptor Jesus has blessed me with a minor miracle, where my reheated beverage falls square in between annoyingly cold and tongue-burningly hot - just right for drinking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Really, this has to be the first thing to go my way this entire week.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Being slightly less irritated than I was before, I return to the living room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella still hasn't seen my message.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I consider sending her some bullshit excuse and calling it a night. Hell, I even consider just simply calling it a night without letting her know. Cause it's really starting to look like she isn't coming.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the end I dismiss the notion and slump into the seat, opening the next chapter of "Interspecies relationships for dummies".</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Dinner and toilet etiquette.

It's either my autism, or knowing that there's nothing I could do instead that would matter to anything anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's half past midnight.

Not back then anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe, just maybe, I should have known that Stella meeting her father was bad news. Him being a felon and whatnot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe I should have paid more attention to her saying she had no choice but to see him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Really, how did I not add one and two together? She could no longer stay in the dorms, but neither could she afford an apartment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With her father in jail, her mother was probably her lawful guardian or something. In France.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Which means that Stella's only option of staying was to get her father to, well, if not let her live with him, but at least to contribute to her renting someplace.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But seeing how bad their relationship was and Stella's reaction to meeting him, it should have been obvious that neither happened.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess I figured that she could live with me if she wanted, not thinking about inane things like "family" and "law" and "illegal migrant status".</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eventually, tiredness overtakes me and these fleeting memories cease to form any coherent thread.

In fact, come morning I manage to get out of bed a few minutes before my alarm would have gone off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It puts me into a surprisingly good mood, that for once I don't start the day stiff as a board.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The rain has let up too, and I decide to ride the feel-good-train long as I can, exchanging my morning round of shitposting in favor of a walk.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Part of my routine though that I don't skip is turning the top card up on my deck of cards, as if I could predict how my day was going to turn out. I never could, but maybe someday.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I consider checking my messages too, but that'll wait till I get home after work.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A quick shower, grabbing my phone, wallet, and keys, then out the door I am. My empty stomach protests at skipping breakfast, but I can probably get a hot-dog on my way to the store.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's a relatively short distance, though I usually opt for the bus. Fewer chances of getting stabbed, mugged, or both.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">However there shouldn't be many people out this early, so I can risk the walk today. The hobos and junkies are still sleeping, serial killers done with their shifts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I deliberately pay no mind to the shitty rundown quality of the building as I exit, trying to keep a good note.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's that unmistakable "cold smell" to the air. Like, the smell of smoke that doesn't normally fester in Skin Row combined with the musk of rotten leaves left on the road.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But it also has a unique sharpness to it. The kind you only feel stepping out into the cold.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">On other days I probably would grumble about it, but today it fills me with, well I don't know... Not exactly joy, but I find it nice nevertheless. Especially with the smell of rain painting it a pleasant undertone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I push any and all thoughts and worries away, trying to keep my head empty. It's a partial success as I manage to not focus on the whole Stella-thing, but the closer I get to my destination the more I feel like turning back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's only knowing that my livelihood is at stake that keeps me going.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As planned, I get a hot-dog from a decently not-shady-looking vendor. Fortunately, its meat content is also only decently questionable.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With still some time till my shift starts I take the luxury of sitting down in one of the few parks that litter Skin Row. It's all vandalized of course, and there are scores of homeless sleeping on the benches and between the bushes, but it'll make do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's a statue in the middle, depicting whoever-I-don't-care in a heroic pose, striking their stone banner. With all the damage the poor thing has suffered, I can't even tell if it's supposed to be a human or a dino. If there was a sigil on the banner in the past, it's gone now too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sitting there, chewing on my hot-dog, listening to the snoring and mumbling of hobos, it's strangely calming. Before I know it, my thoughts have already wandered back to the past...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm in a dark room, filled with people in strange clothes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's a masquerade.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I, too, have a costume on. An old military uniform with a bandana and eyepatch, complete with a half assed drawn-on goatee.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's music thumping from giant speakers, lights and lasers flashing every few seconds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel anxious, uneasy. Too many bodies around me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's Stella, dressed like a witch, beckoning me to go dance with her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't want to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't want to do anything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Our talk on the beach ended with Stella dropping the bomb about her having to go back to France.

I just...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't want to pull the plug and let her go, but I feel betrayed to say the least. The worst part is, I know it wasn't up to her so I shouldn't blame Stella but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't think I've felt this bad since Fang beat me up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This party we're at right now is supposed to be our last fun night together. A farewell party for the students moving out of the dorms this year.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm not sure why I've bothered to show.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Gripping my bottle of cheap beer, I let her drag me to the dance floor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Afterall, it doesn't really matter what I do. Nothing really matters anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, one thing maybe.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've bought a brand new deck of tarot cards for Stella. It's a cheesy one with anime figures on it, but she might like it. One personal touch I've added was replacing the Lovers with her old card, the one she tore in half.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was quite the adventure, tracking down which junkyard the school dumps its stuff to, and paying the right people so they'd let me rummage through it. It was a shot in the dark, truth be told.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But it was all worth it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'll give it to her tomorrow at the airport, with the hopes that I'll become her forget me not. It was a bit sappy, but I've wanted to make the gesture anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Meanwhile we've made it to the middle of the room, several bodies pressing up against ours, music so loud that I can barely hear myself think.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella seems to be in a good mood though, and we join the mass of writhing bodies. I absolutely don't know what I'm doing, but I've once read on a lithuanian welding-enthusiast internet forum that bobbing my knees to reload animations is good enough in a scenario like this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So that's what I end up doing for the next hour or so.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Every now and then a plastic canister is passed around the room, filled with some nondescript jungle juice that helps lift my unease.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The next thing I know we're in the bathroom with Stella, smooching up a storm.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm pushed into one of the stalls, and she gives me not a spare second before taking a dive towards my crotch.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Playing with my zipper she looks up at me, a coy smile on her full lips.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Eeyyyh, ya gat a dolla'?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait, that's not Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's a hobo standing before me, reaching his dirty hand in my face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My first impulse would be to shove it away with a flurry of obscenities.

It would be better if I didn't know he was gonna blow it on booze or something but eh, I can pretend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sitting here today in the - relatively - fresh air, with solid food in my stomach and not feeling suicidal for a change, I don't want to let anything bring me down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hey, if work won't suck more than usual I might even do the laundry when I get home.

The most interesting part is cleaning up after some kid who just so decided to throw up in the middle of the store. In the meantime though, I'm simply stacking shelves.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I zone out for the most part, only replying various grunts to anyone trying to strike up a conversation with me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's incredible how much routine one can get working a single summer. Both in terms of doing the actual job, and at handling coworkers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The first few weeks I was very, very afraid that I'll be fired for lack of social skills. Only to find that nobody cared so long as I didn't cause any trouble.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sure, this way I couldn't become part of the close-knit group of longterm employees, but that was fine with me. Going by my track record, the less people affiliate with me the better chances they'll have in life. I certainly didn't want to get caught up in another social drama.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Can't say they didn't vie for it nonetheless.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Early on they've tried to invite me to grab a beer after work or attend this or that concert with them, but after enough refusals they gave up on that. Well not entirely, but they're only asking me out of politeness now, I think.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I was also afraid that someone I know will come by and see what a loser I became. I'm not sure why, considering this place was in the middle of Skin Row, and I only knew dino folk. A limited number of 'em at that, and it wasn't likely to change anytime soon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This schoolyear was remarkably different than my first one here at Volcaldera Bluffs. Eerily so. It's only been two few weeks, but without Stella, Naser, Reed, Trish, or hell even Naomi, the hallways just felt empty. Nobody tried to talk to me, as if nobody cared.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, why would they care? To an extent, I've got my wish to be invisible, under the radar. The only one who paid me any notice was Rosa, whenever she came around to help out the gardening club.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even Fang was absent.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It worried me greatly, though during the first week it could have been chalked up to a coincidental bad-timed illness. On the second week, I went straight to Spears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He's informed me that Fang was alright, they're just in a "camp that handles rebellious teens" and they'd be back next week.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That must have fucking sucked for her. I wondered if that was the school's influence after what happened last year, or the pregorative of her parents. Either way, it was still a lot better than going to the juvie.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe I should have been locked up instead, or sent to that camp. At least it would have spiced up my summer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Alas, neither happened, and thus most of my days blended into a mundane, gray mass. One day unavoidably became like another, only differentiated by what kind of scourge fate had for me that week.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">These mostly came in the form of rude or weird customers. Although given the neighborhood, we've had hobos and junkies almost every day. A decent amount of shoplifters too, and even the occasional robberies.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Truth be told, I was very glad nobody tried to rob us while I was working the register. I'd hate to get shot for being a retard, even if ultimately that'd just be natural selection.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel kinda bad that I've regressed all progress I've made with Stella on not being a weirdo. My only excuse being that I've got other worries now. More important ones. Such as paying rent and not trying to starve at the same time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, the whole point of that would be to not be an outcast by the time I become a working adult, right? Well guess what, I AM a working adult. And I'm thankful to be a loner.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean like... Many times since Stella has left I've felt like I've allowed my life to go straight down the drain. There wasn't one single occasion for all that when I've even suspected I can change that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Being in control of this one aspect of my life - being left alone on my own accord - wasn't something I could let go of.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's not like I didn't know what I should do to feel better. Au contraire. There were maybe a hundred different things I would have to do in order to get my life back on track. Doing the laundry, eating healthy, light exercise, showering more than twice a week, actually caring for my studies, talking more with Stella and my coworkers, acquiring a real hobby, moving to a better part of town, et cetera.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Frankly it was all so... Tiresome. So much to do, so easy to fall. And I'm not sure I could ever pick myself up again after another failure. It's just so much easier to live in the safety of this bleak misery.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is it even misery? I'm merely living like any other adult, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Most days, I'd be content with my reasoning. Any excuse was good enough if it allowed me to not feel like a washout. Way too much of that going on already.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Today though... My chipper mood from morning is mostly gone, but I feel better than I normally would. Like I can make a difference.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh fuck me, fine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Here goes nothing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If anyone asks me today to go out and do something with them, I'll say yes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My vow keeps me on the edge for the rest of the day, both hoping I'll get to go through with it; and that I'll be able to go home without upsetting my quote un-quote cozy lifestyle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The usual nervous expectation versus the relief of normalcy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nothing happens till the very last minute though. I'm basically halfway out the door as that one Fang-like girl comes up to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, wait up!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's already changed back to her normal clothes. All black complete with the obligatory choker, and a bracelet made of small crosses.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her shirt sports some band's logo that I don't recognize. It also has lots of crosses. She's a few years younger than me - by looks alone - so I'm assuming it's some goth-emo-vampire-punk indie band.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Um, there's a Trinity for Hire concert this friday and I've got an extra ticket. Wanna come?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I mean, I know you're probably busy like always, but--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sure."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her face lights up with surprise. I don't blame her. Nor for the flustered response.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"C-cool! Didn't know that um, dork as you are you liked their stuff."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't tell her that I've literally never heard of them. Or that I don't even know her name.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This is just an excuse to go out and socialize, no need to make it personal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That makes sense, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She accompanies me all the way to the bus stop, going on about the band. I mostly zone out, thinking about what I just agreed to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's not a date.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At least not the way I see it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's simply two extraordinarily not romantically inclined coworkers hanging out in a totally platonic and PG-13 innocent way at a Trinity for Hire concert.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Definitely not as a date.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, even if I'd want to cheat on Stella - which is a big fucking if in itself - it definitely would not be with a coworker.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Plus she's like sixteen or something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm just trying to be normal and make some friends. Not like it had to be her specifically, only that she provided the first opportunity.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Right time, right place. That kinda deal. It could have been whatshisname or the other dude too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess I'll have to talk to her some more during the week now, or it'd be really fucking awkward. Maybe I can get away with the usual grunting.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Probably not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Regardless, my bus arrives and we part ways. But not before exchanging numbers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's not a date.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">By the time I get home I push all work related stuff from my mind, instead trying to ready myself for the schoolweek.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I sure as fuck won't be doing any homework today, but I should get into the mindset nonetheless.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The classes will probably suck and drag on endlessly as per usual, though what I'm really hoping for is getting to finally see Fang. Not really sure why.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, yeah okay, best case scenario she'll ignore me, same as everyone else.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I just want to know that she's okay, I guess. Seeing her broken again, the way she was before summer... I just... I'm not sure I could handle that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even if she beat me up again would be better. Anger fits Fang much better than depression and self-hatred.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Alright, well, that's tomorrow stuff. Let's focus on today for now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could do the laundry, for example. Or play Xrox.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Actually, maybe I should check on Stella first. There's a slim chance she's seen my message by now. Plus I probably ought to tell her about the concert.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To my great surprise, she's sent a few messages while I was asleep. Maybe I shouldn't have blown it off in the morning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I just honestly didn't expect that she'd write.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"omg im so sorry"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"mom had her friends over and i culdnt ditch"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"r u here?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The timestamp shows that she came online approximately twenty minutes after I went to bed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, fuck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's what I get for not reading up on dino shit tenaciously enough.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Although she seems to be available right now. Could she have been waiting for me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"am now"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"sup"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wait a few seconds for her to notice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It doesn't happen though, so I slump the phone into my pocket and go about preparing dinner. Not till I'm in the middle of pouring hot water over my noodles does the device buzz, signaling Stella's reply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"so tired"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"just left the office"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh right, she's working a regular 9-to-5, not like my all over the place schedule.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Man, what I'd give for a cushy office job...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"hbu? <3"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess this is the part where I tell her about the totally-not-a-date I've signed up for.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"im ok"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"going to a concert on friday"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I bite my lip, feeling a little anxious as I wait for her reply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Will she be glad that for the first time in like ever I'm going to a social event? Or will she be outraged that I'm spending time with somebody else? Especially if I tell her it's a girl?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's taking way too long. I mean, she's not even typing yet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm getting unreasonably nervous over here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe I should explain it better? Am I being an autist right now?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"its tribune for hire"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"the band"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"didnt kno u like them"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The fuck? How does everyone know a band I've literally, figuratively, and metaphorically never even heard of?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Must be a girl thing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"have fun!!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My tensed up shoulders drop, and I let out a breath I didn't even notice was holding. With the crisis averted I take my cup of noodles back to the living room and dig in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The next hour or so is spent pleasantly chatting with Stella - albeit about nothing particularly interesting. It's so refreshing to be able to talk to her that I'm starting to question if today has really happened or if I've dreamt it all up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There can't possibly be a single day where everything goes my way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Though to be honest, it would have been a rather bleak day if it wasn't for my determination to keep my chin up. In a way, I'm indirectly responsible for things turning out alright.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could have spent the morning indoors by my laptop, but I didn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could have gotten into a fight with that hobo, but I didn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could have refused whatshername, but I didn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could have wasted the entire evening playing vidya, but I didn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Feeling kinda proud about it. For real.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of course there's that nagging voice in the back of my mind, the one laughing at me proclaiming that this is but a fleeting moment compared to the next sixty years of suffering, that it won't make a difference, and that any effort I put into holding onto this feeling will only make the fall that much worse.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't outright say the voice is wrong, but still I do my best not to pay it much notice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a few seconds I consider sorting the laundry just to spite it, but I'm simply too tired to. It makes me feel a little worse, as if I'm admitting the ride is ending. Sure I feel kinda good today, but tomorrow is a whole other question.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To give myself the best chances I decide to end the day with a hot bath.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I say my goodbyes to Stella as the tub fills up, the two of us setting our next actual videochat-date-thing on thursday. She super-duper promises to show up this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Unsure what people do to relax just laying there I pass the time shitposting for a while.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a good, long while actually. I stop to laugh at the bubbles when I fart once, and to shamefully consider if I have legitimate brain damage afterwards.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The hot water eventually quells me into this somber state though, where I can't help but recall the last time I've felt this kind of engulfing warmth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That time on the beach, with Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The memory fouls my mood somewhat, especially when I follow it up with the aftermath of the party I mused myself with this morning...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm sitting on the edge of my bed, hangover.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's already past noon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's a stack of pancakes next to me. The topmost one has a crude heart shape drawn on it with cinnamon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The bedsheets feel nice and soft, opposing the sharp ache in my chest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's nobody else in the room, my only company is a note Stella has left.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Its letters are barely legible now, smudged by tears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sorry Anon but I couldn't wake you up and I have to go."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I love you, Stella"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"<3"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"PS: I've made you pancakes"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've heard of the expression "can't begin to describe how I feel", but never understood it till now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">First of all, there's the unmistakable feeling of sadness I've been wallowing in the past few days.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then there's helplessness, like a part of me is missing and there's nothing I can do anything about it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With my conscious mind I know Stella is on a plane right now, way out of my reach. I can't even contact her in any way, not for at least a couple more hours.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without having seen her board the plane though, without having that closure, I can't help but hope that this is just an elaborate joke. That she's hiding somewhere in the flat, ready to watch the next episode of whatever with me as if it was any other normal day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She isn't though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've checked.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Twice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And there's no one to blame for that but me. That might be the worst part of it all. If only I didn't drink so much last night...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait, no. There's a worse part.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I love you"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Those three words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Three words I've never heard her say, three words I've never said to her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I know she just wanted me to know but... Really, I mean...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For fuck's sake, a piece of paper? That I can't even say the words back to?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, okay, I could but that wouldn't accomplish anything. Nothing I can do would accomplish anything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Actually, there was an even worse part.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've never had the chance to give her the deck of tarot cards. All that effort, and it didn't even matter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I seriously hope that us parting like this won't make her think that I don't care.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thinking about it from Stella's perspective, it makes me wonder if she really meant her confession or if she just wanted to give me a reason to stick around.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's such a disgusting thought that I'm ashamed to even think it. But now that I have, I just can't push it from my head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A buzzing sound rudely interrupts my train of thought.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This time, though, I should actually be thankful for it. It wasn't a nice place I got to after that morning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Some would call it rock bottom, for others it would be a moronic attempt on one's own life. I didn't want to die, not really, but thinking back on it... Yeah, drunkenly provoking random people on the street in Skin Row can only have so many conclusions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another buzz, and my attention is finally fixated on the here and now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The sound is coming from my phone. I entertain the idea that it's Stella, wanting to talk some more about nothing, or even that girl from work.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As it turns out, it's neither. Only a couple of messages from my boss, going on about how we'll need to reorganize the store and repack all the shelves.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ugh, I hate doing that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've had the pleasure of just dropping into the middle of one such re-shelving at the end of my first month.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, I get it. It's a business tactic. But the only thing it really accomplishes is that for the next month and a half I'll have at least three customers every single hour asking me to help them find this or that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Plus it's a two week job at the bare minimum. Everyone fucking hates it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Whatever.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I reply with a simple "sure", and put my phone back on top of the washing machine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For the next few minutes I contemplate whether or not to stay in the now cold water, too lazy to get up. In the end I conclude that I probably should avoid catching a cold. If not for myself, but so that I can go to school and work.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With firsthand experience at what prolonged periods of missing class can do, I'm wary of missing a single one. And as for work, I need every hour I can get into that paycheque. Things are spread thin already.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a grunt I get out of the tub and dry myself, then do my usual to-bed-routine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No new messages? Check.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Alarm? Double-check.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hopes and dreams not entirely crushed? Check.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I stay up for a couple more minutes, thinking about what it'll be like to see Fang again. It's too complex an emotion to really pin it down, however hard I try.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We'll see.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wake to my alarm. Although this time I feel mostly okay, having had eight consecutive hours of sleep.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I pack my stuff for school and decide to get a hot-dog en route to class today too. It worked yesterday, so I can maybe actually really honest-to-God pull off another not-sucky day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The odds are surprisingly good, as going to school is a lot less stressful than going to work. A lot more boring too, but I swear if that's the worst it gets it's already a blessing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of course today I'll probably get to meet Fang again, and... Well I'm still not sure what to think about that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">On my way out the door I draw the top card from the cheesy anime tarot card deck, but can't interpret it as per usual.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The commute is pretty uneventful, though I'm seriously getting on edge the closer I get, to the point where I'm anxiously eyeing every corner and vehicle, trying to spot Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I keep it up all the way to the classroom. In fact I idle outside in the hallway till the bell rings and the teacher beckons me inside. No luck though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not seeing Fang pre first period shouldn't mean much on its own, but I can't help feeling uneasy about it. I can barely pay any attention to the class, fumbling with my words whenever I get called on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The very same things happen throughout the classes up till lunch period. I'm pretty confident I can spot her in the mess hall though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But of course, even with me forgoing to pick lunch to perch out in a corner where I can oversee the entire room, I see no sign of her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Never knew I could hate winged dinosaurs this much, though with every single one I spot that isn't her my contempt grows.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, it's possible she'd be at the auditorium due to old habits, I just can't see it. They only picked that spot because of Naomi, and she wasn't here anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I quickly check the time to see if I can make my way there before the bell rings, but no, probably not. Maybe tomorrow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Maybe tomorrow" really seems to be the name of the game, as Fang manages to evade me all day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I even stay behind to see if she's got detention, but no. She's just not here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, it's possible that she just got back from that camp and took the first day off, or it was some universe-level fluke of random chances to miss her all day... But...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah, this isn't helping my anxiety any.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My only consolation is that Spears claimed she's alright, and I couldn't for my life dub him a liar.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, I go home pretty much a nervous mess, imagining all sorts of colorful theories in my head. Like Fang shooting up the camp and an heroing via cop. As if such a thing could ever happen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At home I try distracting myself with actually doing housework for a change. Evening can't come soon enough.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll see Fang, for sure.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Except that I don't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not the next day, and not the day after that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel like I've seen a glimpse of her going to the girl's toilet once, but no matter how long I waited outside and called her name, she didn't show.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I probably looked like a fucking creep, pacing back and forth there, mumbling under my breath. I have no idea how I wasn't tackled by security - probably Spears looking out for me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can hardly concentrate at work too, and I'm indescribably grateful that my after-school shifts aren't that long. God bless the manager.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Having to manually remind myself every five minutes to actually focus on the task at hand isn't doing me a lot of favors. Thankfully whatshername is keeping me sort of distracted and I eventually learn a bit about her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's a bit nutty, going on about like the savior spirit and other borderline /x/ tier stuff like a religious yoga-mom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not her name though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eventually our shifts end and I find myself out on the street.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A starry night, dim city lights over my head. And I'm the only one, and I walk alone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've mostly calmed myself down over the whole Fang thing, to the point where I can at least see things clearly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It shouldn't come as a surprise that we don't share any classes, Spears probably took care of that. Or like, the entire staff did, seeing as they don't want no drama during the year. Plus it'll minimize the chances of us running into eachother.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang also could have figured my timetable out, and avoided me on purpose.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It makes me a little sad, but I know it's for the best. To be honest though, she can't dodge me for an entire year. She might be a dino, but I'm not a meteor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...Okay, I might be the metaphorical reincarnation of one. Or that of a wrecking-ball.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nevertheless, I'll catch her sooner or later.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As expected, I don't see her on thursday either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I find it oddly humorous that originally I was so preoccupied with concerns over not being able to keep the feel-good-train going by doing chores and whatnot, and yet now I can't find enough little tidbits to do to distract myself with.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The laundry is done. Bed made. Kitchen cleaned. Browser history erased.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thank God I'll get to talk with Stella today - supposedly. That should divert my attention for at least a good hour or so.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She actually shows, albeit half an hour late.

How was your week?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a second I deliberate if telling her about my Fang-anxiety is a good thing or not, concluding that I shouldn't keep secrets from my girlfriend.

To make matters worse there's a feeling building inside me, that I'm just simply fucking left out of Stella's life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, my very first concern over going to that stupid ass fucking Treaty for Hour concert was what Stella would think about it. And yet when things are reversed, she's never even thought of telling me about a drastic change like that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hell, otherwise I might have even encouraged it, a cute tomboy gf haircut is very much not on my list of things to avoid.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As it is, though, the only thing it manages to do is make me nitpick all the otherwise mundane little shits I can use to fuel my rage over this. Going back all the way to her faggotry "confession of love" on the letter she left me that morning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've always felt ashamed to have thought she didn't mean it, yet it seems to make sense now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah right, "couldn't wake me". As if she ever wanted to. I damn bet she shared a seat with some faggot too.

I mean, yeah, it's her hair, but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Apparently what I think about it wasn't a concern for her for one second.

But I can't even do that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I spend the rest of the evening variably staring at the four walls, sitting down to play Xrox or to shitpost every now and again but not finding the strength in myself to do either of those things.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The oh-so-familiar feeling that nothing in life really matters anymore claws up my spine, eliciting deafening laughter from the voice in my head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A fleeting second compared to the next sixty years of suffering, was it? Doesn't even seem like an exaggregation now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I sit in my chair for a long time. Legs splayed, hands danging down on either side of me, staring up at the ceiling but not looking at anything in particular. For all intents and purposes, the physical space taken up by my body could very well be an unshaped blob.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's how I feel at least. Useless, unwanted. Someone that doesn't matter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang wants nothing from me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella pities me with a conversation every now and then, but she doesn't care it seems.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nobody in school talks to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My own parents have practically disowned me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I never could have imagined I'd say this, but suddenly I appreciate my coworkers' idle attempts to invite me to social events.

I really hope it's not true.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">God, it cannot be true.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've never considered myself a religious person, but for time first time in my life I'm actually praying to some higher force. Not to make things right, not to lift these weights off me or to give me broader shoulders.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Only to give me a sign that I matter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's all I need.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wake to my alarm again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Snooze.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Snooze again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Twice, thrice more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It pretty much takes me a little over half an hour to get out of bed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No breakfast.

To what end, I have no idea. But I feel like this is the last connection I have to the Stella who loved me for real, the one I could lock in my arms, the one for whom I forfeited my life so long ago.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What's the point? I couldn't make sense of it, not that it told the future by any margin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And it certainly has no bearing over Stella's feelings towards me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe it's that if I keep grasping, if I don't let go, then things can still turn for the better, right? There's still a chance, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah right, grasping at straws that is.

Now she's really gone. Maybe there's a vaguely Stella-like person out there in the world who plays at being my girlfriend, but it's not nearly the same. We're not equals, and we're hardly in a relationship.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I search my hazy memories while prodding idly at my lunch, trying to pinpoint the first sign of Stella losing interest in me.

Surely, I can understand that she probably met up with her family and didn't want to mess around with her phone and stuff. But like... Just a simple message or a quick picture was all it would have taken.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But, okay, I can chalk this up to her just being a dork, rather than actual malice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I scroll to our next convo, though before I could get to it the phone buzzes in my hand, notifying me about a message from a number I don't recognize.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[????]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"hey anon, pick me up at around 4, k? heres my address"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Followed by - obviously - an address.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I realize it's the girl from work, talking about our da-- Our casual hangout.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"mom wants to see u too so act like ur my supervisor plz"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Uh, okay?

It's not that I don't trust him - well I don't, but I'm not actively suspicious of him either -, I just don't feel like talking to anyone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't feel like doing anything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Really, I pretty much don't feel anything at all, except a slight bit of nervousness the closer we get to our destination. I still am meeting with a girl, afterall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A coworker at that, so if I let my 'tism take over and embarrass myself, I'm sure everyone at work will know. I don't need another Rock Bottom incident.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In any case, we arrive and I pay the guy. Again, to be safe I wait till the cab rolls away and turns the corner. I don't quite believe they are organ traffickers, but I don't want to give them B'n'E tips either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a sigh I start walking to the actual address, fishing my phone from my pocket to let the girl know I'll get there soon. Her chirpy response almost makes me smile as well.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Almost.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Their home seems nice enough. It's still a multi-story rowhouse, although it's a lot more posh looking than the commie blocks over at my place. I bet they even have heating too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's waiting for me outside, accompanied by an older woman who I assume to be her mother.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Weird. I expected her to like, I don't know, invite me in for a snack or something? I mean, that's how people meet their date's parents, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not that, of course, she is my date. So it's all good, honestly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's not wearing her usual goth makeup either, dressed mostly in white and other light pastel colors, pretty much a carbon copy of her mother's getup.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's kinda odd, but maybe she's just putting on a show till we get to the concert. Me acting like her supervisor is probably part of the smokes and mirrors dance for her mom.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I get closer I wave at them to get their attention.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She turns to me with a smile that once again gets very close to melting the icicle that is my heart right now, but it doesn't quite make it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey there!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a second there I worry that she'll actually take my hand as if I was her boyfriend or something. Thankfully she steps aside like a proper little lady, introducing me to her mother.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mom, this is Anon, my supervisor from work. He's super dependable and polite."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I do my best to suppress my retarded laughter after such an intro, and try to actually play along. I extend my hand for a handshake, straightening my back as if I had a spine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Pleased to meet you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl's Mom]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, it's very nice to meet you also."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We exchange a handshake that is neither too firm nor too sloppy, however I'm not really sure what to do or say after that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The girl picks up on the signs of my awkwardness showing, and decides to take matters into her own hands.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay, so now you know he's not like a serial killer or anything, can we go?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The elder lady takes her time to look me over once again, giving her blessing in the end.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl's Mom]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Of course dearie. Have lots of fun, but be back--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Be back by eight, I know. I will."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">By eight? What kind of concert is that?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even with my very limited knowledge of social events I know that the fun usually starts after sundown, and not before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nevertheless, I watch the lady give her daughter a loving smooch on her forehead, ruffling her hair up a bit, then leave us to go on our way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm looking for a way to make a snide comment about it, though I'm shot down before I could really come up with anything good.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't even go there. Just call a cab, will you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh, sure."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I dial the same shady company as we turn a corner.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Soon as we're out of view from their building I expect the girl to pull out a dark lipstick or something, yet she doesn't. She seems totally cool with her generic good girl outfit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm so confused by it that I don't even know where to begin. Like, is her goth side the con then? I mean okay she wears that bracelet with the crosses, but I didn't expect her to actually be religious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We wait on the curb in awkward silence till our carriage arrives. It's the same guy who brought me here, and I'm sure he recognizes me too. Thankfully he makes no comment about it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He doesn't try to strike up a conversation this time either, so the stiff atmosphere doesn't quite go away. We're all just kinda staring out of the windows, watching the buildings flash us by.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At one point the girl hands me my ticket, and I'm sure to notice her fingers slightly brushing up against mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The long-forgotten feeling of excitement mixed with uncontrollable spaghetti flows reignites within me, and I actually start sweating a little. Whereas I was content with the ill-at-ease ambiance between us, now I'm afraid to be this much of a dweeb.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Suddenly, I don't want to botch the date. So much so that I finally admit it for what it really is, a fucking date.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a real human girl.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, sweet mother Mary of Raptor Jesus.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuck do I? What do I say?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So um, nice dress."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah okay, thanks."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That uh, that went well, right? It was a good compliment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I check the cab guy's reaction in the rearview mirror.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He's just subtly shaking his head at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I keep my mouth shut for the remainder of the ride.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After what feels like an eternity we arrive at the festivities' site.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">White pallet fences and flags, crosses everywhere, middle-aged folks - composite of humans and dinos alike - stumbling about the limited number of teens and small children, vendors selling non-junk food like corn on the cob...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At once, everything makes sense.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's a fucking Christian "rock" band. Trinity for Hire.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trinity, as in, like, the holy spirit and stuff.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh my fucking God, just kill me now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait, did this count as actual blasphemy? Does this actually make a holy site?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...Yeah, probably not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I check on the girl, unable to fathom why she'd want to ever come here on her own. And yet she seems genuinely excited.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I really do fucking hope at least the music's gonna be good.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once again I pay the cab guy - with a hefty tip - and watch him roll away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a forced and hopefully not creepy smile I turn to the girl, motioning towards the entrance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So, uh... S-shall we?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She fumbles around a little, for the first time looking a little embarrassed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uhm, yeah uh, the thing is..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Go grab a beer or something Anon, I'll be okay on my own."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I furrow my brows, unsure what she means.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Like, grab one for you too? Or like...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She gives a deep sigh, as if having to explain some clear-as-day idea to a retard.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, she might actually be doing just that cause I can be a dense motherfucker, but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No, I mean, I don't need you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The idiotic grin vanishes from my face, heart skipping a beat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I don't need you"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">N-no... She's just joking, yeah?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This is not right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"B-but--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Look, I'm sorry that I played you like this but Mom didn't let me come alone."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I've only asked you cause everyone else already said no."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I-- Okay but--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"B-but, this is a date?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She gives me such a pitiful disgusted look that it takes me considerable effort not to collapse. Like a fourth-grader when his crush rejects them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, I'd never date a coworker."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Plus you don't even care about me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"T-that's not true!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh yeah?

At least there was one girl, one fucking person on the entire planet who wanted to be with me. Someone that actually, against all odds, found me desirable. Or at the very least more than a literal waste of oxygen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But no. Fucking not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Crumpled-up ticket in my hand, surrounded by possibly the most benign, oblivious and happy people for a hundred miles, something within me breaks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why the fuck do THEY deserve happiness?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuck do THEY have that I don't?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What are THEY doing that I just can't?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">FUCK</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've spent THE ENTIRE WEEK fixing things.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I did EVERYTHING RIGHT.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">IT'S NOT ME THAT ABANDONED MYSELF</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The world starts spinning around me in circles, colors merging into a cacophonic cyclone, darkness closing in. I vaguely realize that I'm hyperventilating, but it feels like it's not actually happening to me, as if I was just an observer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A crowd gathers, people trying to talk to me. Probably asking if I'm alright, but I barely register their words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Someone - likely security - comes up to me, ushering me to a table.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I let them sit me down but no more, chasing them away with various colorful strings of curses that make a few parents cover their children's ears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Serves them fucking right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The security guy threatens me, and finally I do shut up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They stay close by for the next few minutes, though the crowd eventually dissipates. Afterall, I'm literally just sitting there in silence, breathing in and out like a madman.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">An incomprehensible amount of time later I regain control of my body again, senses slowly returning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm still sitting by that same table, except nobody around me pays any notice. It's dark out now, way past the eight o'clock mark when I was supposed to take that bitch home.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not that I care in the slightest. Her perfect mother can ground her in their perfect home.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or maybe she's out with some guy, making Jesus proud.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's all the same to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Looking around, the ratio of old-to-young attendees has changed markedly. There are mostly teens and tweens around, with the exception of a few families sticking together.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I finally notice the music too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's some brand of whiny-rock, going on about having faith and whatnot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah, that's just what I need.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This-- It's just--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel so fucking alone and miserable right now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Really, was it too much to ask for, not to be invisible?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is there anything I can do now to get back on track? To have a decent life?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's as if no matter what I do, something out of my control always comes along to push me down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">One step forward, two roundhouse kicks in the gut.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Damn I wish I had a cigarette right now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I haven't even smoked since I've gotten together with Stella...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To distract myself I turn my attention to the masses again, scanning each one of them in great detail. Both longing to belong; and trying to figure out where I've gone wrong and they haven't. Among all these average Joe and Jane looking folks, statistics alone would dictate that at least ONE is a depressed fuck like me. Or in the very least show signs of going through hardships.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After several minutes I notice a familiar bundle of colors. I squint my eyes, trying to see over the crowd - almost climbing up on the table too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It-- It can't be who I think it is.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The crowd thins for a second and undoubtedly, I see her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's wearing a pastel-colored dress like so many girls around her, but there's no mistaking that it's her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Accompanied by her parents, she's cheering to the music without a care in the world, a wide smile on her face. From what I can tell, she's pretty straightened out as well. No trackmarks on her arms, wings neatly manicured. And that smile, that genuine and happy smile...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm so relieved to see her like this. Way, way more than just floating around - or actively getting worse - as I had feared.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At the same time though, it makes me incredibly sad. All it took to make her truly happy was to cut contact with me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The song playing comes to an end, and Fang applauds with the rest of the crowd.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her father jokingly elbows her in the side and says something, causing her to turn her head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hastily duck when I see her turning my way, panicking as I feel like we've made eye contact for a brief moment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Unable to wait for more than a bat of an eye I raise my head again, and I can see Fang looking right at me. Her expression is one of total disbelief.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We stare at one another for a few seconds till the next song starts. That's when her parents notice her frozen on the spot, and turn to see what she's looking at.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her mother is short enough not to see me, but the look on her father's face says it all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He gathers the two female dinos up, and ushers them towards the entrance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without really thinking about it, I move to intercept them. I honest to God have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I keep losing sight of them in the crowd, but luckily I'm way closer to the gates than they are.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Soon, we find eachother face to face. The difference between the two sides is so monumental that it almost makes me laugh. Me, the sad debris of a human, alone and beaten by the world; against the close knit Arin family, nigh the image of a perfect suburban dino family.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's stifling silence, the air loaded with emotions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Scattered images of our standoff with Fang flash before my eyes. The two of us standing out there in the rain by the school garden, getting drenched to the bone as I tell her I don't love her anymore. Fang's fist closing in as she decks me in the face in response, followed by several more punches and kicks. Then, my vision fading, and falling to the ground midst the torn up pieces of Stella's old tarot cards...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Shaking the memory I return to the present, opening my mouth to greet the Arins.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang's father interrupts me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Ripley]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What do you think you're doing here? Leave us alone you little brat!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I-- I'd just like to talk to Fang."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can see her fidget as I say her name. Or maybe just generally in response to hearing my voice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At the same time her father shoots me a cold, killer glare that would probably make even the most hardened criminals cower in fear. The way things are though, it doesn't really have an effect on me. I simply don't care enough to get intimidated. At least my struggles would be over if he breaks my neck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We continue this mute back and forth staring contest till Fang opens her mouth to speak. Only to be interrupted by her mother this time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She pushes Fang back towards her father, stepping between us protectively.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Samantha]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, just go away please! Lucy is doing fine without you. Please don't bring the past up again!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She says my name with such contempt I didn't even know she's capable of. I understand where it's coming from, of course.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a good look at her and his husband again, both staring at me with disdain, clearly expecting me to leave.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang - or is it Lucy now? - is looking down at the ground, biting her lower lip. She doesn't look sad or angry though. More like she's embarrassed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I assume it's for her parents' behavior, that they're acting like she's a four-year-old or something, who can't decide what's best for her. She probably wants to say something but doesn't dare to, not wanting to risk the progress she's made.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And honestly? I don't blame her. If someone could magically fix my relationship with Stella and all I had to do was to keep my god damned mouth shut, I'd go with that too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's just... I'm kinda shaken to see Fang like this. Other than her physical appearance - excluding the generic tradwife outfit - there's nothing here that says "Fang" anymore. She's like a mere husk of her former self.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her parents are still glaring daggers at me, but now I can see that it isn't as much as they're mad at me, they just don't want to upset Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a second there a spark ignites in my chest, that I should fight them to bring the real Fang back, that it's not okay to lobotomize her like this. Yet it's so short lived that I can't be sure if I imagined it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They're right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's nothing to be gained here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sorry to have bothered you. I'll go now..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Their relief is notable, and I turn away without further ado.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't look back at them either, not until Fang's voice hits my ears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...mom, I can handle..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's only one fragment of a single sentence, but one that makes me curious enough to stop and turn back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's taken a few steps in my direction, and was stopped by her mother it seems. She's clutching Fang's arms with both hands in an attempt to pull her back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can see her beak moving, but I can't make out a lot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Samantha]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...not make a scene dear..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Samantha]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...go home where it's..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My stomach turns in sheer disgust, seeing Fang handled like this. They really are acting like she's just a child.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It might not even be about Fang so much as their own reputation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like training a dog not to shit on the carpet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look at her father again, and he's looking right back at me, urging me to leave them the fuck alone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Much to my own surprise my first thought is "fuck you old man", and one more time I feel like I should do something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But... I know I shouldn't. All I've ever managed to do was fuck up my own life, and the lives of anyone that ever associated themselves with me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang - Lucy - may be in a bad spot now, but who's to say she won't be better in a year? Do I really want to fuck with her future? Again?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her progress might be slow, but it's progress. I mean, she hasn't fought anyone in the crowd, didn't give me a concussion, she can apparently go to a show with her parents to have fun... These are all things her old self couldn't have done.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once again, I'm probably just a dipshit who can't let go of the past.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm just about to turn my back on them for good when another cry from Fang rings out. It's noticeably louder this time, making multiple heads turn their way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mom please, let me do this!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't hide the cringe from my face, seeing a grown-ass woman ask her mother for permission do to something. Looking at her father anew, it's clear he's embarrassed about it too. His stare saying "please just leave already" rather than "stay and I'll disembowel you".</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Likely pressured by the multitudes of whispers spreading around them, Fang is finally let off the hook - though hesitantly so. Immediately she turns to me, as if she was afraid her mother will go back on her word.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's still a bit of distance between us, which she closes with quick strides. At least till the last two meters or so, where she loses her grit and abruptly stops.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't step up to her. I both feel like it's her struggle to fight through; and that I'd have to respect her decision were she to change her mind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can see her slowly, painfully slowly starting to turn back towards her parents, only to shake her head before she could actually look at them. It's quite clear that they keep her on a short leash, and there's great uncertainty in her current situation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Plus it's about me. Probably the last person in the world she'd want to see or talk to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There still are some bystanders staring her down too. Like that's not a stress factor, surely.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She takes one last deep breath, and finally faces me for real. Without coming any closer she barks her words at me, crossing her arms over her chest protectively.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why are you here, A-an-n? What do you want?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The way she struggles to say my name hits me surprisingly hard. As if it was some curse word, and a particularly bad one at that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">While waiting for my response, Fang inspects me head to toe. There's clearly something in her eyes, some shine that I can't quite interpret. Is she concerned? About me? About herself? About her parents maybe? Or does she pity me? Curious as to why I look like a meth addict?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't even know how I'd explain that to her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh it's no biggie, I'm just in a self-destructive downward spiral where I barely eat, lack basic hygiene, refuse to talk to anyone, and routinely stay up all night to read a book on relationships despite successfully tanking my current one. All without even knowing what I did wrong, and that's only because Stella couldn't stay with me having failed half my classes - which I can thank YOU for, by the way, after you've beaten me up so severely that I almost got into a fucking coma. But hey! At least today I got a free ticket to a concert I otherwise would have avoided by a couple hundred miles minimum. And I only had to pay a might-be-criminal cab driver twice, so maybe I can even pay rent this month if I continue not eating."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That just sums it all up, doesn't it? Where the fuck did things go this fucking batshit off the rails?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The more I think about it though, my sarcastic remark starts making more and more sense. After it's all said and done, isn't it Fang who I should blame? If it wasn't for her, I could have graduated along with Stella and the rest of the class. We could have rented our own apartment somewhere, and we could have had a nice summer together. I probably would even have followed up on my intentions to propose to her by now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean yeah, Fang didn't beat me just for fun, I did cheat on her. But that book was already closed till SHE chose to open it up again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I realize that it's way past time I replied something to Fang's question as to why I wanted to see her now. Well, I still don't know why I did it, but luckily I have one very fucking swell idea what to do with the opportunity.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Last time I might have held myself back from hurting her, but oh no not anymore. I will so enjoy painting that immaculate dress red with her blood. Then her father can shoot me, and it'll finally all be over. At least I'll go out doing something that makes ME feel better, instead of servicing someone else.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck my parents.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck work and fuck whatshername.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And most of all, fuck Fang for taking my future away!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a step forward, reaching towards her with one hand. I want to grab her, choke her, shove her to the ground and bash her head in with a rock and--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Raptor Jesus on the fucking stick!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She really did take my life away, didn't she? And then SHE gets to be happy? A good little christian girl pampered by her parents? Where's the justice?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh that's right, there's none. There's only the vengeance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another step. Fang doesn't waver.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It baffles me on some deep level. Sure, maybe my apathetic sullen face doesn't reflect my intentions, but I'm literally about to grab her. Do I mean nothing to her THIS MUCH? I'm not even a threat?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Only as I take the last step to close the distance between us does she back up, yet for some unfathomable reason she looks sorry instead of afraid.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, don't try it. I won't hug you back."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her words shock me to the core just the same as whatshername's have, if not more so. Hug her?! I want to fucking murder her!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I freeze in motion and nearly trip over my own feet, retracting my hand to keep my balance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wh--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">How could she EVER think that I still want to be with her? Is this some elaborate fantasy she gets off to? Does she cry herself to sleep over what could have been every night or something?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean just what the fuck?!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As I try to gather my bearings and make ANY sense of the situation, Fang literally turns her back on me with one last sorrowful sigh, making her way back to her parents.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">BITCH WHAT THE FUCK</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">COME BACK HERE I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'M--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Was I seriously just about to...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Beat Fang up?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Christ, what the fuck is wrong with me? Am I really this fucked in the head?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I fall to my knees, looking down at my own hands. The very ones I, just moments ago, intended to take Fangs's life with - and I no longer recognize them as belonging to me. Who's this stranger that would turn to murder just to make himself feel better?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Suddenly, I'm afraid of both myself, and of the realization that I don't even know who am I anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All my life, I've just been that weirdo with his video games. And I was fine with that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then I became the weirdo with the weirdo gf - two of them, even - though I didn't even notice the change. And I was still fine, mostly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But, now-- No. For the last three months, I was--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've been--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fang!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The word slips from my mouth before I even realize it. She doesn't hear it at first, not over the sounds of the crowd, having already halved the distance to her parents, to safety.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Please, someone tell me what's happening to me...!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Fang!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This time I shout with all my remaining strength, successfully getting her attention.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Who am I?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her surprise at the question is clearly visible, and it takes her a while to process it. Me being on my knees probably doesn't help the situation either. But I need to know.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her snout opens and closes multiple times, yet there are no words.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In this exact moment a floodlight from the show flashes over us, settling over Fang for just a second or two. However short the spectacle filling my vision is, it stupefies me all the same.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With her entire frame illuminated by white brilliance, in the clear gown and surrounded by her feathery wings, Fang looks nothing short of an actual angel. As if she was one with the light itself, chosen by the heavens to translate their will. Their judgment of one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This is it. This is the sign I prayed for!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Time itself slows down around us as I kneel in the mud before Fang, honest-to-god believing that I'm witnessing an actual miracle. That somehow Fang became a conduit of a higher force that'll fix everything. Live or die, or if I'm put into a cheesy time-rewind situation, or be bestowed with ultimate wisdom... Finally, FINALLY, someone will tell me what to do. Someone will help me fix things.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The second passes though, and the very earthly squalor of two broken souls is all that's left in its wake.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's no ultimate wisdom. There's no help.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's only a confused Fang who already half-turned her back on me. Her breaths are short, shrunken pupils darting all around but unable to focus on anything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon, you're--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"To me, you're--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No matter how hard she tries, that's all she can produce. In the end, Fang shoots me one last glare that I can't even tell what it's trying to convey, then she tears her eyes from mine's, running back to her kin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The crowd between us closes in a matter of seconds, and once again I'm left behind, on my knees in the dark.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Some sign that was.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's not till way later that I see the events transpired in a different manner.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm back home, sitting on the ground in front of my electric heater, knees pulled up between my arms. Were anyone to enter the darkened room now, I'd look like a teenage girl who just got dumped. Minus the ice cream.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Except I was dumped by... Life? I guess.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, maybe not entirely. A crazy theory slowly takes shape inside my head. It's so improbable that I'm ninety-percent sure I'm making it up as a coping mechanism so I can feel better.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Perhaps it really was a sign? THE sign, that I still matter?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, okay. Fang made it very clear that she wants to keep her distance. But maybe, just maybe, could that be because she still loves me? And she's afraid to go down that road again?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, back there I must have looked like a hobo or zombie reaching my arm towards her. Yet her first reaction was that I was going for a hug?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If I hate someone with all my being, if he's the sole reason why I had to change my entire personality, then I don't fucking think about stuff like hugging that person. And I definitely don't assume he'd try to be nice to me either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Furthermore, she tried to say something about what I mean to her. Maybe she couldn't bring herself to say anything cause she was afraid I'd rebuff her again? Could it really be true that she's still holding onto the fantasy of the two of us being together?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hell, she didn't even need to come talk to me anyway. I was already going away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What was it she said to her mother? What was it she had to handle? Her feelings towards me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not those of hate, but those of a suppressed hope that could ignite the same fire inside her that I've felt too? That she's not the real Fang anymore? That she's living a lie?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A stranger to herself, just as I am to me now? A hollow husk, a twisted shadow of the big dreams of a teenager?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After all this time, after all we've gone through, could she really think that I'm the one to fix her? And that she would fix me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is this our destiny?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I stare at the red-hot metal pipe of the heater, as if trying to find someone who agrees with me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of course, my silent companion suffers my struggle unmoved, emotionless.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Next, I bring one of my hands eye-level. Ever since I got home I've been clutching onto my phone, unable to work up the courage to message Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm not even sure what would be worse. If I send her some wall of text, dumping all my feelings and insecurities there and she won't react to it; or if she replied some inane stuff about anime and totally disregarded my misery. At least if the former had happened I could pretend she just doesn't have the time, but would care otherwise.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The thing is, I see equal chances for either happening.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Should I just go ahead and break up with her then? Take a chance with Fang again? Even if Fang would reject me, that'd be fair, unlike Stella refusing to even acknowledge that there might be a problem with our relationship.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Plus, I don't KNOW if Fang would say no. Not yet. With Stella though, I'm fairly certain she doesn't care for me anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's really the worst part of it all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No matter how long I sit by the heater, I come to no conclusion. Despite a great many sources of pain in my life pointing at Stella as the source, I can't bring myself to admitting defeat. It's as if she's the only piece of my life that connects me to happier times. That without her, I'd let it all go and allow this new stranger Anon to take over, and I'd simply be gone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And I still do love her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't want to push her away because fixing this mess is the only chance I have at bringing my weirdo anime-loving tarot-reader astrologer-wannabe girlfriend back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yet the prospect of giving it all up is so inviting. Especially now that I see a real opportunity of patching up old wounds with Fang also.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The sounds of heavy raindrops catch my attention, and with a grunt I make my way to the window. It's dark out, deep into the moonless night. I doubt that I'll get any sleep in before the morning comes in any case.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Staring at the halo of the flickering lampposts, watching the rain, I can almost convince myself that tomorrow things will go back to normal. Bleak as they ever were. That this ache in my chest will fade, that I'll stop thinking about Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After all, me trying to prove that she still has feelings towards me is probably just wishful thinking. It's only me, trying to find any footing in the dark. It's simply the first thing that came along to give me false hope, and I shouldn't think about it any harder than that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...Right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I perch out by the windowsill, ogling the rain till the first rays of sunshine light up the night.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With them comes a buzz from my phone that I first assume to be my alarm. On closer inspection though, it's a message.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">More buzzes, more messages.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, it's probably Stella having her lunch break or something. I'm pleasantly surprised that she felt like texting me, though at the same time I'm a little afraid to see what it's about. I'm worried that she'll offhandedly reveal more information about her escapades with a guy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Totally platonic escapades I mean.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Turns out my worries are completely irrelevant however, as the messages aren't even from Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">They're from Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can practically feel my heart skipping a couple of beats, and I go weak at the knees. Thankfully I was already standing by the bed and I can swiftly sit down, otherwise I most likely would have collapsed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm so flabbergasted that without thinking, I tap the notification.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"hey Anon"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"id like to come over today"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"if its ok with u"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"i wanna talk about some stuff"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"this mess wer in"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"u n i"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"we cn stlil make it rgiht :V"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My brain has practically flatlined. I have no idea how to respond.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is this even real?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I have this elaborate fantasy of Fang looking out of her window, just the same as I was, having spent the entire night awake and trying to figure out how to phrase these messages. No, better yet, if she should even send them.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But, more to the point, could it be that I was actually right? There it is, plain as day and misspelled, she thinks we can "stlil make it rgiht". With an emoji.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's like--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Okay, yeah, let's not get ahead of myself. All she says is that she wants to talk and clean up some mess. It could very well be that she wants to once and for all make it clear: I have no place in her life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, that wouldn't really make anything right, nevertheless it might just allow us both to move on. Afterall I thought I already have, but evidently it was enough to see Fang once to get to the point where I'm considering breaking up with Stella. I can hardly fathom how it must have been for Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">These all feel like weak excuses that shrink in comparison to the obvious a-bomb of Fang wanting to give us another chance. Maybe seeing me alone at a concert gave her the idea that I'm not with Stella anymore? Or maybe she just wants to be friends.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Taking a deep breath, I bring the phone screen into view. Oh god, how do I talk to girls again, without being a sperg about it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"yeah okay"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"id like that"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's not a weird thing to say, right? I don't think I went too far at least. Just making it clear that she doesn't have to worry about coming over.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thank fuck I have no work today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"2pm?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"thats ok"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"okay"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Christ, this is going too smoothly. I don't even have to tidy up, having spent all week cleaning up to distract myself from the mental anguish of not seeing Fang at school.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Obviously, this can mean only one thing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">IT'S GONNA BE A FUCKING CATASTROPHE</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After having spent the following hour or so anxiously pacing back and forth in the room, I finally manage to calm myself enough to rationally consider the situation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A girl is coming over. Regardless of the context of the visit, I should prepare for it adequately.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like as if I was a normal person?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Okay, so the first step would be to clean shop, although that's like ninety-nine percent done. All I have to do is make the bed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Right, then I should probably get some snacks, I guess? Like uh, smores or something? I have no idea what this new Fang - or Lucy - likes. In fact, should I be addressing her as Lucy now? This is so confusing.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At least going to the store is something normal. That should calm me a little, I hope.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I put on my boots and shit, grab an umbrella, only stopping to pick a tarot card again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, I still have no idea what it means, but I at least recognize this one. Death.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I have some faint memories of Stella telling me it doesn't actually symbolize death as in like, dying, more the end of something. Maybe even the beginning of something new, when combined with yadda-yadda arcana-this-and-that I didn't pay attention cause she was showing cleavage.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Guess I'm paying the price for that now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nonetheless, the memory puts me in quite a somber mood as I descend the stairs. Makes me wonder what Stella could be doing right now, and what her day-to-day life actually is like.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I know she has a job, and I've sort of deduced that her mother likes to parade her around to people. But what are her bad days like? Does she even have bad days? It can't be all around paradise over there, that's just not humanely possible.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Does she ever tire of it all? Does she have any doubts? Like, is her ignorance of our problems her way of shielding herself from the truth? The truth, that we're not really a couple anymore? Would that mean that somewhere deep down she actually cares?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I know that trying to rationalize her behavior is just me wishing things turned out some other way. But it also reminds me of something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Principal Spears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">More specifically, his warning that I shouldn't bandwagon one side or the other like a fucking ping-pong ball. Exactly the way I am doing now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">One nice thought about Fang, and I'm ready to break up with Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">One pleasant memory with Stella on the other hand, and I suddenly wish we were still together.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even the thought of picking a side sounds terrible, as if it was a political party or something. I should be able to listen to my heart, simple as that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Some serious soul-searching will be due once this thing with Fang is over. Assuming I won't do something stupid.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Arriving at my destination pulls me back to the physical world. It's a simple convenience store, the closest one to the flat. I usually come here to buy my TV dinners and whatnot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a second I entertain the idea that I should get a pack of condoms also, but I cast it aside quickly. The fewer chances I allow myself to screw things up the better.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Entering the store I quickly note that the heating is turned way the fuck up, contrasting the harsh cold rain outside. I swear I saw a snowflake or two in there as well, a clear sign that the real colds are coming soon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's not many people around this early, so I make quick work of picking my stuff. Potato chips, popcorn, lemonade powder. That ought to do it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">While I'm at it I grab some frozen lasagna too, I'll need something for dinner anyway. It's also coincidentally a dinner-for-two pack, surely nothing to do with Fang coming over. I mean, I can't seriously hope that she'll spend the night, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait, would it be weird if I put two towels out in the bathroom? Or would she expect that?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I forcibly clear my head of these misguided ideas, stepping up to the counter. The cashier girl - who is surprisingly a dino - scans my stuff nonchalantly, she only comments at the lasagna that it's her favorite also. Her red scales and fluffy tail really remind me of someone, but I can't quite put my finger on it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She tries to put up some smalltalk as I pay, and for once I don't dodge the social interaction. I can do with some distraction to kill time, plus also I feel a weird connection with a fellow store-worker. Like a brotherhood. I know very well how these morning shifts are, dragging on endlessly and making one question their own mortality.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not that we have much to talk about. She asks if I'm from the area, cause she's new here - no wonder I haven't met her yet - and would like to know where the "good spots" are. What kind of good spots, I have no idea, so I tell her as much.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This displeases her, commenting that I shouldn't be such a square and live my life having fun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah, advice from some junkie is the last thing I need. It amuses me though, as if all my problems would be solved if I started drinking or something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I thank her for her wisdom with the least amount of sarcasm I can produce, and take my leave. Exiting the store I once again notice how fucking hot it was in there, shivering a little as I open my umbrella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I also notice, however, that my breaths make little clouds in the air, and I take a second or two playing pretend-dragon. To hell with all my life problems, I can at least cherish these little moments. Especially considering how few and far between they are.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe that girl had a point.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Alright, fine. I will do something fun once I get home. Something silly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Huh, I guess I could play pretend some more, acting like I was an e-celeb streamer. Shameful as it was, some years back I often did that. Just sitting by myself in my room, talking to the screen as if I had an audience.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was uh... It was pretty pathetic. But I enjoyed it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe I'll enjoy it again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I get so caught up in my little role-playing, that I almost miss the buzz of the doorbell.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Promptly shutting up mid-sentence I hastily turn the console off and move to the door, opening the multitude of locks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Certainly, my face is a bright crimson, having been caught acting so childishly. At the same time my heartrate is picking up fast, as I'm very sure that on the other side of the door is Fang herself. Or, like, Lucy. I guess.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a second to consider if I should maybe act like I'm not home, even though she's clearly heard my voice and me unlocking the door.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">One last look at the television to make sure the game is off, and with a deep breath I steel myself for what's to come, opening up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Out there, of course, is Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This time she's actually more Fang-like too, not Lucy-like. The tradwife dress is gone, replaced with a mundane hoodie and jeans. She's not carrying an umbrella though, so the rain must have let up since I got home. On her side instead is her old bag from last semester, but it looks kinda weird on her now. As if it was out of place without the punk-goth getup.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She seems just as anxious as I feel.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"H-hey!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...Hi..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Were you just um, on the phone or...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The red tint on my face deepens, and I blurt out the first thing I can use to ameliorate the awkward situation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah, no, I um, it wasn't the phone."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh-huh..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Situation ameliorated.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The conversation seems to run out there, and it takes me more time than I'd like to admit to figure out she's probably waiting for me to invite her in.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh um, c-come on in! Haha!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I step aside, allowing Fang to enter, closing the door behind her as she takes a look around.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"This place is pretty much the same, huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well, it's a lot cleaner I guess..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Er, yeah, I try to keep it together, haha!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Christ, I need to calm the fuck down. I'm acting like some pleb who's never been around a girl before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"There's uh, some snacks on the desk and uhhhh, I can make some lemonade?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang inspects said snacks for a few seconds with a conflicted expression, in the end opting to instead sit down on the bed. She sets the bag down by her feet, still clutching the strap. I guess she's really nervous too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Um, sure, okay."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"O-okay, be right back."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After a quick round-trip to the kitchen, I return with two glasses of lemonade that I hope I didn't sugar too much with these shaky fucking hands. Funnily enough, I can't help but think about all the "Glass her" memes, and in spite of the gravity of the situation I nearly fail to suppress my laughter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I find Fang standing by my desk, with an envelope in her hand. I'm not really sure what it's about till she exchanges it for her glass.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Please read this!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I didn't think I could say the things I want, like, say them right, so um, I wrote them down instead."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's shame in her voice, but I find the idea neat. Seems like she has this all figured out. So much so that she's already pulling my chair out for me, implying that I'll want to sit down for this one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah, okay.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I oblige, and Fang returns to her bag behind me. To give me some space, I guess?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For the next few seconds I can hear her shuffling about, probably too nervous to just sit around. I can hardly keep my composure as well - especially as I open the envelope, revealing the letter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It gives me some minor flashbacks of the letter Stella left for me that faithful morning, but I soldier on. I'm too hip to be square.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I hope I was brave enough to give you this letter. It's a bad thing I'm about to do, and I need to you read this."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Back when you told me that you can't ever love me, I think a part of me died. It just took too long for me to figure that out."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But I also figured out that I have to stop being a damn burden for everyone. It's no wonder people hate me, cause there's not a single good thing about me."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I don't think I ever really knew who or what I wanted to be, I was just running away from everyone's expectations. I didn't want to be the perfect daughter, because the truth is that I didn't deserve to be."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"When we were together, I thought I've got a second chance to figure myself out. Cause you know if someone cares for me, that means I'm still worth the hassle, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But then Stella came along, and it all changed. I don't blame her, not that much at least. And I don't blame you. It was my stupidity alone that I thought I could put my faith in anyone else but myself. From now on I'll build my future alone, by any means necessary."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And that means this is the end now."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm very sorry."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">By the end I can barely keep my tears at bay. It hurts so fucking much to read this.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've never considered that Fang could be just as broken as me, if not more so. Not back then. When we started dating I thought her life was pretty straightened out, with the glaring exception of that whole enbie business.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I really honestly thought that I was the fucked up loser, not her. Going by past experience alone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm not sure what the end of the letter is about though, but I think we can figure it out together. I'm a little saddened that this isn't a confession of love - reads more like a suicide note -, but I can still be her friend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hell, sounds like what we both need is a friend. No relationship bullshit, just legitimately someone that understands how it feels to have hit rock bottom. Someone to rely on. Even if her "big revelation" is that she should go at it alone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I set the letter down on the desk, turning to face Fang with a swift, determined motion, that almost sends the chair flying to the side.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Only to be blinded by a yellowish-white flash, accompanied by a loud bang. Immediately afterwards my ears start ringing, and I find it hard to keep my balance, totally disoriented.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuck just happened?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I just barely register the distant sounds of glass shattering, and as my vision returns, I see myself facing the smoking barrel of a gun, some sort of revolver.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In Fang's hands.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without a second's pause, instincts take over. Through the haze I jump to the side, trying to get away from the threat. There are a million thoughts at once flooding the conscious part of my brain as I dash-dodge-run towards the kitchen.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh fuck oh shit I'm dead I'M SO FUCKING DEAD Fang is gonna kill me how long has she been standing behind me like that am I shot I don't feel like I'm shot what the fuck is she doing what the fuck should I do?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All combined with the oldest and noblest of all instincts a man can have: Needtogetaway!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The unmistakable sound of another gunshot reverberates in the air, though to my nigh-deaf ears it sounds as if it came from far away. But I'm way too fucking aware that the threat - the lethal fucking threat - is a mere meter or so from me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">From the corner of my eye I see Fang training the gun on me as she turns, following gunshot after another. I can see now that her expression is one of pain, tears running down her cheeks and ruining her mascara. She's clearly panicking now, having missed the first shot. Strangely though, the glass of lemonade is neatly set down by her feet, untouched.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not focusing on my escape and instead pondering over unimportant details proves a fatal mistake, however, as I trip over the Xrox cables and fall to the ground. At the same time the TV screen is virtually exploded by a bullet, plastic shards showering down on my back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And I'm certain that my head is next.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a thud I faceplant the floor, painfully biting my tongue too. Even so, that's the least of my worries right now. The feeling of impending doom is so strong that I'm very, very close to pissing myself. I can practically feel the bullet burning its way into my back already.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Any second now...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why are you still alive?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shake at the sound, shutting my eyes reflexively, fully expecting it to be another gunshot. Even once I realize it's Fang shouting, I still stay on the floor motionless - save for the shellshock-like quivers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't dare look at her, lest I give her a reason to finish the job. With this uncertain pause settling over us, I try sorting out my options fast as I can, looking for any means of survival. Admittedly though, with me on the floor and Fang pointing that gun at me, my chances are slim. There's no way she's gonna miss again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I seriously doubt that anyone here in Skin Row would give two fucks about a shootout, let alone call the cops. Even if they did, or if a tenant wanted to intervene, that's too much time. I probably only have a few seconds here before Fang pulls the trigger.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I could try to stall or sweet talk her, but there's just about no way my retarded ass could talk sense into her. I also demur my ability to force a single word out right now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thus I stay there, splayed out on the floor like a pathetic sack of shit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Seconds pass, then a whole minute, and I'm still not dead. The ringing in my ears fades away somewhat, and I finally hear it - sobbing. Curiosity overpowers my sense of self-preservation, and slowly, cautiously, I turn to the source of the sound.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang is again sitting on the edge of my bed, grabbing into her hair with both hands and rocking back and forth, a distraught expression on her face.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, and she still has the fucking gun too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I have no words to describe what I'm feeling right now, adrenalin pumping in my veins combined with the grave-cold sweat of fear on my back. I'm partially aware that this could be my chance to escape or to disarm Fang, if only I could get my body to move.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">On top of that I don't even know if I could make it, what with being locked in here with a mentally unstable psychopath.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A psychopath with a gun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I just now notice that Fang is mumbling something to herself, repeating the same phrase over and over. Try as I might however, I can't make it out. Fuck, she's seriously fucking lost it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuck do I do?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"F-Fang...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Soon as she hears my voice she stops with the rocking, mouth agape mid-mumble. Once again I'm very fucking afraid that I'm gonna be shot and killed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sadly I might be right too, as a moment later Fang aims the gun at me, staring me down with bloodshot eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm fucking sure that the crybaby face I'm pulling right now must be the most pathetic thing Fang has ever seen, but... Fuck! I don't want to go like this!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not like this!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My silent plea finds no empathy with Fang though, as I can clearly see her shaky finger crawling onto the trigger mechanism.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You should be dead!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The flow of tears starts anew, her face contorting into a painful grimace. At the same time, her finger tightens on the trigger.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Dead!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her arm is shaking uncontrollably now, but all I can see is that cold dark hole at the end of the barrel.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Like me!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her eyes widen, frothing mouth turning into a twisted growl, which I take as signs of her sealing the deal. I close my eyes, instinctively bringing my arms in front of my face protectively, flexing every single muscle in my body as I brace for the impact.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But once again, it doesn't come. I open my eyes right away, managing to catch the exact moment Fang puts the gun against her own head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"NO! FANG DON'T!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try to reach for her, stop her, but it's all too late.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I watch helplessly as Fang pulls the trigger, the whole world seemingly frozen in time. I've seen gore videos in the past, and I've even thought I've desensitized myself to such sights. Yet I still can't help but close my eyes again - I'm still only human, afterall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's no blast to split my eardrums. All I hear is a faint metallic clicking sound before total silence befalls the room.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even in my shocked state, it doesn't take long to connect the dots - she's out of bullets.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's another click, and several more as Fang desperately goes through the empty chambers. But there's no bang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With the threat lifted, I can finally will my body to move, tackling Fang onto the bed and twisting the gun from her grip. She puts up no resistance, as if all strength left her body.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We pretty much end up with me pinning her down by her writs in a cross-like position. In another situation, this might as well be something sexy. But not fucking now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's looking up at me, eyes still full of disbelief. And pain. But there's no fight in her anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why are you still alive?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She repeats her question from before, but it's little more than a whisper now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What does she mean though? How did I dodge those bullets? It was sheer fucking luck, not some Matrix-esque superpower.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We stay like that for a minute or so, at least till I'm sure that Fang won't try to get away - or harm me - if I get off of her. Nevertheless I let go of her wrists one at a time, and very cautiously at that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She stays there just laying like that though, staring up at the ceiling. As if some metaphorical bullet still fired from her gun, sapping her of her lifeforce.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I sit up beside her, really fucking unsure of what to do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Should I just fucking call the police? Or let her go? Should we try to discuss it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess of all solutions, that latter one is the least final. I'll call the cops on her afterwards. Still, I have no idea where to even start.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look around the room as I gather my thoughts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The TV is fucking gone. Positively obliterated. Half of the screen was clean torn-off by the blast. Just what the fuck caliber is that revolver?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The window is shattered, broken glass littering the desk and surrounding floor. I can already feel the cold wind biting my skin, and I loathe having to put up like cardboard or something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The impact of the other shots mark a clear trajectory on the wall as Fang chased me across the room. From here it looks like none of the bullets made it through to the hallway, for which I'm very grateful.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Against all odds, that glass of lemonade is still there.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Turning back to Fang, I'm not one bit closer to figuring out what to say. Guess I'll go with the obvious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What the fuck was that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She doesn't answer me with words, only with a frown and looking away from my general direction.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well that's just great. She doesn't even have a reason for trying to kill me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean yeah, her letter makes more sense now, all that "build my own future by all means necessary" stuff. But uh... Like, she had a perfectly good opportunity to shoot me in the back. Except she obviously didn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Was it because it's an awful disgusting thing to do, or because she honestly doesn't believe this to be the right call?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">How can I even be this calm about all that?! I almost just fucking died!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My hands are still shaking, sure, and I feel nauseous, but I'm like, I don't know. Accepting the situation?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why are you still alive?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her question angers me greatly, and I have to hold myself back from shaking Fang till she fucking explains herself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I DON'T KNOW! I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That finally does the trick, and Fang turns to face me, pulling her legs up into fetal position and sheltering herself with her wings. She looks so helpless and broken right now that I can almost forget her shooting spree.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Almost.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She takes a deep breath, her voice raspy as she continues to fight her tears back.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"H-how are you still you? H-how'd you make it after-- After--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How can you do everything right, by yourself, when I'm--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm... I'm s-so l-lossstttt--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even if there was more to her speech, loud sobs and wails take away her words. Before I could do anything, she completely covers herself with her wings into a feathery cocoon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not that there's anything I could add to the situation. I'm practically stupefied by this reveal of information.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still being me? Doing everything right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Where's she getting these fucking ideas from?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's the one with her life on track. She's the one with a family, the one who can still smile. The one who doesn't have to work a fucking 9-to-5 "student job" to just barely pay the bills. What the fuck is there in my bleak misery of a life that she can be jealous of?!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Long minutes pass till Fang's crying subsides, though her next words still come from under her wings - as if she was unable to even look at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm s-so s-s-sorryyy!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's all she can force out, voice failing her. Really though, I couldn't care less for her anguished cries. I stare at her with hatred in my eyes, much the same as her parents glared at me yesterday.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yesterday...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Feels like it happened in a different world entirely. To think that not an hour ago I wished we'd have another chance... It's as if we've crossed over into a different timeline or parallel world, one where everything's backwards.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If I try hard enough, I can still pretend like there's some distant possibility, some miracle fringe-technology, a bastardization of pseudoscience that could take me to a world where everything is all right, where Fang really did come over today to confess her feelings to me instead of whatever the fuck this was.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But I should accept it already.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There are no miracles.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For the following ten minutes Fang retreats into her cocoon, crying loudly. She refuses to talk to me even when I threaten her with physical violence or that I'll call the police.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Honestly I just want her out of my home and out of my life, so her ignoring me doesn't fucking help my mental state any.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I variably pace back and forth, attempt to collect pieces of the shattered window or to clean up the mess the TV screen has made... But nothing I do helps me calm down any, nor reduce the shaking of my hands.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In fact, as the shock and adrenaline fade away, I'm more on edge than before. Sweat collects on my face, heart beating like a drum.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel dizzy, nauseous. Like I'm gonna throw up any second now. Except I can't, not even after spending a whole minute dry-heaving over the sink.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"A-Anon--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hear Fang's voice coming from the bedroom-slash-livingroom, but at first I ignore it. I'm not in any state to attempt a conversation with her. Not now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"C-could you guh--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Could you get t-the p-pills fhh--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's wheezing, each one of her sentences abruptly ending with an asthma-like gasp.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"P-pills frommmhh--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wipe the saliva from my mouth and return to the bed, looking down at Fang's body. There's no emotion in me except for disdain. Her body is shaking real bad now, but I don't care.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What, is this withdrawal? Did she drug herself before coming here? Just the right push to get the job done? She couldn't even be sober when killing me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've never taken her for a junkie, but I guess I also never took her for a murderer.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"M-my b-b-ba--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's still pleading, barely able to talk anymore. But I just stand above her, emotionless.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Serves her right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At least if she overdosed herself or whatever the fuck, then it's done with. I don't even have to move a muscle to get my revenge.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hope that in her final moments, she'll understand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Understand that she's not only a burden like she wrote in her letter, but that all she can do is make things worse. For everyone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For her family, for her friends. For anyone too stupid to care.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That we've got estranged from eachother rightfully so, cause there's no-one to put up with his sad bullshit. Not Fang, not Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait, what did I just--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Suddenly, Fang's wings open up, her gaze meeting mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And in that instant, I falter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Those aren't the eyes of a drug addict. I should know, I see them daily at work.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">No. She's again panicked, but... Frail. Afraid.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As if she was drowning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her mouth opens, but no words come out anymore. Her eyes shift towards her bag, then back to me, begging.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I... I don't know what to do anymore. I can't leave her like that, but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even if it's not an overdose, it'd be so easy to just...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not do anything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If I don't help her... Fang... Would die?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Should I... Let that happen...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't move a muscle, not even as her body starts convulsing. My mind goes numb, yet conversely I can almost feel the blood circling in my veins. The throbbing of my heart like deafening drums, drowning out all other sounds. The feeling is more intense than anything I've ever felt my entire life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Tears form in her eyes as Fang realizes the situation. She probably understands, too, that she doesn't deserve my help. Not after what she's done.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But... Is it really alright for me to play God?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Looking down at Fang's writhing body, desperately clawing her way inch by inch to the edge of the bed, it feels... Good?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Finally... Finally, I have the power! I decide what happens now and nobody else! There are no stupid dinos to sneer at me for being different, no coworkers to patronize the loser!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A pitiful cry escapes Fang's lips, and her arms go limp. She turns onto her back, looking up at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her lips are moving, but I can't read them. Is she begging for help? Or saying she's sorry? Is she calling my name?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I bite my lip forcefully, the metallic taste of blood filling my mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her whole body flutters again, then she goes silent. As if on cue, the gravity of the situation hits me full force, lifting whatever spell I was under.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">FUCK</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just what the hell am I doing?! I can't let Fang fucking die!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I rush to her bag, ripping the zip open. My hands are shaking - again or still, who knows?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck! Fuck!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What did she say? Pills? Fucking pills, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I turn the bag upside down, emptying its contents onto the rugged carpet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...What? Is this a joke?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A dozen different canisters and syringes fall to the floor, rolling all over the place. Some of them even get under the bed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">FUCK!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Why are there some many? Which one does Fang fucking need?!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a quick look at her, but in my panicked state I can't tell if she's breathing or not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Don't you fucking die! You hear me?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I yell at her in a vain attempt to prolong the inevitable, all the while scanning the canisters for a way to determine which one to give her. It doesn't fucking help that my eyes are wet with tears now too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuck was I thinking?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">How could I have been so stupid?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My eyes move to Fang's limp body again...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is she...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of all things, the fucking tarot card I drew this morning flashes before my eyes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Death.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">FUCK</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's no time. I pick a syringe at random, its label reading "ADRENALINE - Epinephire - ROSC" with bold letters. Of course I have no idea what the fuck it means.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But adrenaline injections are a thing, right? That's not just movies and games, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck, why do I have to be so uneducated? If only I ever gave a shit about anything important...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I climb onto the bed, straddling Fang's body like before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">How the fuck do I administer an adrenaline shot? Aim at the heart, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">From this close I can tell Fang is still breathing, but just barely. She's obviously not conscious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I raise the syringe high, its sharp, thick needle pointing at Fang's chest. All I have to do is bring my fist down, and it'll all be right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...Right...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hesitate.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's alive, so... What if it was just a panic attack or something? Could I actually harm her by doing this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, won't stabbing her in the heart kill her?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Should I just leave her be?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">FUCK</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"PLEASE DON'T DIE!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Despaired, my hand rushes to action. I'm keenly aware of every little detail of the scene. The droplets of sweat on my forehead, the warmth of Fang's body, how her chest raises with each shallow breath...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The next few minutes, however, are all but a blur.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't dare aim at her heart, but her thigh instead. That's how they do insulin shots too, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At first, nothing happens. My heart sinks, the feeling of failure filling my entire body and soul.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To my great relief, not a few moments later Fang jolts awake, coughing and gasping for air, her muscles contracting to the point where she almost headbutts me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I fall off of her backwards, both out of fear and to give her space.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang just sits there for a couple of seconds breathing hard, staring at me and at the needle in her leg.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her expression is so intense and her next movement so quick that at first I'm afraid she's gonna attack. But no, she turns her back to me and goes for her bag - the remainders of it at least.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Searching through her armada of medication she eventually finds the right bottle, popping a pill or two straight into her mouth. I guess her hands are shaking too much for her to bother.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The room goes silent after that, save for our labored breathing. This time I'm on the bed, and Fang is standing. The glass of lemonade is still on the floor, yet to be spilled.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang's legs give out fast, though, and she stumbles back to me. Well, back to the bed in any case.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Neither of us knows what to say.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Did I do it? Did I save her?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It takes me a few tries to formulate the words, my voice hardly cooperating.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Aryouga-- A-Arayo--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Are you g-gonna be okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Breathing erratically still and unable to make eye contact, Fang gives me a quick nod, then pulls the syringe from her thigh. There's some blood, but I guess I didn't fuck up that much. Thank god her fashion sense includes ripped jeans...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After that she sets her back to the wall, pulling her knees up protectively.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Silence settles over us anew, only broken by the sounds of Skin Row coming from the busted window. A gentle breeze rolls in, catching into Fang's silvery hair and making it stick to her face, slick with sweat and tears.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I want to ask her just what the hell happened here, but I can't produce a single word.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So I can only guess.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Something heart related? It has to be. I mean, that couldn't have been an allergic reaction just now - would adrenaline have even worked then?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But she's never told me anything about that, not even back when...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then there's the whole murder attempt thing also, like I could ever forget. Except it goes both ways now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh Fang, just what are we supposed to do...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We stay like that for a long time. For hours, probably. Feels like it anyway. Just sitting on opposing ends of the bed, stealing glances at eachother and listening to the melody of Skin Row.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">People shouting, cars blaring their horns and the occasional tire screech, dogs barking, the shrill cry of a baby somewhere in the distance. Honestly, I've never noticed how lively it can be outside. Must be the weekend.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eventually we calm down, though Fang's breathing evens out way later than mine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's still there by the wall, head resting on her knees. Her expression is... Complicated. One that I can't read. She looks extremely tired too, likely an after-effect of the adrenaline shot - I don't ask.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It must be cold there by the window, evident by her shivering. I'm aware that I should probably offer her my jacket, but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Feels like even the most subtle movement will ruin everything. As if we were in a sort of stasis now, a stalemate. Although it's little more than our collective denial to face reality.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Take a step in any direction, and trouble is sure to follow. At least till we can postpone that step, things are fine.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It gives me some time to think as well. Not that I have the faintest idea of what I should be thinking anymore...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This morning, I was practically head over heels for Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Let's just put the fact that I sort of have a girlfriend aside.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then Fang tried to murder me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then I tried to murder her. Or like, watch her die.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I also wanted to kill her yesterday.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Today, however, I saved her life. Even though she wanted to shoot me in the back, point blank.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But with all that taken into account... I just can't find it in myself to hate her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I know that this was only an act of desperation. I mean, we literally just met yesterday for the first time in months. She couldn't have been plotting this for long.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Plus, she tried to kill herself. That contradicts her letter, in which she claimed to strive for a new kind of future, one that she builds alone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There'd be no need to get me involved either, if only for revenge. But I don't think Fang would do that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I also refuse to believe that she could murder someone in cold blood.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Me, on the other hand... If I had a gun on me at the concert, who knows how that scene would have ended? Maybe I would have shot whatsherface way before my blood boiling over Fang. There could have been many casualities if I went on a rampage there...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then again, I didn't plan for that to happen either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, I cannot ignore what Fang has done today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But what do I do about it? I'm just as fucked up as she is, if not more so. The only difference is that I don't have access to a gun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is there even an answer to this puzzle?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't hate her, I can't act neutral, so... What does that mean? I should help her then?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even if I would - and even if I could -, we can't just buddy-buddy it up. Not after what happened.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take another look at Fang. She's still cooped-up there, in the exact same position she's been for, well, for however long we've been sitting here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's clearly cold, and I can't resist not offering her my jacket anymore.

I'm a nobody."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nobody I may be, but I can't pretend that I don't know the reason. I knew it as soon as I saw how her parents "protected" her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's not doing any of this for herself, because she's not even here anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There was a Fang once, sure.

As if she could only handle reality in so little packets. As if that barrier guarded another world, one that was only her own, a place where she could be safe.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But uh, yeah.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I suppose that's an angle I haven't considered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's really easy for me to act like a loner and a retard, cause nobody expect anything from me anyway. I'm not hurting anyone, only myself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">However I remember Fang telling me how bad her relationship with her parents got. Supposedly way worse than with Naser, and I've already seen firsthand how that was.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang's cries have subsided in the meantime, her feathery fortress opening up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Again, she keeps throwing glances at me every other second or so, but she's mostly staring at the sheets in front of her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm not sure if she's waiting for me to say something, or to go ahead and console her. I don't feel either would be a good idea.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As such, silence settles over us for the following handful of minutes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the end, Fang is the one to pick up the conversation - or whatever this is supposed to be.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Heart palpitation."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm caught off guard by the sudden change of topic.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That's what it was.

Yeah, I had to see a psychiatrist twice a week."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"For a pretty long time."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't see how the two things connect, so I just let her keep going.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I've had... Anxiety attacks."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"T-they weren't about you.

The shrink said I was afraid of losing myself in the process, or something like that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I guess that makes sense cause I had this thought that one day I'll wake up and forget who I really was behind my mask. Who I used to be."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"At first they only came at night, but... After a while I could barely focus on anything."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Like, I felt weak all the time."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Dad made me see a doctor, so..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Heart palpitations.

It had to be lightweight for uh..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Er, like, your ancestors had to fly a lot.

Read it in a book?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's pretty much the long and short of it.

That reminds me...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Did you know some dinos take dumps up to five kilograms?

It's such a genuine sound that at first I can't place it. I honestly did not expect it from a girl who tried to shoot herself in the head like an hour ago.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah, I might know something about that. Cause you know, Dad can be, umm..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You don't want to go to the toilet after him."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Uh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I force an awkward laugh, though it sounds more like a cat being choked to death.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Did you read that in your book too?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With our conversation taking such a weird turn, we end up exchanging obscure dino facts for a good while, neither of us wanting to go back to a certain other topic. I can't tell if Fang is actually interested or if she's putting up an act, but I'm fine with either one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This is by far the most normal conversation I've had in a while.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And it started with dino droppings.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the back of my mind there's an ever-growing concern, that stalling will only make things harder on us. There's no way we won't have to make a decision about... Uh...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">About what, exactly?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, that's the problem. I don't even know where to begin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't just ignore an attempt on my life, and I seriously doubt Fang could look the other way about my nonchalant inaction as she almost died.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">On the other hand though, both of these stem from other issues entirely. Issues that we could maybe overcome together.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is that what this idle talk is about? Us trying to bury what happened today, so that we can act like it didn't?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or is that me projecting my wishes onto the situation?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To make matters worse, as we gradually accept eachother's existence, the more it starts to feel like good old times. It's pleasant, but at the same time it tears at my heart with a force I've never felt before...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Did you know that some feathered dinos have these tattoo-like markings that only come out under UV light?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No way, that's BS."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Whuh-- No it isn't! It's totally cool you dweeb!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm just about to retort when suddenly Fang recoils - with a blush and cute little yelp I might add -, putting both hands on her snout as if she said something she shouldn't have. The sudden gesture takes me aback as well, words stuck in my throat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What's more her expression gradually sours, turning away from me, looking both sad and embarrassed. I couldn't really explain why, but immediately it worries me. Maybe that's just my cavemen instinct kicking in, or maybe because that's how I would have reacted back when we last exchanged banter like that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Are you okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah, it's just..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You don't really look like a dweeb anymore."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her statement confuses me further, and without thinking about it I reach for my face, decorated by weeks old stubble - much as young adult me could produce. I guess I've never noticed, but it feels sullen too, probably due to all the weight I've lost recently.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well I have to admit, combined with the bags under my eyes, I'm sure I look more like a hobo than a nerd. I guess I just... I joked around that I must look like a meth addict or something, but on the inside I've never consciously made that connection before. I'm still as antisocial as ever and I still play vidya every now and again, so to me it didn't feel like such a big change.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It reminds me of something I've read once. Even if you have a consistent self-image, other people might perceive you different from one another, depending on just what aspects of yourself you let them know about. So to Fang I might have been a loveable dweeb once, and maybe I still think of myself along those lines, but for instance my coworkers never even knew me other than "that weird guys who never talks".</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Could it be that Fang, too, is just now realizing that I'm not exactly the carefree lad I used to be?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Regardless, she takes charge of the conversation again. Albeit for a very short time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What happened to you, Anon? How did things--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She cuts herself off abruptly. More precisely, a loud beeping sound does.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her eyes go wide, scrambling to her bag fast as she can.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, fuck! Fuck! I've gone over my curfew!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...You have a curfew?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Although it shouldn't surprise me at this point, I still can't mask the pity from my voice. It's not even that late, like, the sun is still way up. Late afternoon? Something like that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang doesn't answer me, focusing her attention on collecting her meds. She must have noticed that a few items are missing, looking under the table and the bed for them. Maybe I'm just imagining it, but it kinda looks like her breathing is getting rugged again, so this could actually be a big enough deal to get a minor panic attack over.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her movement suddenly freezes, however, once she notices something else on the floor.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The gun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A heavy atmosphere fills the room at once, tension returning. Neither of us knows what to say or do, entranced by the mere vision of the weapon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Usually, one would expect a gun laying on the ground to be at a crime scene, surrounded by bodies and blood. We came very close to just that today, too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the end, Fang puts it into her bag without any comment, making very sure not to look me in the eye while packing the rest of her stuff.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once she's done she takes another good look around, inspecting the destruction left in her wake. That and the lemonade I've offered her, inanimate survivor of her assault.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She still wouldn't look at me, not even as she addresses her next few words to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm gonna pay for these, I swear."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't know what to reply to that. "Yeah, you better"? I guess it goes without saying now that I won't report this to the police. So I end up saying nothing, sitting on the bed as I have this whole time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With her back turned to me, Fang steps up to the door, lingering there for a while.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe she wants to say she's sorry.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe she's thinking about how to better kill me next time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe she's worried if her parents found out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't even know if she's told them about her coming here, so that could mean trouble for her too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I-- I um..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I usually have lunch on the roof. You know, behind that little shed?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without giving me a chance to respond she rushes out the door, slamming it shut behind her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For the next few seconds I listen to her footsteps echoing in the hallways.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Only as I robotically move to latch the locks, only as I'm left alone with the rubble, only as the silence returns do I realize... Yeah... These past few hours? They really have happened.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I spend the rest of the afternoon cleaning up, trying not to overthink the situation. But there's just so much on my mind right now, I can't even make sense of it. Fang's identity issues combined with those of my own, her heart problems for which I'm starting to blame myself, the attempt on my life and how it's starting to make less and less sense from Fang's point of view, what if she gets caught, so on...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've never thought I'd say this, but I want so desperately to just talk to someone, to have them listen to my problems.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, this should be a no-brainer. I should talk to Stella. As my girlfriend, she is THE person I should turn to with these things.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But would she care?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, she couldn't act as if this wasn't a serious topic, could she? I almost fucking died.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">How much should I even tell her? What if she'd insist on calling the police or something else I don't want to do?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't even know why I'm not going to the police myself, it's probably cause I see this as the only chance I have getting close to Fang again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To help her get better, surely. Nothing more.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the end, I simply send Stella a message, asking her to call me when has the time. I estimate that it should give me at least a few more hours to think about everything, maybe even a day or more. By that time, I should have a more complete idea of what to do. Hopefully.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Right after sending the message my stomach rumbles, reminding me that I haven't eaten anything all day. We've never touched the snacks I bought while Fang was here, and I had to throw them away too, lest risking gulping down a few shards of glass.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The only thing I didn't touch was the glass of lemonade on the floor. I don't even know why. It was so improbable that it would go unspilled throughout the surrounding storm that it would feel wrong to do anything with it. Plus it served as a reminder that the scene straight out of an action movie really did happen. Here, in this room, to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shake my head, adamant not to start analyzing the situation yet. I want to put some distance between me and everything that happened. I don't want to draw the wrong conclusions, and I don't want to spend the whole night anxiously tossing and turning, mulling over every possibility.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've been letting my emotions get the best of me way too much lately, so...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I just want to calm down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Normally I'd play Xrox, but that was out of the question. So I end up heating the lasagna and brewing some instant coffee, for the first time in a long while eager to subject myself to reading about dinosaur relationships. I honestly never could have guessed that it would serve as a catalyst for bonding with Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I spend my meager meal learning about different seasons for different kinds of dinos. Like preening and stuff. I also look up those UV light thingies Fang mentioned, and to my surprise, they seem to be a real thing. I fail to see the evolutionary benefit in it, but I guess birds do birds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If it wasn't for the cold night air coming from the window, I could almost forget that this wasn't a regular day in my mundane life. Sadly, I had no cardboard on hand and couldn't find any - that wasn't torn or mushy - by the dumpsters either, so I just drew the curtains for now. It's getting fucking cold though, even with the heater right by my feet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not wanting to catch a cold I opt fast to go to bed, seeking the protection of the sheets. Those little drops of Fang's blood are still visible, and I doubt they'll ever come out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Despite my best efforts to keep THOSE thoughts at bay, I still can't not think about them. Especially about what Fang said as she left the flat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She has lunch on the roof.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That would explain why I've not seen her in the cafeteria. But more importantly, the only reason she'd tell me about it was to imply she wants me to meet her there.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But should I really?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't deny, those few minutes we've spent exchanging weird dino facts and light insults... I don't know when was the last time these past three months I've felt so happy. It's not even about happiness, more like... It was normal. It wasn't me trudging through the rain to a workplace I hate, or to school where everyone hates me. It wasn't me staying up all night just to be ignored by Stella, and it wasn't me staring up at the ceiling at night, wondering where things went wrong.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was... It was normal. I've felt normal. Like a guy my age actually should.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">From a very young age, as a generally introverted person, I knew very well that a big part of the reason why I've hated the people around me was that I've envied them. Even if I never would have admitted to it aloud.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And I also know that I've had it better than most with Stella, before she moved away. Not counting the whole cheating thing, naturally.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But since then, it's all been downhill. And as I've concluded a few days ago, not all of it was my doing. It was as if some higher force was dead set on keeping me down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe it was a form of karmic balance for fucking up Fang's life. Probably not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, I find myself chuckling about the idea. Karmic balance? Keep drawing those tarot cards and I might just end up like Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nah...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shouldn't blame my insecurities on magic and stuff. That prediction from earlier, death, it didn't come to pass either. Surely, I was just being silly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Surely.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The next day as I woke up, I've half expected things to turn back the way normally were. The window not to be shattered, the TV not to be blown up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But no.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In a way, I've felt thankful for it. It helped solidify the facts in my mind, as I could no longer pretend she was just a dream. Then again, getting into a shootout was so out of my league that it might very well could have been a dream.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella never did call me, which meant she's either gonna do it in the next few hours, or way later at night. That should match her work schedule. Granted that she has work today and that her mother has no other activities planned.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even on weekends, Stella often had to work. I guess we were the same in that regard. Except I've never really learned what her actual job title was. She was like an assistant or something, so from time to time she had to make an appearance for meetings and stuff. Like I don't know, to flip the slides on the projector or something?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang hasn't messaged me either. Now that worried me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If she had a curfew it wouldn't be a stretch to think that her punishment would be getting her phone confiscated - as if she was little kid -, but... Did she get caught with the gun?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I keep expecting the police to come get me, sirens blaring across Skin Row. Technically I should count as a victim, I guess, but could me not turning Fang in mean that I was her accomplice now? Or are we talking about two separate crimes here? Theft and attempted murder? I don't even know. I'm too afraid to try contacting her in any case.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My thoughts are so all over the place that I forget today's tarot card, rushing to get to work through many-an-alley, avoiding the main streets as much as possible. Like I was some fugitive.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm on edge even as I arrive at the store. Fortunately, the reshelving has me occupied enough to eventually get my mind off of the whole getting arrested idea. Whatshername isn't in yet, so I hope I can dodge her today. I've got no funny looks from the others, so maybe she hasn't outed me as a creep - so far anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I check on my phone every now and again to see if there's a message from Fang or Stella, but otherwise I keep focused on the task at hand. In fact I get so caught up in packing stuff that I don't even take my lunchbreak.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Some of the guys try talking to me, and they get the usual grunting treatment. I do listen in on their conversations this time though, trying to figure out if a shootout in Skin Row or the police commissioner - or whatever the fuck Fang's dad's rank was - getting into trouble made the news or not.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess the former isn't likely to make big ripples, nobody even came to check in on me; while the latter probably wouldn't make it into the news for a few days yet. If at all. I mean, it could just be an internal police affair.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Slowly, ever so slowly, the day winds down without anything out of the ordinary happening. Even whatshername is absent.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Honestly, I can't tell how grateful I am. For both.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm pretty tired though, having spent the day moving boxes and packing the shelves. Exhausted, even. Still, I have the foresight to "borrow" some cardboard. With some luck that should resolve the broken window situation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Should make it less sucky in the very least. Maybe I can tackle on multiple layers and that'll do something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wobbly as my legs are, I risk taking the bus home. If I haven't heard from the police so far, it's unlikely they'll come after me now. At least that's what I keep telling myself, even as I try my best to keep my identity concealed - meaning I pop the collars of my jacket, attempting to hide my face like the weirdo I am.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I end up spending way too much time patching up the window, working around the remaining shards of glass and trying not to fall to my death. Nevertheless, I put three layers up rigorously, even going as far as draping an old pullover over it on the inside.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It uh, it looks like something straight out of a ghetto. So really, par for the course here in Skin Row. Not that I've really expected more with my level of craftsmanship.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Looks aside, the effects of it can be felt momentarily, the struggle of my poor electric heater actually making a difference.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And yet I keep my jacket on till the very last minute, practically falling face first into the pillows while still wearing outside clothes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm a little saddened that Stella didn't call - and I'm still anxious about Fang as well -, but I'm too tired to really care. I realize that it's not even the repacking in itself that wore me down, having been awake for the vast majority of the last 72 hours is way more likely a culprit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not to mention all the excitement I've endured.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The morning goes by in a flash. Returning to old habits, I hit snooze three times over and if it wasn't for the knowledge that I have to meet Fang today, I would very likely call in sick. Alas, I stuff some moldy cereal in my face, and jump in and out of the shower in less than a minute.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I entertain the idea of shaving, though very briefly. I don't have the time, and I can't be bothered anyway. I'm not that keen on the whole hobo act - especially considering that my quote-unquote beard only grows in thin patches -, but it'll have to do for a while yet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This time I remember to draw a card, however. In fact, I don't even have to touch it to know which one it is. Different from the rest of the pack, torn in half and glued back together. The Lovers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The very same card Stella once tore up and threw in my lap, something I interpreted back then as her way of breaking up with me. Of course she didn't know which card it was at the time - she practically destroyed the entire deck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We ended up staying together, sure, but still. It's not a nice memory. Even recalling it puts a bitter taste in my mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe I shouldn't have kept the card afterall...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I wonder if there's any significance to the last one I drew having to do with death and new beginnings. I don't even know if I'm trying to match it up with my meeting with Fang, or our fallout with Stella.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I do my best to banish these thoughts as I make my way over to Volcano High, with little success. Once again, though, I keep my eyes wide open, looking for any signs of Fang. I'm hoping that after our encounter this weekend, she won't play hide and seek anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I also realize that the girl I chased into the bathroom last week - the one I wouldn't let out by being a creep in the hallway - probably wasn't Fang. At the concert she was VERY surprised to see me still farting around.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oops.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As to be expected though, I don't see Fang till lunch period. Not physically anyway, but she did send me one message.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"dont bring lunch"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm a little confused by it, and at first I'm afraid she's calling off the meeting. Then it hits me that all she means, presumably, is that she has it covered. Maybe her class ended earlier and she could scope some kick-ass pizza or something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That'd be really nice, cause I can virtually still taste the sawdust from the cereal. The weather is relatively nice too. Mostly sunny, with just a bit of wind, carrying leaves of all colors.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, the closer I get to my destination, the more on edge I am, ending up idling at the foot of the staircase for over a whole minute.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What if this is a trap?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What if Fang will try to shoot me again?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or push me off the roof? Poison me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I really, really desperately want to believe she just wants to make amends. I refuse to think that the girl giggling over dino crap could be an actual psychopath.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But... The sight of her pointing her gun at me is practically etched onto my retina. Loud bangs, flashing lights, that feeling of fear...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I want to believe in Fang, without a doubt I do, but... I'm afraid.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Guided by a sudden idea I reach for my phone, dialing her number. It takes a while, but she eventually picks up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So uh, you're uhh... On the roof, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, hurry up! Food's getting cold."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">H-hurry, huh?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's not a trap. It can't be.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang wouldn't do that. She's not currently aiming the revolver at the door, waiting for the very second I make my appearance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...Right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah, okay. I'll be there in a sec."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"C-cool."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With her last statement, I sense some anxiety in Fang's voice. Did she catch onto the fact that I'm suspicious of her? Or...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She hangs up before I could reply.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a deep breath, climbing the stairs with shaky legs. My resolve falters with every other step, but I hang on. I keep repeating one phrase in my head, as if it was some mantra.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Traps are gay.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Traps are gay.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Traps are gay.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Traps are gay.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's not exactly right for the given context, but is's the only thing that keeps me going. A distraction more than anything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang's not gay haha!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So she wouldn't lay a trap for me haha!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not like last time, she's not so desperate anymore, right? Haha!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The creaking of the door is deafening, and I'm almost expecting the oh-so-familiar sound of a gunshot to follow. Is this what PTSD is like?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Seconds pass, and there's no bullet to splatter my gray matter over the concrete paneling.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I let out a breath I didn't even notice I was holding, stepping out into the light.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Over here!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Following her voice, I see Fang waving at me from the other side of the shed. Instead of a gun she's holding a blue lunchbox, decorated with all sorts of musical instruments. Her clothes are more on the tradwife end of the spectrum today, some sort of gown. It's to keep up appearances in public, I guess.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Point is, she's very fucking not threatening looking.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But... That could be a thing too. To lull me into a stupor, just before she stabs me in the back. Then there's the possibility of poisoning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nonetheless, the very fact that my gamble paid off and I didn't die puts me at ease - somewhat. The tensions in my shoulders drop, and I can finally stop saying "traps are gay" in my head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm still cautious as I approach Fang, and... Honestly, once I'm standing before her I just don't know what to do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Uh...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's looking away too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This is awkward.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"S-so uh--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang interrupts me almost immediately, nearly hitting me square in the stomach as she suddenly hurls her package at me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Here!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her voice is high pitched, she's almost shouting. Plus she won't make eye contact, blushing hard. What's that all about?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Uh...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That's um... A nice lunchbox?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I really don't know what to do with it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And where's my food, too, huh? Now that the existential dread subsided, I'm getting kinda hungry.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My helplessness seems to anger Fang, though she's doing her best to keep things civilized. I can tell.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Christ, take it already you dork!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She pushes the box into my hands before I can really figure out what she means - then it hits me like a wall of bricks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With a little fumbling around I open the thing, revealing a neatly organized meal. Peas and carrots, mushrooms, some kind of meat I can't place cause it burned into a crisp. There's even a cookie or two in there.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All in all, it looks very edible. Minus the meat, though it's miles better than anything I could make for myself. The cafeteria really went all out on this one.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"S-so...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look up at Fang, only to find out she's still avoiding my gaze. Her face is brighter red than it was, too. She's produced another box in the meanwhile, its contents matching the one in my hand, with the exception of the cookies.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, thanks."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's getting awkward again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang is mumbling something under her breath, but I can't quite make it out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What's that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another mumble.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She takes a deep breath, probably fighting the urge to slap the food right out of my hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry about the meat..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh uh... It's no problem. Guess the lunch lady had a bad day."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For a second there Fang opens her mouth to say something - something nasty I'm sure -, in the end turning away from me entirely, retreating behind her wings yet again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm really baffled by her behavior. I mean, it's a way better than her trying to kill me, but... She's seriously one "Not like I want to" line away from being the biggest tsundere cliché on earth. Except more aggressive.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's a whole lot different than the deer-in-headlights spell she was under back at the concert and at my place.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is this somehow my fault? Like, did the old Fang resurface after our talk?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe I shouldn't think so highly of myself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not wanting to bother Fang in any case, I patiently sit down by the wall, further examining the contents of the lunchbox. I just now notice that there's a little label on it too, its letters spelling my name.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It makes me feel all warm inside - quite the change after the chill I've felt climbing the stairs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...It's an apology..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...The food..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...I've made it..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her wing-shield-thingy is still up, making it hard to make out every one of her words. I think I got the gist of it anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But wait, she cooked this? Like, in the kitchen, apron on and spatula in hand?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Since when does Fang cook?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This might be the most improbable part of our whole reunion. Way less believable than the Columbine reenactment I was afraid she's gonna pull on me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-you... Made it?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can barely speak I'm so awestruck.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, okay, with that gown and all I can sort of see her being someone's wife but... Come on! This is Fang I'm talking about here!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She belongs on the stage, not by the stove!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It was um, M-Mom's idea...."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Contrary to my bewildered state, Fang seems to have calmed down, lowering her guard. Her face is just as red as before, though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I watch her take her place next to me on the ground, pulling a couple of plastic forks from her bag. I can't help but notice the bottles of pills in there too, causing me to cringle a little.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang acts as if she didn't notice, probably for both of our sakes. She also doesn't comment on my awkward fidgeting around as I accept the fork she offers me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Feels weird to be sitting next to Fang - a girl - like this. I'm very much not used to it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Would it make things worse if I scooted away or sat opposite of her? Yeah, probably...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm just about to accept the situation and chomp down on a carrot as I realize something, panic settling in again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Wait, your mom? You told her about--?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Seems like Fang was anticipating the question, lowering her fork with a sigh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I wish I could have, but... I just told her I've accidentally tripped a classmate over, so I wanted to make up for it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Uh-huh, okay, but--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"S-so the gun...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This time Fang's calm expression wavers, her wings jerking into motion seemingly on instinct. She subdues the urge to hide, clearing her throat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It-it's uh-- It's okay. I've put it back. Dad doesn't know."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So it was her father's revolver afterall. I mean it was kinda obvious, but it's good to know for sure anyway. Makes it less likely that she could carry it around all day.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hate myself a little that I'm still so on guard, even if it's for good reason.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The discussion pretty much dies after that, silence growing over us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without anything better to do, I dig into the meal Fang has prepared for me, and from the corner of my eye I can see her doing the same.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Honestly, it's pretty good. I mean, it's nothing special, but I have no idea when was the last time I ate anything home-cooked. Probably something Stella brought over for a date or something.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Remembering those times makes me feel weird all over again, what with sitting next to another girl. As such, I force myself to focus on the present.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Um..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's um, really good. Thank you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can practically feel the blood rushing to my face, and I can now totally understand why Fang didn't want to look at me earlier.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Although this way I can't see her reaction, I'm pretty sure Fang is blushing too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"J-Just eat it you dork, it's nothing special."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well yeah, that's exactly how I described it too, but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I mean, it's a lot better than anything I could make, so..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Huh? You've never cooked anything before?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I uh... I've made sandwiches?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I half expect Fang to make fun of me, so her laughter doesn't even surprise me. Her next comment, however, does.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Want me to uh, t-teach you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I-- I mean-- I'm not that good myself, so um--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Like--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once again her wings raise in rhythm with her short, panicked breaths. This time I intervene though, carefully but firmly keeping the feathered appendage down on my side, looking Fang in the eye.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah, I'd like that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Unable to retreat behind her wings, Fang instead hides her face with her hands. I don't blame her for it, my heart is basically pounding right out of my chest.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm not even sure why I did that just now. Maybe cause I hate seeing Fang as a scaredy-cat. I don't know.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">From behind her palms Fang nods at me, acknowledging the deal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Right after, the bells ring, signaling the end of lunch period. And now I hate myself for spending so much time worrying about inane ideas like Fang being some sort of assassin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We pack our respective lunchboxes hastily, though when I try to give mine back to Fang she refuses, telling me to take it home cause "I won't get anything better anyway". I don't argue with her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">On top of that, as I try to leave the roof Fang grabs the sleeve of my jacket.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"C-can I--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Fang]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...See your shoulder?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Huh? My shoulder?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm so surprised by her question that I don't even know what to say. I just nod at her like a mute.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A second later Fang gets up on her tippy-toes, running her slender fingers below my shirt by my neck, pulling it aside so she can get a view of my skin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then I understand what she meant.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Of course.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The scars from our fight with Stella. Sure they left their marks, but I've already forgotten about them. It was Fang herself who patched me up, so in a way she's entitled to see the result of her handiwork.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Let's just forget that it was also her who caused half those wounds to reopen not a day later, and that the bandages were had to be redone by an actual medical practitioner.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Forgetting is easier than I've thought, though, as a girl touching me like this is way too fucking intimate. Feels like it, anyway. Especially considering that I can feel her hot breath over my neck, slipping under my shirt.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Luckily her inspection takes no longer than a few seconds, and Fang lets go of me with one last sigh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She doesn't say anything either, jogging to the staircase and slinking into the shadows, leaving me there with conflicted feelings.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The rest of the classes go by normally, though I can barely pay attention to any of them. Understandably so.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In fact, my inability to answer his questions angers one of the teachers so much that I'm put into detention. I can thankfully talk my way out of it today as I have work after classes, but I still have to fling by on wednesday.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Really though, I couldn't care less. I find it very hard to make sense of all the stuff that happened on the roof. Most notably Fang cooking lunch for me, and her offer to teach me how to cook. Like, these things are very fucking close to how I'd imagine dating a girl.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Except, of course, that we're talking about Fang. With her, dates used to go along the lines of smoking cigarettes and strumming random notes on her guitars, or walking around town trying to snag some booze.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't even tell if it was Fang or Lucy who I met today. I mean, clearly, it wasn't Fang the way I knew her. But with the constant anger management she had to put up, and the anxiety... Like... I seriously doubt that's how she acts in front of her parents when she's Lucy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What does it all mean?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I have no idea.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">One thing is clear at least, she's over the whole cutting me out of her life thing. Like, she flew over it in a monster truck while on fire and doing a backflip.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It would be a truly, truly outrageous lie to say I'm mad at her, it's just... Things are becoming way too complicated. At least it seems I won't have to worry about Fang getting caught stealing her father's gun. Now there's a weight off my shoulder.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once I arrive at the store I deliberately try to shift my attention from this dilemma over to packing the shelves. It's a partial success, at least till whatshername arrives.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She doesn't come near me for the first few hours, and with the end of my shift getting close I'm starting to hope she won't either. I can see her throwing glances my way the entire time, but I'm not sure what it's about. Maybe she thinks I'm in love with her or something?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah, fat chance.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Even if I was, I like to think I'd have the spine not to grovel by her feet after the way she treated me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then again, maybe she simply wanted to apologize. If Fang could get over her issues, maybe she can too. I should at least give her the chance, I guess.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's the only reason why I don't punch her in the gut the moment she approaches me. Still, I don't turn to face her, packing various cans on the shelves.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey Anon!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh-huh..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There's a pause. She's probably reconsidering things.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"S-so after the concert um, I hooked up with this guy..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Went back to his place and all that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...Okay? Why tell me about that now? Or like, ever?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is she just trying to rub it in my face or something? I'm getting slightly more irritated.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"C-could you um, come over and tell Mom I crashed at your apartment instead?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What? Why?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm so surprised at her request that I almost drop the can I was holding, very nearly knocking a few other items off the shelf.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well um, you see, you made a good impression on her so..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I don't want her to be mad at me cause I want to see Nathan on friday, and she wouldn't--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Are you for fucking real?!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't stop myself from blurting that out. I'm baffled by the entire situation, yet disgusted at the same time. I know for a fact that she absolutely doesn't care about me, but I should still help her? How can one person be so vain?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No, thank you."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"C'mon you dork, I'll go on a date with you for real!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"No."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She comes closer, running her hand over my arm, massaging it gently. What's up with girls being so touchy today?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Aww, please Anon, so how about I suck your--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Now that's just fucking repulsive.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shove her away, fed up with her attempts at seducing me. I'm careful so that I don't knock her over, for the sake of the shelves around us more than anything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How about you fuck off, huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Why are you even talking to me? I don't care enough to know your name, remember?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her expression darkens, looking around if there's anyone within earshot of us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I could just tell everyone what a pathetic simp you are, how about that?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hah! Is that the best she can do?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You think I care? Yeah, go right ahead! Everyone already thinks that I'm a freak, so--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So what if I tell 'em you raped me?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"W-what...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My blood freezes in an instant. S-she wouldn't--</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She can't!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Certainly, I would have hated hearing casanova insults for weeks on end from everyone, but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh yeah, maybe I'll go to the police too. I'm sure people remember the guy making a scene at the concert. And the cab guy might remember your lame ass pickup line."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So, what's it gonna be?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Raptor Jesus on the fucking cross, just who is this girl?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can totally believe she's not bluffing, but... Then how does the entire Christian rock thing come into the picture? Was all that about just one guy? Why even bother with the concert then?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"F-friday, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Her eyes narrow, arms crossing over her modest breasts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Girl]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You better make it happen. For your own good."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"O-okay. I um--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'll call you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She doesn't answer, which I take as a sign of her approval, and that I should get lost.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hesitate for a second, unsure if there's a way to fix the situation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the end I leave her behind as she graciously takes over packing the shelves for me. My shift is just about over anyway, so I posthaste call it a day and head the fuck home.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well that certainly made everything more complicated.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or maybe it hasn't?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All I have to do is show up at their place for an hour maybe. That's very doable.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But... I don't want to become her slave or errand boy. If I agree to this, that's practically me signing my own death wish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe I could report her threat to the police? What could they even do about it? Other than laugh in my face, a grown man bullied by an angsty teenager.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Just why did I lower my guard around her? I've spent like five minutes deliberating if I should ditch Fang, yet I couldn't-- Christ! What's wrong with me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Huh? Wait a minute.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe if I got closer to Fang till friday then I could talk to her father about this?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, he hates my guts, but... Say I fixed Fang-- No. If I fixed Lucy up for them, then...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe he'd be thankful enough to hear me out?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hate myself for even thinking about using Fang like that, but I mean, if this is the only way I won't go to prison over a false rape allegation, then...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe I could escape to Mexico. Perhaps Rosa has family there who'd shelter me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or maybe I should go to France? Stella could talk her mother into letting me live with them till I find a job. If she still cares for me, that is.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But running away would just make it seem like I admitted to the rape charge, won't it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, this is a nightmare! I can't believe I'm being blackmailed by like a sixteen-year-old.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I really don't even want to consider it, but the prospect of sucking up to Fang's father seems more and more promising. Fang seemed like she wants to bury the hatchet, and she's certainly fucked in the head enough to go back to being Lucy if I tell her to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hell, maybe I can even convince her that I'm helping her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The only problem is that I very possibly couldn't live with myself after that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, the other option seems to be jail. In the very least, on top of being a loser everyone would think of me as a rapist too, even if my name got cleared in court.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Once again, I hate that I have no one to talk to. Where's Reed when you need a miracle?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The thoughts about using Fang to get to her father haunt me for the rest of the day, and I can barely focus on anything I'm doing. In fact, I end up spending most of the time sitting on the bed and staring at the glass of lemonade on the floor. I don't even touch the delicious food Fang cooked personally for me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Stella eventually calls me, which I'm thankful for, even if I'm not one bit closer to figuring out what to tell her. Quite the opposite, really.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hope we can figure something out together, if she'll hear me out.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey sweetie!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh wow, I already forgot she calls me that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It feels surprisingly good to hear, maybe better than any other time I've heard her say it. It feels good to hear her voice too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A warm feeling spreads inside my chest, and it takes me some effort not to tear up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess it's like... Stella being her cute, aloof self is the only constant in my life right now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Anon?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"H-hey!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Is everything okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry I can't turn the camera on, I'm still on my way home."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That's um... It's okay."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So you've been to the office today?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, it's inventory week so I was helping the boss with copying and shredding stuff. I just didn't notice how the time flew me by."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Sorry about that, haha! So anyway, what did you want to talk about?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What indeed?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">For maybe the first time in my life, I've actually enjoyed meaningless chit-chat. It was just so nice to hear about Stella, to be part of her calm and normal world for just a little bit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But it's time to get back to the drama, then.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You uh, you remember Fang, right? She's a pterodactyl?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's a stupid question, but thankfully Stella takes it at face value, her tone only slightly sounding suspicious.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess it's a start.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Uh-huh, what's up with her?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, I uh, I met her at that concert the other day."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"At the Trinity for Hire one?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"That's the one."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I nod instinctively, not realizing that Stella can't see it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Actually I couldn't have told her even if the name was incorrect, cause I've never bothered to remember it. Not that it really mattered in the grand scheme of things.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"How's she doing?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Over the phone like this I can't tell if Stella actually cares about Fang, or if she's just being polite. Maybe she's trying to help me go on with the story.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I smile a little at that latter idea. Stella certainly should know me enough to assume I have something to tell her, even if I can't bring myself to it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She's uh... She's doing okay, mostly."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, so that's um... That's good?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, she... Actually she came over, and uh..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another pause. God, how can I even phrase this? What should I say?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Sweat collects on my forehead, hands starting to shake. I can clearly feel my pulse picking up too, heart beating away at my suddenly parched throat.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...Yea?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She wanted to uh, she uh..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"She wanted to beat me up again."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, that's not really the truth, but I don't want to be overly dramatic. For all intents and purposes, this should work too, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh gosh! But... Why? Is she still mad at us?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">At us.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's a very short phrase, yet those two words take me unprepared. It doesn't really help me coping with the situation any.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is Stella consciously acknowledging that there's still an "us"?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, she didn't ever say there wasn't, but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In any case, I can think about that later. I should answer Stella first.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In her letter Fang explicitly wrote that she wasn't mad at Stella, not that much at least. Then again, that whole letter could have been forged just to get to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Though she did say she's sorry after trying to shoot me, so uh...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I uh, I think she was. It's uh--"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Are you okay? Did she hurt you?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hold on a sec, I'll get off at the next stop so we can talk, okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Huh. She actually cares?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh fuck, I'm starting to panic now for real.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess I just expected Stella to brush me off like usual. I didn't even honestly think she'd contact me today.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm kinda shocked that the conversation hasn't devolved into us talking about mundane shit, like anime for instance - and oh how I would enjoy that right now. Maybe since Fang's name came up Stella is treating it seriously this time?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The one time I wish she didn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wait, if I intend to "get closer" to Fang, can I even tell Stella about it? Makes me feel like a dick after how worried she sounded, but it's not like I can ask her advice on how to cheat on her. Even if it's just for show so I can get to Fang's father.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, uh, you know, you can stay on the bus or whatever, it's fine. I'm not hurt cause Fang just took her gun and left so it's all good yeah? Okay I have to go now too, bye! Love you!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">By the end I'm talking way too fast, not giving one single opening for Stella to respond before I hang up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But wait, did I just say...?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh fuck, I totally said gun, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yup, and that fact isn't lost on Stella either, going by her next message.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"did u say gun???"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh god, she's calling me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuck what do I do?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Y-yeah?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Immediately, I'm bombarded by questions.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Gun? What gun? Anon are you hurt? What gun are you talking about? Anon?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fuckity fuck fuck!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">DAMAGE CONTROL</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">DAMAGE CONTROL</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Kshhhh-- Bad signal! Kshhhhhh-- Can't! Ksssh-- Hear you!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In the background I can clearly hear Stella further enquiring about the gun, but I hang up on her again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That uh, that went terribly wrong.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Shit. This is not good at all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">My phone is practically blowing up with new messages from Stella, so in my panic, I turn it off altogether.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's uh, I guess it's time to go to sleep, right? Gotta get up early for school! Haha!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Naturally, I can barely close my eyes let alone fall asleep.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I sorta felt like things would start to calm down after the rooftop meeting, but then it just kinda went back to nightmare mode zero to hundred in a snap. Makes me feel like a hypocrite for how long I was whining about my life being gray and boring, yet now there's no price I wouldn't pay just so things could go back to normal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Might as well have that soul-searching-session right now, it's not like I'll get any sleep either way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So... How does this work?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'll uh...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Okay.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Who am I?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's a pretty standard question to ask while soul searching, I suppose.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Not that, of course, I could answer it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try going about it in simple terms, like "I'm a nerd" or "I'm just me". But while the former doesn't feel a satisfactory answer anymore, the latter is too vague to be of any help.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So uh, I guess... Why isn't it a satisfactory answer?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Cause like, I'm too adult now? Like I have a job and stuff and don't play video games all day? I've never been the booksmart kind of nerd, just the video-gamey nerd.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean at best I'm a young adult. I still have a lot of years before me - hopefully. But then is that who "me" is? A nameless nobody adult, one out of many?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Huh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, that's been sorta me for a while. Like, the entire past decade?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't really aspire to be anything more than a face in the background, so that people would leave me alone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So that's it? I'm just reaping what I sow?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That would be a plausible answer, but I'm not too eager to accept it. On the one hand it's too depressing, but on the other I honestly don't feel like that's all there is to it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That's because in the end I DID let my guard down. I did go out of my way to befriend people. Hell, I've even got a relationship or two!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It should be proof enough that it's not just that my antisocial behavior came back to bite me in the ass. I won't deny that I probably have several problems stemming from this very issue alone, but it can't explain everything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So... Who am I?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This isn't really going anywhere, I can't give a more detailed answer than before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then uh... What are some things I do that define me? Like, how do other people see me?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, I guess a lot of them see me as a weirdo and a loner, but... For one thing, I can hold down a job.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In fact, I've never gotten one single complaint from the managers. I've never got promoted either, but I guess this should mean I'm normal on some level.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't think I'll really get a better answer, so fine, let's suppose I'm not a lost cause, and that my misery should have external reasons.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, what's the deal with Stella?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With all the "missed" online dates and mindless babble she subjects me to, I was seriously beginning to think she moved on. There's an unquestionable distance between the two of us, and I honestly don't feel like I'm part of her life anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But the way she acted today - or shit, is it past midnight yet? - proves that she still does care about me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, okay, I assume if I had a friend I'd be pretty upset learning that they almost got shot and tried to hush it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And yet Stella still calls me sweetie, and she's never once brought up the topic of breaking up. Sure, she can be in the same boat as me and either too scared to, or just letting things run their natural course, but...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's not like she couldn't just stop replying to my messages altogether. If she wanted to really cut me out of her life, she could do it easily.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But she didn't.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So what's that mean?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Again, I try simple terms. It's cause she's still in love with me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With this reasoning, it would be really easy to explain why she still talks to me and calls me sweetie, and why she got so upset over the prospect of my demise.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But there's just something wrong with this picture. If she was in love with me, why doesn't it feel like it? Why am I having these doubts?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is this just how distance relationships are, and I'm reading too much into it? That doesn't sound right either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Fine, once again let's just assume the most plausible explanation, and say Stella still feels for me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So what am I going to do about it?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I really wish I could fix things with her. Not only that last phone call, but all of the fuckups I've piled up till now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess I could be proactive and go out of my way to call her more often, to ask her about her day and all that. Just be extra nice. Regardless of how I feel about the futility of such effort, it's not like I could just call her and try.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After the way I've sperged out on her, it'll take a lot of time to smooth things over. That is, if she'll even let me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Like, I guess I can just tell her I've panicked? That is the truth, essentially. She should know me enough to understand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But then I'd have to explain why I wanted to lie to her in the first place. Not a nice - or easy - conversation to have.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Especially since it concerns my feelings towards Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So uh, let's talk about Fang, I guess.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't even have to think about a question, it throws itself at me right away. A very prevalent one at that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Am I in love with Fang?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I... Don't know.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hopes and fears, dreams and rationale clash in my brain, in my heart.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't deny that I feel something. But can it be love?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Bad as it sounds, still I ask myself: what reason do I have to love Fang?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's not the kind of person she used to be. If it wasn't for my inexplainable hopes that I can "bring her back", would I have any reason to be friendly towards her? If she was anyone else, would I care?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Again, I don't know.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Or maybe I'm convincing myself that I don't, cause I wouldn't like the answer?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Doesn't that mean that I WANT to be in love with her? Or that I actually am, and refuse to think I'm not?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What reason would I have to want to be in love with her if I actually am not? Could it be that I'm using her as an outlet because of the whole Stella situation?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess that wouldn't be all that different as to why I agreed to go on a date with whatshername.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Still, I care for Fang. In my soul I know it. Honestly, I do care.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't want to see her suffering like this, and I think I can help her. Plus the way she acts, I feel like she's trying to be friendly too. Maybe even more than friendly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Would I stop her advances?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Do these questions really mean anything when my current plan is to deceive her?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If I successfully push her all the way to being Lucy, well, maybe I could act like her friend, even her boyfriend, but... Would it mean anything?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Perhaps I could lie to myself too, accept some vague idyllic facade of happiness, numb myself to reality and become a loving Christian husband.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What would that mean though?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is that how other people achieve happiness? By thrusting themselves into the first lie that does indeed make them feel happy?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Am I just some retard romantic who still thinks happiness is achieved through effort? What difference would it make if I put on the honey-goggles? I'd still be happy. Isn't that what matters?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't know.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Maybe I just feel like it'd be selfish. To push Stella away without regard, to allow Fang to live a lobotomized hollow shell of a life just so that we could fool ourselves into being happy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And yet it's so tempting.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">All my problems would just go away, and I'd never have to look back. What's more, if I had a decent life with a happy wife and kids, I'd make my family proud too. What my old man wouldn't give to have his son make it in life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So many reasons why this is the right choice, still, it feels everything but right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't know. I don't know anything.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">This whole soul-searching thing led nowhere.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What conclusion is there to make?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm uncertain about Stella and wish we could fix things. Except I'd need to explain things to her how I want to fake-cheat on her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And why do I want that? Well because I'm either really in love with Fang and it's not even fake cheating, or it's that I want to use someone vulnerable to achieve a selfish goal.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Except that the very reason why I've wanted to talk to Stella was to ask for help how NOT to do that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Nothing makes sense anymore.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I didn't even touch on the subjects of Fang's attempted murder-suicide, or the fact that I'm such a psycho that I almost let her die.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The first waning rays of sunlight penetrate the cracks left around the cardboard, and suddenly I realize it's morning.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel just as tired and pathetic as before.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Guess I'll just soldier through classes and detention, then... Maybe I can try this thing again once I get home.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Is there anyone else I could maybe talk to?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Evidently, Reed would be the first person I'd go to in a situation like this, but that's not an option now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish? No. Not even if I knew how to contact her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rosa? Maybe, but I doubt I'll see her anytime soon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Spears?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well... He did seem to care, and he did try to give me advice earlier, but... I don't feel like whining to him about my insecurities. He's probably busy anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh well, time to start the day I guess.</div>
