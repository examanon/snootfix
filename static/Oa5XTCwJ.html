                    <div class="fanfic-line">Title: Reeda Gots The Hots For Anon</div><div class="fanfic-line">Status: On-Going</div><div class="fanfic-line">Characters: Trish, Reeda</div><div class="fanfic-line">Rating: SFW</div><div class="fanfic-line">Classification: One Shot</div><div class="fanfic-line">Author: Anonymous</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda shifted around in her seat nervously. In her hand was a crumpled up piece of paper, one she's scribbled a very important message inside. She wanted to give this note to a particular classmate of hers. Trish.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It was math class you see, the one Reeda shared with the her tiny triceratops girlfriend. And this thing, well, it was about a boy. That's why she needed advice from another girl. And that's why this had to happen during maths, while Fang was off in Fernsworth's class. It would have been nice to ask Fang, but since they used to be an item with the guy, it would have been totes super-duper awkward.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She didn't like going behind Fang's back doing all this, but what else could she have done? She was damn certain their splitting up had to do with Fang anyway. Hardly could have been the fault of that dreamy, dreamy guy. Fang being who she is, she must have been too aggressive and chased away poor shy Anon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The sound of chalk breaking off on the whiteboard snapped the raptor out of her daydreaming. `Right, this is happening now!` she decided, silently slipping the note to Trish while the teacher still had his back to them. The contents of the note weren't all that conspicuous though. It mostly said that she wanted to talk after class, with Trish, alone. And that it was about a boy, without naming any names.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's been a whole week now since she couldn't work up her courage to bring the topic up with Trish, let alone approach Anon. He was like this delicate flower of a nerd, so Reeda felt like the smallest mistake could doom her attempts at getting closer to him. Despite her popularity among her peers, Reeda's never been good with guys at all. The smoke and mirrors thing she pulled for everyone else was really just a sham. Appearing popular for the sake of appearing popular.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">To be honest she did enjoy dressing all trashy, but it was for herself, not anyone else. Or maybe it was a mix between the two? She honestly felt comfortable in those kind of clothes and the hooker-makeup, and she did feel attractive, but there was something more to it. She liked tricking people into thinking she was this junkie-type dumb bimbo, when in reality she was a straight A student. Blessing of velociraptor genes and all that. Runs in the family.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That must have been why Reeda liked Anon to begin with. He was something more than all the dumb jocks hitting on her in hopes of a quicky, and certainly way more than the obnoxious acne-ridden spergs orbiting her from a distance. Anon was this silent type of guy who seemed totally comfortable in his own little world, but Reeda felt like there was definitely more than meets the eye there. Just like with herself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A nudging came at her elbow, Trish passing her reply back to Reeda. The trike's face was sort of scrunched up in a slight frown, which, while totally not alien to Trish, surprised the raptor girl. She knew Trish was clever when she wanted to be, but could she have figured it all out that easily?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">`Roof PE?` that's all the note said. It probably pertained to how PE classes have practically turned into free periods for both of them, albeit for wildly different reasons. Trish somehow managed to pull a something something ethnic minority card with Spears, and as for Reeda, it was actually a bad case of asthma from all the smoking. Though to her parents, and the faculty, and everyone else, it was just thought of as normal ass asthma. So usually the two of them sat around benched gossiping, watching the boys and spinning fantasies, or watching Fang bulldoze anyone into the ground who felt like crossing her path out in the field. Naomi, mostly.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She gave a quick nod and thumbs-up to Trish, then they both turned their attention back to the lecture.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">- o -</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Later...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So what's this about? A boy? You? It's not that dumb skinnie, is it?" Trish bombarded the poor raptor with questions as soon as they got done double-checking that nobody else was up there with them on the roof.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Come on, Trish! He's not that bad!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I knew it!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reeda didn't like the accusary tone of her friend one bit. Suddenly, she wasn't so sure if asking Trish was the right thing after all, cause she really did have it out for Anon. For some reason.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Ugh, look! This is important to me okay? And like, I need your help."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The two of them have been thick as thieves in the past, so surely Trish would be able to overlook her prejudice for the cause. That's what Reeda thought anyway. But it didn't seem to be happening.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"...You could do so much better. Like, girl, wake up! Why HIM?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Red tint filled the raptor's already red scaly cheeks, her long, feathery tail wrapping up on her leg nervously. Just thinking of Anon made her go week at the knees, having to explain herself felt inexplicably awkward.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"It's... I think he's... Cute...?" she murmured. While that wasn't the whole truth, it wasn't a lie either. She simply didn't know how to put that peculiar butterflies in the stomach feel into words. It just felt right.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Cute?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Lex Luthor we talking about here? The great Baldo Baldiny? Planet of the apes?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's got Reeda there. Anon didn't look bad per se, but cute wasn't actually a term she'd use to describe him. He was just... Normal. And yeah, he wasn't a dino either.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So she just stood there, in awkward silence. Trish continued to eye her for a while, something that to anyone else would have come off as a cold, arrogant, analytic glare of judgment. But Reeda knew the triceratops better than that. She knew gears were turning in that horned head of hers, either to conclude that this is a fool's errand and she won't be a part of it; or, and what Reeda was hoping for, that it might be a fool's errand, but it's the errand of someone important to her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You know Fang won't like this, right? She went down this road already, too." the harsh edge from Trish's voice was gone by then, replaced with a more concerned fashion "I mean, why would you...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hearing Trish change her tone felt incredibly good to Reeda. Despite her protest, she knew her trike friend was just trying to look out for her. And that she has already decided to help her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Trish was right though, again. Things could get complicated fast, dating the ex of one of your best friends.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I know, but..." Reeda sighed "But I really, really, really, really like him."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">What more was there to say? In turn, Trish gave a deep sigh of her own, accepting the situation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright, whatever. So what's you plan?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I don't know?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You d... What?" there was so much surprise in Trish's voice, Reeda hasn't seen her so flabbergasted in quite some time "What do you mean you don't know?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well I just don't! What do you think I should do?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Seriously?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Seriously-seriously!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Another sigh from Trish, accompanied with a very much shaking-her-head-in-disbelief looking gesture. Not only did she disagree with the whole notion of dating Anon in the first place, but she had to spell it out too? An exercise in pain, probably.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Look. Boys are stupid, and you know it. Take him back to your place and that's that."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"My... My place? But how?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">While Reeda still felt unsure about pretty much everything, the pained whine Trish sent to the heavens told a different story. Getting more than a little annoyed toying around with this impostor who seemingly took her ever-confident Reeda's place, the triceratops walked straight up to her, and with a deft motion cupped the raptor's breasts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Geez Trish! What are are you...?" but complain as Reeda might, Trish wouldn't let go of her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"What are these for, sister, huh? Just for show?" Trish yelled in her face while variably pushing those soft boobs together or bouncing them up and down "Put 'em out for that idiot and it's a homerun. You literally can't mess it up."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But I don't even know if he would like my tits!" Reeda argued as she backed away from Trish's grasp, still not convinced "What if he's into flat girls?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Raptor Jesus Christ, Reeda! Do you hear yourself? That weirdo will be astonished a girl sink down to his level for like two words!" by that point veins were popping out Trish's neck and forehead "There's just no way he'll say no! If Fang could do it then so can you. Any more stupid ass questions, or are we done here?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well..."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She wasn't even sure why, yet still, Reeda wanted to disagree. Maybe for fear that after this she won't have an excuse not to talk to Anon? She was afraid to try, because he might say no. But wasn't that just silly, though? Maybe Trish was right. Reeda knew she was a popular girl, perceived as one anyway, so maybe Anon really can't say no to her? Take him back to her place and seal the deal? Doesn't sound that hard, there are like a hundred guys in the school alone who'd kill for the same opportunity.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Although, wouldn't it be better to start with an actual date or something? Maybe not. Plenty of time for all that once they're a couple.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"So I should just bring him back to my room, and...?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Room, bed, floor, couch, kitchen counter, whatever! If you really want that stupid monkey for yourself, then go and get him."</div>
