I'm slowly dragged into consciousness, grumbling in annoyance as I squirm away from the light, burying myself deeper into the covers. Alas, it seems there's no escape, every spot I find harshly illuminated within moments. I roll away from that accursed window, shuffling closer to that familiar weight on the other side of the bed. I can feel the gentle rise of her chest as I drape my arm around her, burying my face in the soft downy feathers of her wings. The soothing sound of her breathing and the chirping of the birds outside are all I need to doze off again, content to sleep the morning away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eventually Fang stirs slightly in my arms, the rhythm of her breaths hitching for a moment. Her legs stretch under the covers as she yawns, her snout snapping shut as she wiggles against me. With a deep contented sigh she leans back into my chest, taking my hand in hers and gently stroking my fingers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mornin' dweeb..." She sleepily yawns again, using her favorite little private pet-name.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Mhrrgh..." I grumble into her wings, her shoulders shaking as Fang chuckles. She continues stroking my hand, her tail squirming as it tries to happily wag beneath the covers. The two of us lay there, gently dozing on and off as the morning sun rises, filling the bedroom with golden light. Warm air blows in from the window, carrying the sound of the neighborhood slowly beginning to wake up. Somewhere in the distance a windchime blows in the breeze, a gentle melody of metallic tones just barely audible on the wind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The cool evening air we enjoyed the night before is slowly pushed out by the bright morning sun, the room gradually growing warmer. Reluctantly, Fang and I separate, shrugging off the thickest of the covers as we gradually wake up. Fang takes the opportunity to roll over and face me, her sleepy amber eyes shining under her tangled bangs. She just smiles at me, no words necessary to convey the feeling of completeness she knows we both share right now. Unable to help myself, I lean over and plant a kiss on the top of her snout. Fang laughs and tries to squirm away from my affections, playfully planting a hand on my chest. "Hey, c'mon. Let me shower first, I'm a mess."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You're beautiful." I retort, tickling her sides as I pepper her face with kisses. Fang eventually pushes herself free, planting a retaliatory kiss on my forehead as we settle down. Our fingers interlock under the sheets as we stare into each other's eyes, unwilling to get up just quite yet. Fang snuggles back into her pillow, her eyelids drooping as she decides to catch just a bit more sleep. I stay with her, content to watch the slow rise and fall of her shoulders, memorizing the peaceful look on her face as she nods off. I pretend not to notice the soft footsteps on the carpet coming from the hallway, until a little weight jump onto the mattress behind me. Fang jolts awake as tiny hands are planted on my shoulder, rocking me back and worth from behind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Daaaaaaad, get up!" A lovely little voice whines from behind me, my chest swelling every time I hear it.  A second pair of amber eyes looks down at me from above, her face silhouetted in a halo of shortly cropped silver hair. She pouts adorably, her indignant expression undercut somewhat by the fluffy pink pajamas she's wearing. She shakes my shoulder again, apparently not convinced I'm quite awake yet.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"C'mon Dad, it's ten in the morning! You promised to make pancakes today!" She pleads, her argument infallible. With an exaggerated groan I roll over, planting my face down into the pillow as Fang laughs at me. Our daughter is undeterred, getting down on all fours to get close to my face. Little does she know, she's fallen right into my trap. My arm springs out like a snake, wrapping around her waist and pulling her close as she squeals in surprise. There's no escape for her as I mercilessly blow raspberries against her neck, her legs kicking against the covers as she laughs in delight. Just when she thinks I've relented, my fingers snake their way into her armpit, her laughter redoubling as I exploit her weakness. I easily hold her tight as she struggles, letting her almost worm free just to pull her back into my grasp. Eventually I let her squirm free, her giggling like music to my ears as she calms down.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Dad, c'mon! It's pancake time!" She repeats, trying to pull the pillow out from under my head. I playfully stay rooted, another pair of hands pushing against my back as Fang betrays me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"C'mon 'Dad', get going. I'm hungry too." Fang snickers, our daughter pulling against my arm with all her might. With a great exaggerated groan I rise up, wiping the crust from my eyes as the light of my life excitedly scrambles off the mattress. I grab my sweatpants from the floor and pull them on as she waits impatiently by the door, clutching her favorite stuffed orca as she bounces from foot to foot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright sweet-pea, I'm coming." I yawn, following her as she rushes toward the kitchen. We pass several framed photos in the hall, all showing treasured memories of the past few years. The reunion at Volcano High, the wedding, Fang smiling against the sunset, and finally the daughter we made together, swaddled in her mother's arms. "Do you want to help me make them?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah!" She beams, giving me the same enthusiastic answer as ever, "With chocolate chips!" Looking down at her, I know that everything was worth it, that everything is going to be alright. No matter what happens, I will never regret the path I took to get here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Well of course." I smile, all my worries long since forgotten as I watch her run, "You can't have pancakes without chocolate chips."</div>
