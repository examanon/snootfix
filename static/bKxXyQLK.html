We gotta try all the rides!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Once Tana learned that I was just as new to this as she was the two of us became best friends</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Much to the chagrin of her older sister</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Lighten up, Trish. We're supposed to be having fun!" I call back to her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Don't push your luck skinnie. I'm here to babysit one little girl, not two!" She shouts over the crowd</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Good thing I'm here to have fun rather than argue with her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>First stop is some kind of whirlygig</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As the three of us approach the machine, Tana is practically bouncing up and down</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'm a little excited myself, this looks neat</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish blanches however</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"We're skipping this one, I don't want to lose my lunch"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tana looks positively heartbroken</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"But you promised we'd do all the rides!" She pouts</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish definitely looked guilty but I could tell she was resolute in her decision, fortunately, I knew just what to do</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Leaning down for Tana, I whispered conspiratory words in her ears</div><div class="fanfic-line">>My partner in crime giggled but nodded along</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I crooked my arms into wings and bent over</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"What are you, a prehistoric chicken?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah! Bawk bawk!" Tana added eagerly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish seemed baffled at first but as soon as I saw her nostrils flare I knew we had her hook line and sinker</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Fine! Lets do the stupid thing!" she shouted, tugging me along</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With the three of us aboard the rotor-ride it finally began</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Being nailed to the wall by cetrifuge was certainly unique</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tana was absolutely loving it, cheering all the while</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish even kept her lunch down!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>In fact, when we got off. I saw her smiling</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As soon as she noticed me the smile disappeared</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But we both knew</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now that Trish slipped up, it was my mission to get her to smile again</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It had become something of a game between the two of us since I came to Volcano High</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Reed and I usually spent a lot of math class chatting</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Mostly because Reed was some kind of savant when it came to math</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I was telling some joke that I read on an mongolian basket weaving forum</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Except instead of Reed laughing, it was Trish</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I didn't even know Trish bothered listening to us, she always seemed to be more foused on her earphones</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The best part is, she snorts when she laughs</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It's kind of cute</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Of course, she went right back to being a cunty ceratops soon after</div><div class="fanfic-line">>My second success came when Reed was sick for a whole week</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The guy was smart but it's easy to dose a little to hard on carfe</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I still kinda wanted to try it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Without Reed there to bail either of us out we actually had to work together</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Too bad neither of us were any good at math</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Apparently my taste in music is hilarious because both Trish and Fang laughed when I told them</div><div class="fanfic-line">>They just couldn't truly appreciate videogame OST's</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The casuals</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I feel a tugging on my sleeve</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tana is pointing at the only tent in the place that wasn't brightly colored</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A sign out front reads "Allow the mistress of the stars to point your way!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"I bet she's gonna be a really cool witch!" Tana turned to me for approval</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"With a really big hat" I nodded sagely</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish looked between the two of us, skeptical</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Do we really need to stop here, too? We could get this just for free just talking to-"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Stella!?" I shout over her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The lime green stegosaur seemed just as surprised to see us walk into her parlor as we were to see her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was dressed in elegant purple robes, her ubiquitous space buns lost beneath an equally purple bandanna</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella recovered quickly once she saw Tana, a hand moving to her crystal ball</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"So you wish to divine meaning in the tenebrous paths that alter fate? Allow me to be your guide"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tana was immediately hooked</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish and I shared a glance, my amusment to her disbelief</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella performed her song and dance, enrapturing the young girl who waited for the conclusion with bated breath</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The grand reveal was that the futures divined were merely opportunities. For a life so young had too many paths to take</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I'm not sure why it took 15 minutes of drama to tell her something so obvious but I guess it was all part of the show</div><div class="fanfic-line">>based on the wide, hopeful smile that Tana wore I guess she enjoyed it</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Now, for you two I'll need to produce my most powerful tool" Stella intoned, sliding a tarot deck from her sleeve</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"The winds of fate are strong in your presence, with but a single card I'm all but certain your future shall be revealed!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish rolled her eyes</div><div class="fanfic-line">>this was a little hammy even for me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Stella paid no mind however, with a flourish she slid the card from it's home and dramatically slapped it faceside up on the table</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A grinning skeleton stared up at me above the flowery script of 'death'</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I could feel my eyebrow raise unbidden "Alright, guess I'm not going on the coaster tonight"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"The death card doesn't have anything to do with death" Trish replied after a groan</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"She is correct, the upright death symbolizes change and new beginnings. It is no wonder the cosmic forces are strong with you tonight. Make the most of them" Stella agreed with a nod</div><div class="fanfic-line">>With those ominous words the stego-seer let us go</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She's a sweet girl, even if she is a little weird</div><div class="fanfic-line">>speaking of weird</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Since when did you know tarot, Trish?" I ask casually while Tana is distracted by what to do next</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish briefly flickered between being embarrassed and angry</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"None of your damn business, skinnie" she growled, practically daring me to ask again</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Trish used to be a witch too!" Tana chirped, utterly unaware of the tone of the conversation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I couldn't help it, I laughed. Trish was into this stuff? Really!?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Not. Another. Word." Trish hissed, poking my chest for emphasis</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I zip my lips with my finger, though my smile probably diminished the effect</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tana took us along a few more rides, even a carousel</div><div class="fanfic-line">>guess she was still a little girl after all</div><div class="fanfic-line">>even despite all the fun I couldn't push the image of Trish playing with tarot cards or concocting spells</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I think Trish knew, mostly because I started cracking up whenever I looked at her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Picturing her in some kind of wiccan outfit, it was hard not too</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Im hungry..." Tana moaned, hand on her stomach</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Come to think of it, so was I. We had been here a while</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"We can get some food around here, right?" I ask, looking at Trish for confirmation</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Yeah, yeah. Come on you brats, I know just the thing"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was laying it on a little thick now</div><div class="fanfic-line">>If only she knew how embarrassing my past was</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That thought stuck with me for a bit, Trish and I have always had friction</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And I didn't even know why, we were all friends now weren't we?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I was literally at a carnival with her and her sister</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Maybe a little bit of trust could go a long way? One secret for another?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish led the way to a food stand</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The smell was utterly heavenly</div><div class="fanfic-line">>wait, you can deep fry oreo's? No fucking way</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This food was unreal, I didn't even know it could taste this good!</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Through tears of Joy I could see Tana was having a similar experience</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish was just shaking her head at me, a cone of cotton candy in her hand</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Carnival food really was everything it was talked up to be</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All good things must come to an end however, the hour was getting late and our bellies were filled</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As if sensing the mood Tana spoke up</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"One last ride before we go home! C'mon!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A leviathan of glowing lights and metal loomed high in the sky</div><div class="fanfic-line">>There was one thing that no carnival trip was complete without</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"How about the Ferris wheel?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>All three of us approached the great beast, the siren call of any true carnival</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As we stepped aboard our trio was squeezed into a single cart</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tana ended up squished between Trish and I</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She was smiling but no longer hopping up and down like she did earlier</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Guess she finally burned through all that energy</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Or maybe it was the itis, I was starting to feel it too</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Finally, the carts began to move and we were lifted into the sky</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Volcadera bluff truly was beautiful</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Did you have fun tonight, Tana?" I asked,  my attention still on the golden lights of the city below</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When I didn't receive a response I looked down to see the girl fast asleep, lulled by the gentle rumble and rocking of our carriage</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"It wasn't so terrible I guess" Trish spoke up in her place</div><div class="fanfic-line">>We shared a few quiet moments</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You'd make a pretty good dad, skinnie. I'm surprised" Trish's hushed words broke the silence</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I wasnt sure how to respond to that</div><div class="fanfic-line">>That was the closest thing to an olive branch Trish ever gave me</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Guess it was time to return the favor</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Look, you dont need to be embarrassed about the whole witch thing. I used to run around with a plastic sword in my teeth, I've got you beat"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>When I heard her snort devolve into laughter proper I was glad it was dark enough that she couldn't see my cheeks burn</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I gripped the railing of our cart, trying my best to ignore her</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her laughter subsided quicker than I expected, I was still far too embarrassed to look back to her though</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A warm hand suddenly joined mine on the railing</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I turned to Trish, her amethyst eyes twinkled like the stars in the night sky we were held aloft in</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"You're a dork" She said, her attention shifting to those same stars</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"But I guess I should accept you're our dork now."</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tana snored loudly, interrupting our moment</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish and I shared a laugh, something we hadn't done in a long time</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Thanks for tonight, Trish"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>"Not another word, Anon"</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I merely answered her with a smile</div><div class="fanfic-line">>A smile that she mirrored</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Mission accomplished</div>
