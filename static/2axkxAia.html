I thought you hated me! I’m in love with Fang! I thought she was your friend?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He rattles off other such nonsense to her, as if HE wasn’t the one that seduced HER</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not quite where she expected this to go, but she had a backup plan.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish kicks off the ground toward Anon, causing him to tumble again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This time Trish immediately gets to work.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Removing his pants was child’s play and she could already see the outline of his dick in his underwear.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anticipation causes her to drool as it already looks bigger than she imagined.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“T-Tri-” Trish cuts Anon off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Ah, shut the fuck up skinnie, this already looks worse for you than it does for me. Now if you cooperate, no one has to know. Especially Fang.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tears were forming in Anon’s eyes, he didn’t know what to do.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The little trigger didn’t care anymore, she was lost in her lust.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She pulls down his boxer briefs to reveal his flaccid member, it was definitely much bigger than she imagined.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Not wanting to waste anymore time she takes it into her mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She places her hands on his testes and gently caresses them as she works the shaft.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As she pulls her head toward the top she stops at his glans and runs her tongue around it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon involuntarily bucks into her mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She smiled as best as she could with a cock in her mouth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She had no practical experience, but all of her research was paying off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He was hard and that meant that he was ready.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She gets up and removes her panties and leggings, her thighs already soaked in her own juices.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Trish,” Anon pleads. “We can stop here, we can can forget all of this, everything can go back to the way they were!”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Hmm,” Trish places a finger on her chin, playing as if she was thinking about it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But she had no such thoughts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish drops her hips on Anon’s and is rewarded with the most mind-blowing orgasm of her life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She had never felt fulfillment on this level.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her legs quiver as she attempts to lift herself, but in the moment they were too weak and she crashes back down on her unrequited lover.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon couldn’t help his own instincts as his hips rise to meet hers.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her folds were too welcoming to resist almost as if they had been prepared specifically for him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Between her falling and his rising, they eventually create a rhythm.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The sounds of their lust were muffled within the room as the foam pads absorb the vibrations.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon could feel Trish orgasm continuously as her pussy gave him the dino grip over and over again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He didn’t want to admit it, but Anon couldn’t help feeling proud of himself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The purple trigger that he thought hated him was now riding him as if her life depended on it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>And she loved it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish almost couldn’t believe that she had finally done it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Ever since she saw this idiotic monkey walk up the stairs to Volcano High, she knew she had to have him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But her best friend reached him first.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang probably would have shared him with me if I asked, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You know, part of me thought you two would just hatefuck and be done with it," Trish imagined.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Yeah, she wasn’t going behind her friend’s back, this what she would’ve wanted anyway, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Besides, he was walking around doing all of those things to impress her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Like, hanging around, and eating food, and being sweaty, and...shit.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Is this what guys call post nut clarity?</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Tri-Trish, I’m gonna...” Trish was shaken from her thoughts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Oh fuck, he’s going to cum.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Before her body could respond to her thoughts she was struck by another orgasm.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Curse their innate compatibility.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish feels Anon’s warmth enter her body as he lets out thick spurts of ejaculate within her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This was a unexpectedly pleasant feeling.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Her hands stroke her belly where she can feel Anon inside her, following the trail from her pubic region to her navel.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Fuck Anon, I didn’t think you would last that long.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish tried to play it cool, but the guilt was already wriggling within her mind.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She raped her best friend’s boyfriend and had him cum inside her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Even if that last part was an accident, it was all her fault.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon was very distressed, Trish could see that.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He was crying and babbling, bringing up Fang, and pregnancy, and the chances of being discovered.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Did this count as cheating for him?</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No. She forced him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She couldn’t just... undo what she just did, but she could maybe assuage his fears?</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon, Anon, Anon, I’m on the pill, don’t worry about me getting pregnant.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He managed to quiet his crying to a whimper.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“As for Fang, I’ll take the blame and tell her it was estrus.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Technically it was, even if it was out of season.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Let’s get cleaned up. I have some wipes and stuff in my backpack.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish gets up and puts her panties and leggings back on, she had spares in her bag, but she definitely didn’t want to make a bigger mess in the booth.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon was quick to get up and put his underwear and pants on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish still managed to get one last good look at his dick though.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>It’s definitely the last time she’ll see it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish produces some single use cleaning wipes from her bag, and hands some to Anon.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Go get yourself cleaned up in the bathroom, I’ll take care of this room.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon, wordlessly nods his head and runs off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He was adorable sometimes, like a big dumb dog.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She then pulls out some carpet cleaner and air freshener, she needed to remove the stench of sex before Fang and Reed showed up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Trish props open the booth door to let the room air out, and hopefully eliminate as much of the smell as she can.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Pretty soon Anon comes back, a little frightened, but at least he was still here.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>She gets close to him and straightens up his clothes and does a smell check.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>He definitely still smelled of their one-time tryst, but hopefully it’ll clear up, or the others won’t notice.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Anon, I’m sorry,” Trish starts.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>How the fuck do you rape someone and then say sorry?</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I wasn’t in my right head space, estrus will do that kind of thing to you, y’know?”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Of course he didn’t, humans don’t experience estrus.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I got it into my mind that you were seducing me and I couldn’t stop thinking about you.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>These are just excuses at this point.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I’ve done something unforgivable...again. This time I doubt you’ll ever give me another chance.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Tears start welling up in Trish’s eyes, she knew what came over her, but she didn’t even think to stop it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Heavy sobs escape from her, she had feelings for Anon, but she loved Fang too, they were practically sisters.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Now she was full-blown ugly crying, unable to stem the flow of emotions escaping from her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But then, something unexpected occurred.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon, was giving her a hug?</div><div class="fanfic-line">“I don’t know a whole lot about estrus and stuff, but…”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Was he consoling her?</div><div class="fanfic-line">“But, I heard it can be pretty rough if you don’t handle it properly.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>No way.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Honestly, I don’t really want to think about what happened anymore. So let’s just forget the whole thing.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">>This definitely wasn’t the healthiest way of dealing with this, but Anon was the victim, so she’ll just go with whatever he says.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Now, you need to get yourself cleaned up.”</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">>The whole affair took less than 30 minutes, so Anon and Trish had a bit of time to make sure everything was spotless and ready to go when the other two finally showed up.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Anon rushed to meet his girlfriend and help her with her equipment, while Trish helped with Reed’s.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After the setup, Anon wanted to use his limited experience to assist the producer as best he could.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>But the producer wasn’t interested.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>VVURM DRAMA managed to bang out recordings of two of their most well received songs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>After the session, they still had a few moments before their scheduled time was up, and so Reed called a band meeting. Leaving Anon out again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Sorry bro, but this is just between us,” Reed tried to make it less personal, but…</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Is it me or does Anon-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Stink?” Fang cuts him off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yeah, he almost smells like-”</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Stop right there, Reed, I don’t want to hear it.” Fang pinches the bridge of her snout.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>As much as she loved the idiot, Anon could be so clueless sometimes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>Fang glances at Trish who was now beet red, Fang guessed that Trish didn’t want to embarrass her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">“It’s okay you two, I’ll…talk to him about it. Hopefully it won’t happen again.”</div>
