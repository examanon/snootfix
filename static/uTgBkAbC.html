Anon mutters to himself “Time for another day of school, shitposting, and playing the vidya.” as he carries himself out of bed.  Anon proceeds to pour himself a bowl.  “I guess I’ve only got Chocolate Helicopter, not the best cereal but it’ll do.” He thought to himself.  After pouring a bowl, Anon proceeds to browse a Belarusian gardening forum to bait unsuspecting posters.  While browsing the forum he gets bored and decides to go and bait people on an Iranian creepypasta forum.  While looking at the particular board he comes across a post in the most atrociously butchered English he’d ever seen before.  “Sorri for bat englis. today am dead rise form grav. i notic tat in my vilag tat evryon get sik nd di. excep thei don di ”.  Anon was about to reply saying that OP is a faggot and move on until he sees a photo of a group of what looked like to be a single shambler type snacking on a corpse, the thread gets 404’d before he could post.  Anon thinks to himself “God damn jannies, they do it for free”.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After this he grabs his backpack and heads to school as normal.  While walking too school he notices a pale Allosaur with a goatee and a pony tail not older than his late twenties or early thirties stumbling around.  Judging from his outfit, it looked like he worked in IT.  He thought to himself that “It look like he caught that bug that’s going around” and simply continued to walk to school ignoring him and thinking nothing of it.  He finally gets to Volcano High where Anon begins his day as normal.  Second class, literature with Mr. Wells.  Nothing eventful happens other than Anon overhearing some students talking about people dropping dead and reanimating.  Third Period is Gym class with…  Well, nobody knows his real name, everyone just calls him Coach.  A cyan blue triceratops in his Early 40s who’s the school’s Football coach.  Today Anon and the class were going to do track.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Eh, not the worst exercise in the world.” Anon would say to himself in his mind.  He’d proceed to jog alone as there weren’t that many people he knew in Gym Class.  In the middle of a jog he’d pull out his phone to check on a website dedicated to talking about Filipino TV Shows.  One of the threads of course would be about a weird flu that was going around since he remembered the thread getting 404’d which activated his almonds.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The thread was about the same topic but this time it actually had proper English this time.  The OP posted as following with a picture of the scene around a few minutes after the incident.</div><div class="fanfic-line">>driving to work a few hours ago</div><div class="fanfic-line">>rabid looking man runs out into the middle of the road</div><div class="fanfic-line">>I accidentally hit the mother fucker</div><div class="fanfic-line">>call an ambulance</div><div class="fanfic-line">>EMT on the scene</div><div class="fanfic-line">>the mother fucker tears into the jugular of the EMT</div><div class="fanfic-line">>book it the fuck out of there</div><div class="fanfic-line">What the fuck did I just witness</div><div class="fanfic-line">Anon decided to reverse search the image on Snootgle in the case it was fake.  Anon is bewildered when zero results pop up on Snootgle with the exception of the thread.  It’s at this point Anon starts to get a slight bit worried.  All the sudden Reed pulls up beside Anon and shouted to him.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">“Yooo Anon, what’s goin’ on maaan…”</div>
