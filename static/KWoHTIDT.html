She then finds out hentai logic doesn't apply to real life.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Come on Stella, you can do it! You're a big girl now.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Eighteen, that's practically an adult, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">You'll be like the grownups and handle estrus season without any embarrassing incidents this time!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">These are the thoughts I muse myself with as I struggle to keep hold of my pen. My hand is very, very eager to explore a certain aching spot between my legs.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take a deep breath to steel myself, fighting the carnal urges.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The plan is simple. Write a list of everyone I should avoid, and them avoid them. Only for a few weeks.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Should be easy-peasy, though the burning feeling within my body warns otherwise.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh gosh, this is the absolute worst!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I want to scream and shout, anything to make the heat go away.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ugh, concentrate! Just write the list, baka! Then you can take a nice, long shower. Yeah, just set the head to pulsate and...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I forcibly set my attention back to the task at hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Hokai. Let's do this!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Without heeding much notice to the shame of having talked to so few guys that I can probably name them all, I start racking my brain on the matter.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Okay. Prom. Chadshark.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He wasn't that bad to hang with, so that's a no-no.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Who's next?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Reed.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ugh, Reed? Seriously?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Yeah okay, I can see that happen. He's kinda muscular, plus that tank top is hot.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Uhhhh...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh right, those two guys from the club!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then uhhh...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I shuffle around in my seat, unable to find a comfortable position.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Damn, I'm so fucking wet already, this is a nightmare. I know that the first few days are the worst of it, but that doesn't really help my situation any. Damn dino genes.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh, that reminds me! Anon!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...even though he's a skinnie? Plus he's got Fang.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I find myself biting my lip. Intersex isn't unheard of. He's cute too, when he's not being an asshole for no reason.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Mhmm, I'd totally blow him even if he's an asshole.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Woah, where did that come from? Come on girl, you can't just... Like...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">However much my mind shouts no, I can't stop nibbling on the pen. Fuck, I fucking want Anon to dominate me now!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ooooohhhh...!!!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't stop my imagination.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Asshole Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"On your knees bitch. And open wide."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I obey, of course, awaiting my due punishment.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">He's so strong and manly!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Come on Anon, give me that big meaty HUMAN COCK!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Asshole Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"ITADAKIMASU STERRA CHAN"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Asshole Anon]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Also, your waifu a shit."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Chuckling, I get back to the present.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Where was I?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ugh, the list. Great, now it has drool on it.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Well, five names is plenty. Time for that shower.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">One shameful shower and restless night later, it's time for school. I've even put my usual stream watching session aside in an attempt to cool my head. Although looking back now, I probably could have used the distraction.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Whatevs, I'm just being a silly-cat like always.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I put on my most plain clothes in hopes of avoiding the guys' attention. Not that I get much anyway.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">A baggy shirt and cargo shorts. Would've preferred something that covers my legs, but all I have are sticky jeans. Defo don't want boys to check out my cute butt!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">After that I make my way to the kitchen, gulping down my bowl of colorful cereal that Daddy has prepared for me. He's probably already off to work, same as Mommy.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">That saddens me a bit, but at least now I have some time to figure out a plan for today. There should be a special estrus education thingy spanning the first few periods. They do one each semester.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">If I don't see Rosa there I'll just find her later. She's super strict about boys, so I know she'll keep me in check too.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I mean, not like she'll have to. Just uhh, on the off-chance, right?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Gosh, how does she even do that? Despite my most sincere efforts, I still couldn't push the thought of sucking off Anon out of my head.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In my desperation, I flick on the TV and search for some morning cartoons. If I'm lucky, I can catch the DBZ rerun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Seems I'm not lucky.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look around the room, frustrated. There must be something to get my mind off of boys.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I entertain the idea of a speedy tarot reading, but quickly dismiss it. I know myself too well to know that right now I'm predisposed to looking for arcana related to sex. Even if Gaia herself talked through my hand, I'd fail to give real meaning to even a half-spread.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Mmmmmaybe another shower? That should help get the edge off.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I feel a little ashamed, knowing that it isn't the getting clean part that motivates me. Still, what could it hurt?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">* * *</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I arrive a few minutes before the start, having enjoyed the shower a little too much.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But! I did come twice, and only thought of Anon a little.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Okay, a lot. Gosh, I don't even know where these thoughts are coming from! I'm sure that I don't like him that much!</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Ugh...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Thankfully, Rosa saved a seat for me at the end of the first row.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Rosa]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hey, Stella! You're running a bit late. Is everything okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Looking at Rosa alone, one definitely could not tell that estrus season has begun. She looks like she always does.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Yeah, sorry."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I take my place next to her and we make some smalltalk.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She also informs me that there's going to be an impromptu club meeting this afternoon, which is weird cause we rarely have those, and never on a Monday.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Plus only the two of us can call for a meeting, so Rosa definitely has something planned. Double weird that she's not told me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Before I could ask, the head nurse appears at the teacher's desk. She's another stego like me, so I've always found her relatable. I've only met her a couple of times, but she's always been nice to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Today in place of her usual nurse robes she's donned a more professional looking attire, some variation of a business suit. It definitely compliments her curvy body and raven-like facial features.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I guess she deals with estrus in a different manner than I intend to.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In examination, I notice that her shirt isn't buttoned up all the way. In fact if I look behind the long tie, I can practically see the top brim of her lacey bra.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Oh gosh, should I tell her? Um... This is so awkward.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She plugs her laptop into the projector that's already been set up, and greets us in an overly cheerful manner.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Hello there, girls! This heat, huh?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She does a very animated fanning motion, causing a few girls to giggle.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm lost focusing on her jiggly breasts. Is this what boys do too?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The slideshow eventually starts, and I can finally distract myself.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"You probably all know why we're here today. The estrous cycle. Rut. Heat. Breeze. Whatever you wanna call it."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"We'll cover the topic in a series of small talks. What's happening, WHY is it happening, why you should be careful, and finally how to be careful."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Aww shucks, I was a teen once too you know, so I won't be all like, NO BOYS!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She gives the audience a wink with a sly grin.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But don't you tell Spears about that, okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She's rewarded with a few laughs and nods. While her smile remains, she continues in a more serious tone.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"I'm sure that you've all heard most of what I'm about to tell you, but it is still my responsibility to make sure you can make educated choices and don't give in to rumors and misconceptions."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Alright, before I bore you all to death, here's the real important part. If you think you're making the right choice and... Love a boy... Be smart about it!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She produces a small box from inside her jacket, and hands it to the girl on the opposite end of the first row. Poor girl's face goes up in flames as the box is revealed to be a pack of condoms.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Wow.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Take a look, then pass it forward. It's my favorite brand."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">The nurse continues unabated, that coy smile returning to her lips.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"But that's a secret too, okay?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Again, wow. That's definitely not how I got to know her. She's always used to be so mild mannered! In the past years, she's just skipped through the slideshow, giving us the rest of the day off. What happened?</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look back at the girl she gave the box to, and note that she's already passed it to the student sitting behind her.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I can't deny that it's perplexing. I'm actually excited, awaiting the pack to get to me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Next to me, Rosa mumbles something under her breath, and I can see her clutching onto her crucifix.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Right, maybe not everyone is as excited as I am.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I divert my attention back to the presentation.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">We go through the usual biology textbook snippets detailing estrus, ovulation, gestation, and so on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Then we get onto hormones and pheromones, and finally onto prevention and protection.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Around that time the pack gets to me from the girl behind me. I would have taken a look at it when Rosa got it, be she passed it on without even a glance. Some resolve she has.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">It's an 8-pack of barbed Magnum Dongs. I don't really get what the barbs are for, but the pack claims that it's for "her pleasure". That causes my face to go bright red, and I decide to pass the thing on.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Except I'm the last in line. I don't want to return it in the middle of the presentation either, so I decide to hold onto it till the end.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Said end comes not long after. There is one new slide that I don't remember from previous years, a chart of some sort.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There are a few kinds of dinos at the top, then humans, and then a various list of animals. It has no metric, just a slider going from green to red.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Okay, I've given you the important bit at the start so now that we're wrapping it up, have some more wisdom!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She chuckles at her own pun.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Like I said, I won't tell you not to find a partner. The point of this whole presentation was so you can choose the right one. So, for your consideration!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Male dinos depending on the kind go about it for five to ten minutes. Humans, also depending, can be around the same, but average a good half hour to an hour. Pigs? Several hours. Ducks? Not even if you die."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">With that, she shuts the projector off and thanks us for the attention.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Several students immediately make a beeline for the exit, the rest get up slowly and stretch. It has been a few hours afterall.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I've never really considered that different species have sex differently. I mean, for such varying amounts of time.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">And humans...? Huh.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Immediately my mind wanders to Anon and my fantasies.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I look down at the pack of condoms in my hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So... If it's not a bad thing to find a mate... If I only need to be smart about it...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">But...</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">In any case, I still have to give this stupid thing back to the nurse before she leaves.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">There are a few girls waiting to talk to her, so I get in line, motioning for Rosa that she can leave if she wants.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She still seems mad about the whole ordeal. Maybe she's not okay with the whole sex-ed in school thing? I've never really noticed it in the past.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">Minutes pass and the line eventually dwindles down to just me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"And what can I help you with, little Stella?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I blush at the nickname. It's what she usually calls me.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Stella]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Just giving this back."</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I try handing her the box, but in response she just giggles, amused.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Oh, you can keep that. I don't think a smart girl like you will do anything stupid, but it's better to have it, right?"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I don't know what to say to that. My awkward expression probably says it all.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">[Nurse]</div><div class="fanfic-line">"Say hi to Rosa for me, okay? Have a nice day!"</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">She leaves abruptly, but with a wink. Just before the door closes I catch a glimpse of some human guy in a suit, waiting for the nurse.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">So that's why she was dressed like that. The implications, cause me to blush hard once again.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">As the room quiets down it dawns on me that I'm in the middle of the school, brandishing a pack of condoms in my hand.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">OH GOSH</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I hastily sink the damn thing into one of my pockets, and rush outside.</div><div class="fanfic-line">​</div><div class="fanfic-line">I'm barely through the doorframe as I bump into none other than the bane of my existence lately, Anon.</div>
