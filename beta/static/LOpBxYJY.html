                    <p>Title: Proto-Doomer Anon</p><p>Status: Incomplete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Trish, Reed, Naomi</p><p>Rating: SFW </p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>>Friday evening.</p><p>>Skin Row.</p><p>>Making my way through the rundown shacks to the one I have been calling home for the last couple of months.</p><p>>That would be somewhat depressing normally, but today I've got myself a little something to make it all better.</p><p>>Something that will go nicely with a half-finished bottle of Pepsi Max.</p><p>>Well, a half-finished bottle of sweet, Pepsi Max-flavored water I accidentally have let decarbonate overnight.</p><p>>Yeah, if there's any silver lining to living in the shithole like this, it would be how laughably easy an underage can buy some cheap shitty whiskey around here.</p><p>>Emphasis on "cheap", even 0,7 L of bootleg alcohol probably shouldn't cost a week's worth of highscooler allowance.</p><p>>Oh well, you get what you pay for. What's the fun in getting fucked up on something that's not 30% cologne, anyway?</p><p>>Getting closer to the porch, I notice a group of familiarly seizure-inducing baseball team mascots.</p><p>>Trish, Reed, Naomi, Naser and, of course, her were actively discussing something right in front of my home right until I showed up.</p><p>>Now, they're all just looking at me.</p><p>>Me and a bottle of liver cirrhosis I've had in my hand. Probably should've put it in a plastic bag or something.</p><p>>Guess it's up to me to break the silence this time.</p><p>Anon: "Uh... Busted?"</p><p>>Smooth.</p><p>>I would've probably cringe'd my colon out if I still had a care about not dropping pasta in front of anyone from that goddamn school.</p><p>Naomi: "No-no-no, do not worry Anon. Neither Principal •Spears nor anyone else from Volcano High will know about this, I promise."</p><p>>Oh goody, the worst possible scenario averted. Now all that's left is to deal with the runner-up that's right in front of me.</p><p>>Wait, did I just took her word on faith?</p><p>>...</p><p>>Whatever. It doesn't matter.</p><p>Anon: "So. what's with a social call, then?"</p><p>Naser: "This... Is not a social call."</p><p>Anon: "Good, 'cause I'm not sharing."</p><p>>After passing through the crowd and making sure not to lock eyes with her, I open the main door and, before I can slip back into the safety of my sanctum, get stopped by a suprisingly muscular pink hand.</p><p>Reed: "Dude, we need to talk. Let us in."</p><p>Anon: "And what would the subject be, I wonder?"</p><p>>C'mon, surprise me. Couldn't possibly be the world's single most "not the only person".</p><p>Trish: "It's... us, Anon. The way we've been treating each other."</p><p>Anon: "...Goaded them into the group session, huh Fang?"</p><p>>The last unwelcome guest can only shuffle around behind my back to confirm that the words have reached her.</p><p>>Good. Do not say anything.</p><p>>Do not make me look at you. Do not look at me.</p><p>>Do not allow eye contact.</p><p>>I carefully consider my options.</p><p>**Let them in**</p><p>**Tell them to fuck off**</p><p>>**Let them in**</p><p>>Better rip the band-aid, Raptor Jesus knows they're gonna make a scene at school later I won't deal with this shit right here and now.</p><p>Anon: "Ok, fine, come in. Again, I'm not sharing, so the best you can hope for is some tea."</p><p>>I open the door and the Sour Patch Crew one by one.</p><p>>...Maybe it's good that they showed up all together like that.</p><p>>It was a long time coming anyway.</p>
