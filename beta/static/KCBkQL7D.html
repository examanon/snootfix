Of course. Of course it had to be him. Anon looked up from his menu at the triceratops, who was dressed in a tight fitting green apron. This year’s Estrus week had been particularly rough, and her coworkers had been particularly irritating today. Of course Anon had to be here. Trish’s teeth – as well as her thighs – grinded together ever so slightly. “What the fuck do you want, skinny?” She growled at him. Anon seemed amused. “Aren’t you going to greet me, Trish?” He asked innocently. “The day I greet you is the day Hell freezes over. Just fucking order already.” Trish’s hands tightened around the paper pad in her hand, leaving a few indents in the paper and cardboard backing. Anon tapped his fingers against the table, face looking smug. Trish fidgeted, trying not to let her rage boil over. After a minute she sighed, eyes screwing shut for a moment before opening back up. She plastered a fake smile and honeyed her words as best she could. “Welcome to Dinobucks! May I please take your order?” She fluttered her eyelashes at Anon, leaning forward and cocking her hips to the side. Kill me now, she thought.</p><p>​</p><p>      Thankfully, Raptor Jesus smiled on her today. Anon quickly browsed the menu, eyes scanning over the various permutations of coffee and flavoring. He was shocked by all the different and overly-complex ways one could have their ‘cup of joe’ turned into a work of edible artistry. Trish’s eyes wandered across him as she waited for him to order. A few agonizing minutes later he finally gave his order, and Trish was able to jot it down onto the ruined paper and leave. As she started to process the order, she found herself grinding her hips against the counter surreptitiously. Unnoticeable to anyone unless they know what they were looking for. The counter gave no relief to the heat that was rising between her legs. Her teeth found the wall of her cheek and bit down hard, the sharp pain helping her focus on the task at hand.</p><p>      Trish fitted the plastic lid to the clear plastic cup, fiddling with it a few times before it finally sealed properly. Stupid piece of shit. Why did they make those things so hard to put on? She wrote Anon’s name in black sharpie on the side, purposely spelling it wrong to spite him. Pushing past the counter, cup in hand, she made her way to the sitting human. Had he been watching her the whole time? Trish’s heart fluttered and warmth came to her cheeks. No, he probably just looked over here a minute ago. Trish presented the cup of frozen coffee crap, silently praying that Anon would just take it and leave. “Oh, I almost forgot.” At this Trish grimaced, her fingers tightening around the fragile cup. “What?” She almost spat. “Could I get that with breast milk?” Anon snickered, his laughter almost mangling his words.</p><p>      Trish’s heart stopped, skipping a beat or two. Did…. Did he just….? The heat was unbearable. Trish’s head filled with thoughts of the rather inappropriate kind. Tossing the cup aside and kissing the human, shoving her tongue down his throat and straddling him like humans did horses. Or maybe he would stand up and kiss her, shoving his hand behind her apron and taking a few handfuls of flesh. No, no, she could see it. He’d bend her over the counter and take her, like the caveman he is. Raw and bestial, hot breath in her ear, as his iron-strength arms held her securely in place. She’d struggle a bit but she’d collapse in a quivering heap as he- “Trish?” Anon asked, a little concerned. The interruption snapped her back to the waking world. Her fingers tightened, breaking the tentative seal on the cup and spilling the sticky bothersome liquid everywhichway. Her mouth spilled into a snarl, her teeth bearing. Her body shook with rage. Anon noticed the sudden change and closed his mouth. “Get out.” Trish hissed. Anon decided it would be a better idea to try the coffee shop down the road. </p></div>
