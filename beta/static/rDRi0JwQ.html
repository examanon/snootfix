For once, at least, Anon was tasked with cleaning up the interior of the school, rather than being saddled with garden duty under the supervision of Ficus Castro. As he made his way through the baren and silent gymnasium he remembered how easy he’d have it this week. All he had to do was mop down the floors and scrub the lockers and showers of the men’s locker room; quick and easy stuff. Could be worse, he could be cleaning down the hallways, the cafeteria, or Professor Fernsworth’s class after lab day. </p><p>Arriving at the metal double doors that would be his cell for the next hour he went ahead and double checked the supplies he had brought: a mop, bucket with water and cleaning solution, some sponges, and a phone to watch Saturnia on, all set. Anon pushed on in with his arsenal and sat it down near the center of the room. Lockers lined the walls on two sides, one wall having a lineup of showers, and the other the doors that led out to the side of the school allowing easy access to the fields. The floor in the center was emblazoned with the school’s logo: a bright orange meteor with a dark black outline. </p><p>“Always thought it was funny a school of dinosaurs decided on a meteor as a symbol of pride.” </p><p>“It’s a pretty cool symbol though, gotta admit that bro.” </p><p>Anon flicked himself over to face the voice whilst equally doing his best to hold back a girly screech. There in the corner by some of the lockers stood Reed, Anon’s ‘first friend’, school drug kingpin, Xrox enthusiast. Albeit, there was something way different about Reed today. The red-haired pink raptor was done up top to bottom in one of the school’s cheerleading outfits... one of the girl’s ones. Up top was a bright orange crop top featuring a black trim around the edges and encircling the orange meteor logo on the chest. That top was hugging his body a bit too well, doing well to show off the trim and toned physique of the raptor that seemed to have an unhealthily low amount of body fat. Tracing down from there led to a rather large and frilly skirt, equally matching the school’s color scheme by alternating the orange and black in vertical stripes. The thick band atop it clung tightly around Reed’s slim waistline, from there tapering off into the frills instead of outlining the rest of his figure. Between that top and bottom, however, was a gap in the attire that perfectly showed off the raptor’s midriff. One wouldn’t expect someone who lived the kind of life Reed does to have such a chiseled midsection, but the proof was as clear as day here. Last were a simple pair of knee-high socks in orange with a black trim. Despite the minimal gap between the end of the skirt and his knees it was still easy to pick out the well-defined muscles of his thighs, as well as the socks being thin enough to show off the full definition of his calves. Reed didn’t seem the slightest bit embarrassed to be seen like this either. He smiled over at his human friend with the same glowing grin he always possessed. </p><p>Anon analyzed him top to bottom over and over, the evolved caveman was well secured in his sexuality, but the sight of Reed in a cheerleading outfit certainly was something to behold. </p><p>“Reed... Uh, what are you wearing?” </p><p>“Cheerleading outfit, obviously bro,” he then held up a bright orange pom-pom, shaking it around a bit to get some motion behind it, “What are you doing in the locker room on Saturday?” </p><p>“Beautification stuff again.” </p><p>“Sucks man, did you get caught torrenting porn on the Wi-Fi again?” </p><p>“It wasn’t porn it was Sat-,” Anon manages to catch himself before opening that pandora’s box. Once again, he reminded himself that no one must know about Saturnia, “S-some TV show. I wanted to catch up on the episodes I’ve missed.” </p><p>“Ah, makes sense bro. Still, is it worth the weekend work and all?” </p><p>“I think it is, I really like the show.  At least this time it doesn’t involve gardening.” </p><p>“Dude, can’t keep up with Rosa out in the field or something?” Reed held back a slight chuckle as he looked at Anon with a smug grin. </p><p>“It’s really hard to keep up with a Hispanic dino powered by tamales and steadfast prayer.” </p><p>“You just gotta find that extra gear of your own, man. Gotta drive forward and better yourself through some hard work and determination.” </p><p>Anon rolled his eyes as he was essentially called a slacker by a stoner, even if he did have a point. “Still, none of this explains why you’re wearing a girl’s cheerleading outfit, Reed.” </p><p>“Oh right! Right, Stacy asked about it for some yearbook photo or something.” </p><p>“You do know we have men’s outfits, right?” </p><p>“Yeah, but this is what Stacy requested. Something about the girls dressing up in football gear and us guys dressing up like the cheerleaders.” </p><p>“STILL, we have outfits for guys.” </p><p>“I mean, Adam is doing it too.” </p><p>“If Adam jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?” </p><p>“Dunno man, depends on what’s off the side of the bridge, how tall it is, the weather...” </p><p>“That’s not the point, Reed.” </p><p>“Oh, well, speaking of Adam I should check on him,” Reed then leaned around Anon facing towards the showers and shouting over to them, “Hey Adam, you alright bro?” </p><p>On cue, Adam poked out of one of the shower stalls where he had been changing. He tossed his clothes aside to a bag he had left. He was equally done up in a cheerleading outfit, identical to the one Reed had on. The exposed midriff doing a hell of a job showing off his six-pack abs which Anon tried his hardest to not stare at for any longer than his quick observation required. </p><p>“Yeah, just gotta get the socks on then my shoes,” he spotted Anon standing there with Reed and gave him a cursory wave as he headed for one of the benches, “Hey Anon, Stacy ask you to come be a part of this as well?” </p><p>“I... No, she didn’t, and I wouldn’t have gone along with it if she did. </p><p>“Why not? Just a quick thing for a photo, not like we’re going out to cheerlead a game or something.” </p><p>“Yeah bro, even Nathan’s doing it!” </p><p>Anon could only imagine how Nathan was feeling right now. Likely had the most unamused look on his face and was likely already out there just to go ahead and get it over with. Now was his time to invent a way out of this before they dragged him into it for sure. Time to put those monkey brain neurons to work. </p><p>“Because, I have to clean the locker room, and I don’t want Principal Spears to come and suplex me for not doing it.” </p><p>“Bummer bro, but totally get you on that one.” </p><p>“Yeah, good call. Hey Reed, I’m all set, you ready to go?” </p><p>Reed then shot a pair of finger guns over to Adam, holding the pom-poms in his middle and ring fingers causing them to stick out like magazines, “Yeah bro, let’s go check in with the girls outside. Catch ya later Anon, stay frosty bro.” </p><p>Reed then shot Anon a single finger gun of his own before walking over to Adam and walking out the exit with him. All Anon could focus on was a pair of raptor tails swaying and flicking back and forth from under those skirts as the duo made their way out of the locker room. Now alone once again, he was left to both contemplate and fully take in all of what he just saw. </p><p>At least his heterosexuality was still intact, hopefully. </p></div>
