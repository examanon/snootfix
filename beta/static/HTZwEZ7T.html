                    <p>Garden of Rosa</p><p>​</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>We reserve this moment to bring you a thought from Anon’s frantic and sex-crazed brain:</p><p>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!</p><p>THERE’S A GIRL IN MY ROOM AND SHE’S GETTING NAKED AND SHE’S ON MY BED AHHHHHHHHHH!</p><p>AND SHE’S ON TOP OF ME AND RAPTER JESUS FUCKING CHRIST SHE’S HOT AND SMELLS NICE AHHHHHHH!</p><p>Thank you. We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.</p><p>Pinned as I was, with Rosa straddling my waist, it was all I could do but watch as she slowly stripped off her dress, the silky-sheer black slip underneath giving me a tasteful peak at her nudity before it was removed completely. Rosa was wearing the very bra that had jabbed me in the ass the other day, a gorgeous black-and-red silk number embroidered with small flowers. She wore a match set of panties as well; a tasteful number of auburn pubes poking out from the side. Slowly, Rosa reached behind her, unhooking her bra and letting her huge breasts swing free, each of which I seriously doubted would fit in the palm of my hand. They were perfect, large and perky, her paler underbelly striping the majority of them white. Her areola were large, contrasting nicely with her pale scales, each nipple poking out firmly like the buds of a flower.</p><p>“Oh, mi amor, how I’ve waited for this…” Rosa purred in a low, sultry voice thick with need. My ears did the sensible thing at this moment; redirecting everything they heard away from my brain and directly to my dick. I felt like I was about to explode out of my jeans at this point, erecting a pedestal which Rosa seemed more than happy to sit atop of. Moaning, Rosa leaned down, locking me in a deep kiss as her hands traced the waistband of my pants. A heavy thumping came from behind Rosa, and I could feel the reverberations through the mattress as her thick tail wagged happily on the edge of the bed.</p><p>“Oowoo, what’s this, mi amor? Do you find me sexy?” Rosa seemed to be enjoying herself at my expense quite a bit, giving me a throaty giggle as she ran her hands down her curves, only a slight shyness in her eyes betraying her sexual bravado. Laying back on the bed, I drank in her little show, watching as her fingers traced every part of her naked body, smiling as Rosa captured my attention like a snake charmer. “Maybe all that love talk was to just get me into bed, eh An-on?” </p><p>No Rosa, it was not.</p><p>Me and my damn mumbling.</p><p>It wasn’t until I glanced up from Rosa’s enticing hands that I noticed she was blushing furiously, a shy smile on her face. “An-on, you really are a hopeless romantic at heart, aren’t you?” We both laughed at that, the mood shifting down somewhat from ‘unbelievably erotically charged’ to ‘two horny teenagers getting it on’. Reaching up, I could just about manage pulling Rosa’s head to mine if I propped myself up, locking her in deep kiss as she pulled my belt free at last. We stayed like that as long as we could, our tongues deep inside the other’s mouth, before the cramps in our necks from bending to our respective extremes forced us apart. Rosa paused, her face as red as I’ve ever seen it, hands hooked on the inside of my pants.</p><p>“I-I’ve never done this with anyone, mi amor. So if I do something wrong…” Rosa trailed off, looking like she might die from embarrassment. God damn she was cute! Smiling, I took her hands in mine for a moment, giving them the little squeeze that had become our favorite way to communicate.</p><p>“Rosa, it’s okay. We can go as far as you want. I, uh, haven’t exactly done this either, so…” Now it was my turn for my face to light up. “I’m her for you, mi amor.” The pet name sounded nice as I said it, causing me to break out in a huge grin once more.</p><p>“Ay, An-on, why do you have to be so cute?! H-here, let me get these off…” Rosa struggled with my jeans, pulling them down awkwardly as she continued to straddle my waist. I helped her pull them the rest of the way off, bucking my hips up off the bed as I did so. Unfortunately, this also rammed my boner right into Rosa’s crotch. Squealing in surprise, Rosa nearly fell onto the floor as she attempted to hop off my lap, managing at the last second to catch herself on the edge of the bed. Rosa just sat there, practically quaking in religious guilt, her face in her hands. Still struggling to extricate myself from my denim prison, I could only admire the cute way her snout stuck out from between her hands.</p><p>“¡Ay, demasiado pronto para eso, An-on! Oh, Raptor Jesús perdóname…” </p><p>I sat up in a flash, moving to wrap my arms around Rosa’s shoulders in comfort. “Shit, Rosa I’m sorry! Look, if you’re uncomfortable with this, we can-“</p><p>“No! No, An-on, I-I want to do this! J-just, uh, maybe not THAT yet, mi amor.” Rosa peeked out at me from behind her fingers, her crimson eyes shining. “P-please don’t hate me, mi amor, but no sex, not before we’re married…” Rosa returned my hug, nuzzling her face into my chest. It sounded like she was about to cry.</p><p>“Rosa, shhh, it’s okay. That’s okay, no sex before marriage.” I agreed, ignoring as my caveman brain screamed out in impotent rage at what my stupid mouth was saying. Stroking Rosa’s hair, I relished the sweet smell of her shampoo, the delicate floral aroma I’ve come to love.  “I know it’s important to you, and, well… You’re worth waiting for, Rosa.”</p><p>“Ay, so many cheap lines!” Rosa laughed into my chest, pulling just far enough away to place her hands on my chest. “Whatever am I going to do with you…” I let Rosa’s hands push be back onto my elbows, my legs awkwardly crumped beneath me. “Well, let me SHOW you, An-on! No sex before marriage doesn’t mean we can no do anything, si?” Rosa shifts off the bed, pulling my legs off the sides as she sits between them, snagging my pillow for her knees. “Just sit back, mi amor, and enjoy…” </p><p> Before I can respond, Rosa quiets me by flashing me a wicked grin as she tugs my boxers down my ankles in one swift motion. She gives another throaty chuckle as my solider springs to attention, moving her face until my shaft lies directly above her. “Ay, tan grande, An-on…” She murmurs, nuzzling my nuts with her nose before sliding her long herbivore tongue up my length. I can’t help but moan, letting my head lean back a bit. As Rosa gets to the top, she gives me another kiss before stuffing her mouth, taking all of me easily. </p><p>“Ah, fuck, Rosa, that’s so good…” I whisper, my hands clenching on the bedsheets as she bobs up and down. This whole time Rosa’s eyes have been locked onto mine, smoldering seductively as she went about wetting my whistle. Pausing to shuffle forward slightly, Rosa takes my hands, interlocking her fingers with mine as she quickens her pace. Holding me freely in her mouth, Rosa has no trouble gulping and sucking me to completion. Despite my efforts to hold out as long as I can, Rosa looks too damn sexy, her hand-holding just too damn cute. “Shit, Rosa I’m gonna-“</p><p>Rosa doesn’t let me finish, instead taking me down to the base as she squeezes my hands. Our little hand-squeeze takes on a whole new meaning this time, and I can almost swear she’s squeezing in rhythm to my pulses. Another loud groan escapes my lips as I writhe against Rosa’s mouth, screwing my eyes shut tight as my wildest dream cums (I couldn’t resist, sorry) true. </p><p>I can feel Rosa holding me in her mouth until I finish, still squeezing my hands until the final jolt passes through my legs. Falling down onto the bed with a heavy sigh, I’m content to lie there, boxers around my ankles, panting as Rosa busies herself in the bathroom. After some spitting and a quick rinse with the faucet, Rosa crawls onto the bed next to me, cuddling herself against me. </p><p>“W-where…Where did you…learn to do that?” I pant, laying one arm over my eyes as Rosa tucks the other around herself, nuzzling close beside me. Giggling, Rosa just kisses my chest, her tail slowly curling around my leg.</p><p>“A dama never kisses and tells, An-on.” Even more kisses are planted on my chest, slowly creeping higher towards my neck, my cheek. “Besides, now it is your turn, mi amor…” Pulling my arm off my face, Rosa plants a kiss on my hand before slowly guiding it down her body. I shift slightly, finding Rosa’s lips with my own as I gently stroke the little tuft of pubes sticking out of her panties. </p><p>Alright, time to put all my /rock-9k/ knowledge into practice.</p><p>Slowly, I gently peel back the silky fabric, all the while keeping my lips locked with Rosa’s. Slipping my hand inside, I can feel the softness of Rosa’s garden as I awkwardly fumble downwards. I try not to focus too much on how clumsy I must feel as I tease and press against Rosa’s clit, especially compared to how expertly Rosa managed to get me off. I can feel how wet Rosa is already as I tease her, every gentle brush across her most sensitive area eliciting a quiet moan from the sexy ankylosaur. Rosa’s body is writhing under my touch, grinding against my hand while also pressing her heaving breasts against my chest. I increase my pace with the understanding that whatever I’m doing must feel good; Rosa’s beginning to squirm so much now, it’s hard to keep my position and still continue our tonsil tango. </p><p>Finally, Rosa can’t take it any longer. Breaking our kiss, Rosa lets out a quick staccato of Spanish, reaching down to press my fingers into her harder. My hand is soaking now as I plunge even deeper into her, my fingers pressing parts of Rosa that I’ve never touched before. With one final shriek directly into my ear, Rosa’s back begins to arch, her mouth forming wordless screams as her innermost folds begin to clamp down around my questing digits. Unsure of how long I should keep this up, I inadvertently keep Rosa’s orgasm going to way, way too long, before she collapses into my chest totally and utterly spent, her legs still twitching slightly as she lies motionless on top of me. </p><p>Gently, I extract my hand from Rosa’s panties, acutely aware of just how slick and moist my fingers have become. Smiling, I lean down to kiss the prone woman’s hair, attempting to no avail to shift my now-numb arm out from under her. I can feel a wet trickle start to form on my chest, where Rosa’s face is currently smushed up against. Wait, is she… </p><p>A soft snore confirms my suspicions. She fell asleep! </p><p>I can feel my own eyes begin to droop as I lean down to kiss Rosa’s hair once more. There’s no way I can use this arm, come tomorrow morning. Ah, fuck it; that’s an issue for tomorrow Anon. I close my eyes, deciding that sleeping with Rosa is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me. Pulling the slightly sweat-dampened sheets over us both, I lean back against the mattress, regretting not snagging my pillow from the floor. My muscles don’t even ache anymore as I hug Rosa tightly to me, savoring this moment as long as I can before I drift off to sleep.</p><p>“I love you, mi amor.”</p>
