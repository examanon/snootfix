                    <p>December 28th, 201M2019 BC</p><p>â€‹</p><p>Now, I know you don't like doing this, but we need to have a little heart to heart.</p><p>You're in a new home, a new town, and there's no one looking at you.</p><p>That's perfect. That's exactly what you're supposed to be doing. You'd better keep it up this time.</p><p>Do you think I should tell you why you did that? Leave it all behind?</p><p>No?</p><p>Well, that's too bad. I'm going to remind you once again.</p><p>Just to make sure you know what you're doing.</p><p>There you were, Rock Bottom, having the time of your life.</p><p>With no one suspicious of you.</p><p>No one to come close to you.</p><p>No one to be hurt by you.</p><p>And then, one day...</p><p>Nope, you're not getting out of this. You need to remember your mistakes.</p><p>One day, you met the most beautiful velociraptor alive.</p><p>That beautiful, striking red. You couldn't take your eyes off it!</p><p>Her messy hair, her no nonsense attitude, you loved it.</p><p>...And you loved her.</p><p>So, you confessed your feelings for her, and she did so back to you.</p><p>You two were like peas in a pod. You both were inseparable.</p><p>Only held back by the limits of time.</p><p>But that was a mistake.</p><p>Letting people get close to you? You know how that turns out. Every time.</p><p>You two had been together for almost a year.</p><p>Even within that amount of time, your bond became unbreakable.</p><p>Until they came along.</p><p>Those God-damn gangsters, who just wanted to stick it to you.</p><p>Simply for being a part of an enemy gang.</p><p>It wasn't even personal. They just wanted to make anyone who may have been associated suffer.</p><p>The Shots. They had already killed your parents a long time ago, but now they were back for more.</p><p>When they found out where you were, they took her from you.</p><p>You didn't even get to say goodbye.</p><p>You couldn't protect her.</p><p>There it was: Her bullet-ridden corpse left right in your backyard to rot.</p><p>Those ocean-blue eyes turned dull and hollow, devoid of any color.</p><p>The beautiful raptor who had brought light into your life was gone.</p><p>All because you thought you could try to be someone else.</p><p>You're a wood-chipper.</p><p>People don't get hurt because that was the intention of your creation, but it's because they get too close.</p><p>You have no quarrel against them, it is a simple law of nature.</p><p>Unlike the wood-chipper, however, it is still your fault. You have the sentience to understand this rule, but you ignore it.</p><p>Every single time you think you can change, this happens.</p><p>No exceptions.</p><p>If you knew how to protect them, maybe you could live a normal life.</p><p>But, no.</p><p>You couldn't protect her, and you can't protect anyone now.</p><p>What if this happens in the future?</p><p>Are you going to just let them die again?</p><p>Are you going to allow innocent bystanders to suffer just because they wanted to be with you?</p><p>How are you going to protect them?</p><p>You don't do a good job at saving lives.</p><p>So, that's why you've done this again.</p><p>Leave it all behind.</p><p>Of course, you made sure her murderers were served justice, but even with that you'd overstayed your welcome.</p><p>Her parents knew about everything that happened, and began to know who you really were.</p><p>So... you gave them mercy in their last moments.</p><p>You could never risk a chance of allowing anybody to report your identity to the authorities.</p><p>You've done too much.</p><p>If they ever caught you, you'd die.</p><p>You may regret killing them and making it look like an accident for the rest of your life...</p><p>but it's a sacrifice you had to take.</p><p>That was one sacrifice.</p><p>The other was officially leaving your gang behind, letting it fade into the back of your mind.</p><p>Your boss was saddened by your decision, but in the end, he understood your intentions.</p><p>He even said to you "If yous ever got anyone giving yous trouble, let us know."</p><p>The faceless boss may have never given you 100% of his trust, but he still treated you like a son.</p><p>Especially ever since your parent's deaths.</p><p>He was like a father to you, and you made sure to let him know that.</p><p>It's good to see he still cares for you and understands your choice.</p><p>In the end, after you finished your errands, you ran.</p><p>You ran as far as possible, leaving no trace of yourself.</p><p>Now, you're someone else.</p><p>You don't have a name for anyone to track you down and look inside you.</p><p>You've disappeared.</p><p>You are Anonymous.</p><p>You're just another background character deep in the crowd.</p><p>You'll have no one to love, no outside friend who understands you.</p><p>In the end, that's okay.</p><p>Do you see why I'm telling you all of this?</p><p>It's so you don't screw this up.</p><p>You may not like having no one, but it's something you're willing to accept.</p><p>You're just... Anonymous.</p><p>And now, no more innocent people will be hurt by you.</p><p>It's better this way.</p><p>For you, and for everyone.</p>
