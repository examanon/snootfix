                    <p>Title: Spears' Endeavors In Parenting</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Samantha, Ripley, Spears</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: SaltyAnon</p><p>​</p><p>>Principal Spears was a simple caveman.</p><p>>He loved his wife, he loved his job, he loved his three daughters, and he loved his students</p><p>>He truly wanted for naught</p><p>>But known to none but himself, Spears desired a son</p><p>>His grates shame as the man who had it all</p><p>>Just someone to go on fishing trips with, complete traditional woodworking projects with, and to throw around the old footrock with. </p><p>>Typical father and son things</p><p>>It was one of the reasons he remained as a principal rather than taking the promotion to superintendent</p><p>>If he couldn't have father-son moments with his own children, Principal-Student moments would have to suffice</p><p>>That was until he came along</p><p>>He was perfect.</p><p>>Young, isolated from peers due to bully, and emotionally distant from his own parents</p><p>>and best of all, human</p><p>>Spears had to stop himself from calling the young man ‘sport’ when he walked into the office</p><p>>Truly there was no greater person in need of a father figure than Anon Y. Mous</p><p>>Spears had decided he would be that father figure come hell or high water.</p><p>>Unfortunately their first interaction was cut far too short, Anon merely needed a food card</p><p>>Spears directed Mrs. Hunter to get the paperwork in order while he talked to the boy</p><p>>Simple questions really</p><p>>When is your date of birth? Do you play any sports? How's your relationship with your father? Have you watched roro ni kenshin?</p><p>>Nothing too suspicious</p><p>>The rest of the day passed quickly besides a small incident in the auditorium</p><p>>Mx. Aaron, Mrs. Freeman and, Mr. Pikeman had trouble with their performance</p><p>>The trouble being the student body reacting negatively </p><p>>A bit of shouting and hollow threats kept them in line</p><p>>Anon even went</p><p>>Hopefully he was behaving himself</p><p>>Wait if he wasn’t that would mean Spears could deal out a lesson in discipline</p><p>>But that would mean he would have a delinquent son</p><p>>Spears stopped to contemplate which would be better, a delinquent or kind hearted son</p><p>>Anon was able to sneak away while spears was making his decision</p><p>>From then on Spears took a great interest in Anon’s time at school</p><p>>Parent teacher night was an interesting night indeed</p><p>>Since Anon’s parents weren't able, or more likely not willing, to attend the young man decided to stay home</p><p>>Spears had derailed that by showing up at his door</p><p>>”I heard you didn’t have a parent for parent-teacher conferences. Maybe I could be your parent for tonight?”</p><p>>Anon didn’t really have a choice in the matter as Spears picked him up over his head and placed him back down in the car waiting outside</p><p>>The whole night was a fever dream</p><p>>Spears played the part of a parent perfectly</p><p>>Even the look of disappointment when his pathetic gym marks came to light</p><p>>The principal seemed pleased with how his science and music marks turned out though</p><p>>The teachers seemed to confused with what Spears was doing as well</p><p>>On the bright side Spears took Anon to get ice cream on the way back to his home</p><p>>Anon kind of wished the night could be wiped from memory, the looks he got from other students was getting to him</p><p>>Spears on the other hand was quite happy</p><p>>He was one step closer to his endgame</p><p>>Anon’s parents seemed to be open to letting the adoption happen</p><p>>Now all Spears needed was to get the paperwork together and convince his wife</p><p>>He was planning to deal with the second one later tonight</p><p>>Spears got another bonding moment with Anon due to the young man continuing to download Saternia</p><p>>Such shit taste will need to be corrected in time</p><p>>And that time was now</p><p>>Since physical labour wasn’t effective, Spears decided to attack the problem at its source</p><p>>Anon, who had prepared for more work with the gardening club and more of Rosa’s food was more than a little frightened when he was sent directly to the principal’s office instead</p><p>>That fear was changed to befuddlement when Spears had wheeled in a small TV along with a plethora of classic Anime</p><p>>Pentagun, Spaceman Dedot, Roro ni kenshin, Outlaw Sun, and (You) (You) Hakusho to name a few</p><p>>Anon would have been down for watching anime any day</p><p>>But watching with his physically imposing principal on the weekend that normally would be for hard labour made the situation unverning</p><p>>The selection was good nonetheless, Pretty kino</p><p>>Every few episodes would be broken up by Spears discussing the history of the production and how “they don't make em like that anymore” </p><p>>Anon just nodded along</p><p>>By the time they had finished it was getting close to dinner</p><p>>Quick as a flash Anon thanked his principal and dipped while Spears turned to his filing cabinet</p><p>>He promised Fang a dinner date later after all</p><p>>This meant Spears revealed the adoption papers to an empty room</p><p>>And only that empty room would see Spears' single tear of anguish</p><p>>Eventually the last few weeks of the school year rolled up</p><p>>Many crazy things had happened</p><p>>VVORM DRAMA played an good show at a small pizza joint, or so he overheard from some of the students</p><p>>Anon got doxxed for having made some embarrassing photos by Trish, that was not a fun situation to handle</p><p>>Thankfully Anon seemed to take his fatherly advice to heart and willing to talk with her about the situation</p><p>>Spears had struggled to keep the feeling of pride from spilling out of his pockets like al dente pasta </p><p>>It had been an interesting school semester with only one flaw</p><p>>Graduation was coming soon and Spears had yet to breach the topic of adoption to Anon</p><p>>As soon as he was graduated the probability of Spears getting a chance to ask him was nil</p><p>>Thus a plan was formed</p><p>>An end of the year camping trip</p><p>>A trip that required a parents permission to attend</p><p>>Most likely Lucy, the school’s local punk rock princess, would attend the trip along with her friends</p><p>>Anon would join the trip as well to have continued hangouts with his girlfriend</p><p>>Excellent choice by the way my son</p><p>>However since Anon’s parents were not around to sign it the responsibility would fall to him as principal to give permission</p><p>>And thus the adoption papers could be presented</p><p>>Truly devious Spears</p><p>>So imagine his surprise when Anon showed up on the last day with a signed permission slip</p><p>>From the Aaron no less</p><p>>Was this a joke of some sort</p><p>>The smug looks of satisfaction shot in his direction from Ripley, Samantha, and even young Naser proved otherwise</p><p>>The family pulled Anon and Lucy into a tight family group hug, still holding his gaze</p><p>>So that's how it was going to be then</p><p>>Spears walked over to discuss the fact of their signatures on Anon slip</p><p>>Ripley spoke up first “Well the kid had been hanging around our little Lucy a good bit now so we thought why not, I’d hate to ruin young love”</p><p>>Then Samantha “Besides the sheet said parent or guardian and we’ve been having over so much lately he's practically like another son”</p><p>>That was disconcerting but understandable</p><p>>If he could see how much Anon need proper parental units in his life so could others</p><p>>The Aarons may have a leg up on him due to their relation through Fang</p><p>>But that wouldn’t stop Principal Spears Primal</p><p>>On his ancestor Jack Samurai’s honor, he would adopt that boy</p><p>>The principal bid the Aarons farewell and jumped on the bus</p><p>>The trip went as smoothly as expected with a bus pack full of hormonal teenagers</p><p>>Upon arriving at the campsite Spears was given another surprise</p><p>>The rest of the Aaron family was there</p><p>>”Don’t worry about us, we were just taking a small vacation up to our cottage near here. And don't be surprised if we steal Lucy and her boyfriend every once and awhile.”</p><p>>The words of the matriarch shook Spears to his core</p><p>>Clearly this excursion would not be so simple</p><p>>In fact it seemed to be an uphill battle</p><p>>Spears vs the Aarons</p><p>>A series of wacky hijinks to monopolize Anon’s time ensued</p><p>>Spears started strong by calling the students to a nearby lake for swimming with the intention to teach Anon swimming much like his father before him</p><p>>Riply countered by taking Anon onto the middle lake for fishing, just father and future son in law</p><p>>Spears quickly hurled a large rock onto one side of the boat flinging Anon back to dry land before they could get too far out</p><p>>Anon was then swept up by Samantha who had made snacks</p><p>>This is how the entire trip proceeded, two groups of adults fighting to take control of parenting a young man on the cusp of adulthood</p><p>>All Anon wanted to do was sneak into the forest to make out with Fang</p><p>>In the end no one got what they wanted</p>
