<h1>Perfect Situation Chapter 5</h1><div><p>Chapter 5: Despair</p><p>​</p><p>When we finally pulled into Trish's parking lot my skull was pounding. I almost didn't believe it when the silence returned. My world had been consumed by a language I barely understood for so long that the lack of it was a flashbang to the senses. I exited Rosa's car quickly, eager to escape on the chance she turned her horrid music back on. Stella followed after me, looking similarly dazed though she had been looking like that all day. Rosa moved to join us but stopped when she spied the Trigga Truck.</p><p>"Eso es ridículo" she shook her head disapprovingly.</p><p>At least I think that's what she said, My ears were still ringing. Following her gaze I was surprised at the appearance of another car parked along side it. That was strange, did she call a doctor or something? She didn't seem sick enough for that but she was definitely a woman concerned for her health. I took the lead and the two of them fell in behind me, I noted that she kept her lawn well maintained. Where on earth did that woman find the time? Stepping up to the door of Trish's modest little home I rapped my knuckles against it. We waited a short while but that was to be expected, I'm sure she had to drag herself out of bed. When the door finally opened Trish seemed ecstatic to see us, I was hit with a wave of nostalgia when I saw she was wearing her old hoodie.</p><p>"Glad you could make it!" She chirped, pulling me down for a hug that I returned. Spying Rosa and Stella from over my shoulder she gasped and rushed to meet them, throwing an arm around each their necks for another hug.</p><p>"N-nice to see you too, Trish" Stella squeaked around her bicep</p><p>"It is no coincidence that we are reunited on the day of our lord" Rosa agreed with full conviction</p><p>Having got her greeting out of the way, Trish invited us all inside. Inside her very dark house, where the curtains were drawn and lights were off. I'm sure she was sleeping until now but wasn't somebody else over too? As soon as Trish closed the door and with it the only light source there was a click and the house itself lit up.</p><p>"HAPPY ONE MONTH ANNIVERSARY!" A chorus of voices called out, some louder than others.</p><p>I blinked, reeling from having to rapidly adjust to the light. There were streamers along the ceiling and even a few balloons, A tray of snacks had been laid out and stacks of cans had been set aside on a table. To my disbelief a pink raptor stood up from behind the couch, a grin plastered on his face. Reed!? Somehow he wasn't even the most surprising thing in this room, That was the young girl in the corner. She looked like Trish in miniature, an impressive feat for someone already so small. Why did Trish never mention her? What was all this even for!? My mouth worked, but my brain couldn't decide what was more important. At least Stella and Rosa seemed as confused as I was.</p><p>"Alright, one question at a time" Trish stood next to me with her traditional smirk, the deja-vu of seeing it paired with her hoodie was intense</p><p>"Daughter?" I choked out</p><p>"Sister."</p><p>"Reed?"</p><p>"Wanted to see you"</p><p>"Sick?"</p><p>"You believed that?"</p><p>"Party?"</p><p>Her smirk softened, resting her hand on my shoulder "You deserve it, dummy. You know how many people quit their routine in a week? That's just exercise, you've cut down on smoking, you're more confident, you even went to church today! You've come a long way from that trash pile I found you in. You're the best assistant a girl could ask for and you don't make a half bad punching bag either." She punctuated it with a slap on the back, it did little to dissuade the warmth growing in my chest or the color in my cheeks.</p><p>"Besides, I like to send a gift basket to people that stick to their plan for a month. It takes two weeks to build a habit but I do a month to be sure. Represents independence y'know? You're just lucky they were out of baskets." She sniffed dismissively, she wasn't a very good actor.</p><p>I heard clapping from behind me and to my surprise it was Stella.</p><p>"Congratulations" she said, tilting her head and smiling at me.</p><p>"Congratulations ¡niño!" Rosa clapped excitedly as she followed suit</p><p>"Yeah, congratulations man" Reed drawled, joining in</p><p>"Congratulations, Anon" This time it was Trish, politely clapping along</p><p>"Congratulations... I guess..." Even Trish's sister was peer pressured into it, though she didn't sound very enthused</p><p>Standing amidst all this applause I suddenly felt very self-conscious. looking back at the instigator I saw a devious glint in her eye despite her lazy smile, god damnit Stella, you had to do your anime reference even now? Fortunately everyone got their fill quickly enough. Rosa and Stella wasted little time taking the couch so they could sample the snacks. I saw Reed fiddling with a laptop and some speakers, guess it's not a party without music. Trish steered me towards her sister, she was definitely too young for high school but she still had that awkward teenage ganglyness. Middle school then?</p><p>"Sorry about springing this on you, I'm just cautious about Tana meeting new men" she whispered as she pulled me along</p><p>"What? Why?" I mumbled back, why men specifically?</p><p>She just pinched my arm, we were too close to Tana now to speak privately. The girl in question looked up at me beneath a long tuft a hair with apathy at best, disdain at worst. I could see studded bracers around her wrist and a distinct lack of color in her apparel, the rebellious type then.</p><p>"Tana, this is Anon." Trish's voice was surprisingly motherly, almost too much so, it was like she was talking to a toddler.</p><p>Tana's expression didn't change as her gaze slid to Trish "I know, you've talked about him before"</p><p>Trish's smile faltered a bit "I wanted you two to meet. He's a very good friend of mine."</p><p>I gave Tana a half-hearted wave, she barely spared a glance my way. This was awkward.</p><p>"I met him. Can I go to my room now?" she flipped her hair dismissively, voice totally monotone</p><p>Trish sighed "Sure, Tana. Go ahead. Do you want me to read you a story tonight?" Her voice was so fragile, I think story time meant more to Trish than it did Tana.</p><p>"I'm not a little kid anymore, god." was Tana's predictable response before she stomped off</p><p>It felt wrong watching a headstrong woman like Trish get utterly trampled by a pre-teen. Trish and I were close at this point but this felt like a side of her that was too intimate to share among friends. I was about to try and cheer her up when Trish sighed.</p><p>"Sorry about that" she sounded disappointed.</p><p>I shrugged at her "Don't worry about it. Kids are cruel, Trish."</p><p>Trish cocked her head and looked up at me curiously "You think so?"</p><p>I nodded seriously "I am very in touch with my inner child".</p><p>She looked confused at the implication but I heard Reed howling across the living room, 5 years separated and my bro still had it.</p><p>"Dude, nice!" he shot me his classic finger gun.</p><p>Trish looked exasperated when I returned fire.</p><p>"I need a drink. Why don't you go talk with your boyfriend?" She grumbled, not bothering to wait for my response before she walked over to the table and cracked open a can.</p><p>Not a bad idea honestly, I could use a bit of levity after Tana and I needed to catch up with him anyways. Reed was still hunched over his laptop, tapping away at something with his tail swishing occasionally. I'm not sure what he was doing because he had the music going just fine, some trashy pop song currently. I sat down and grabbed something from the snack tray before Stella and Rosa devoured them all, cheese and crackers, guess you can't go wrong with the classics. Looking at Reed he seemed barely touched by time, his arms had thinned so I guess he stopped playing the drums. Actually at a closer look he seemed thinner in general.</p><p>I briefly worried he wasn't getting enough to eat but while Fang was skeletal, Reed just seemed lithe. Maybe it was his posture or maybe it was my virginity talking but it wouldn't be a stretch to call him feminine. Fortunately he finished whatever he was doing and walked over, plopping his fluffy tail in the last remaining seat he held out his fist to me. A fist I gladly met with my own, with the customary finger wiggle after our knuckles parted of course.</p><p>"How's life been treating you, man?" Reed asked me, still getting comfortable in his seat. Was his voice always this high pitched?</p><p>It was an innocent question but it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had been so distracted by actually living that I hadn't really stopped to consider it. I used to think life was going to treat me like shit and I was going to treat it shit right back. I had convinced myself that I had missed some critical juncture. I looked across to Stella, she had her phone out and was showing Rosa something, the latina caught me staring and shot me a smile. I could see Trish in the kitchen collecting enough cans for everyone, her tail wagging as she did so. Reed was looking at me expectantly, I guess I was taking too long to answer. I was surrounded by old friends that I never expected to see again. It felt good, great even but there was one monochromatic weirdo still missing.</p><p>"Can't complain." I said, it was the truth. What I had was more than I deserved.</p><p>Reed seemed disappointed at such a simple answer "Yeah, that's usually how it goes"</p><p>"But I'm not going to stop until it's better" I added with a grin.</p><p>"Ha! Now that's what I'm talking about!" He agreed enthusiastically</p><p>"What about you Reed, what have you been up to?" I was genuinely curious, I always figured he'd be homeless after school.</p><p>"It was real harsh when you and Fang broke it off. She and Trish got into a big argument soon after and then she left. No band without Fang so all I had left was machines y'know? I could get 'em working on the outside but on the inside? Had to practice that. Turns out I was pretty good so I kept doin' it. Eventually I showed some company my stuff and bam I was suddenly employed."</p><p>I took a moment to process that information, Trish never mentioned a fight. Reed also never mentioned what he actually did.</p><p>"So what do you actually do?"</p><p>Reed chuckled "I'm a programmer, man. Got the socks to prove it."</p><p>I couldn't help it, I looked down. His legs were covered by pants, socks weren't visible but they could be hiding just beneath the surface...</p><p>Stella perked up however "Oh, you are? That's wonderful. I was actually looking to hire one for a project".</p><p>I dared not consider what manner of project Stella needed a programmer for.</p><p>"Sick! You'll have to slide the deets my way" Reed had no such compulsion it seems.</p><p>"I think this calls for a celebration. Anyone got a light?" Reed asked, fishing out some home-wrapped nonsense.</p><p>I was already reaching for my lighter when Trish appeared behind him and snatched the doobie from his lips.</p><p>"No. Smoking. Indoors." She enunciated each word by poking him in the snout with his own joint. I forgot how anal Trish was about smoking.</p><p>"Aww man... " He was actually pouting.</p><p>"Do you have any idea how hard it is to get the smell of smoke out of a house?" She asked expectantly, hands on her hips.</p><p>Now that she mentioned it, I'm pretty sure I did smell smoke. It wasn't anywhere near fresh, it was the barest suggestion of a cigarette beneath layers of other smells but it was there. Why would Trish's house smell like that? I doubt anyone else could tell, it was only the fact that my apartment smelled just like it that let me notice in the first place. My musing was interrupted with a thud as Trish dropped a box of beer on the now empty snack table. She tossed each of us a can and grabbed one for herself, guess this is what she was drinking in the kitchen. Staring at the can of beer in my hands I felt a sense of trepidation. I certainly had my vices but alcohol was never one of them, that night on the beach made sure of that. No one else seemed too concerned as they each cracked open their prize, We were all friends here right? I could feel my thoughts darken, Fang and I were more than friends and alcohol ruined that too. I forced myself to pop the top before I could dwell too much, Anon Y. Mous refused to be scared of cheap beer. However as soon as I moved my arm off its rest to take a sip Trish planted her stupidly perfect ass on it.</p><p>"Hey! I wasn't using that or anything" I scoffed, pretending to be upset.</p><p>Trish looked down at me for a change "You see anywhere else to sit?" she asked, clearly amused.</p><p>"The floors right there".</p><p>She gently thwapped me with her tail. Fine, be that way.</p><p>The introduction of alcohol seems to have loosened everyone's lips and we quickly lost a few hours to chatter and drinks. Stella and Reed were discussing their project in slow motion, Reed picking up on Stella's lethargy. Trish and Rosa were swapping history until Rosa made the mistake of asking Trish about losing a few pounds. That would keep the two of them busy for a while, I pulled out my phone so I could check on Fang. Read message but no reply, I couldn't prevent the sigh escaping my lips. Shouldn't have gotten my hopes up, it was still too early for her. I debated sending her another text but Reed piped up enthusiastically.</p><p>"Dudes, we should play a party game!" he looked at everyone for confirmation.</p><p>"I think I have monopoly?" Trish added unhelpfully, why would you unleash that on your friends?</p><p>Thankfully Reed shook his head "Nah, check it. Never have I ever left Volcadera Bluff"</p><p>Ah, so it was one of these. I raised my hand and took a drink "Navy. I'll tell you about it later." Most here had heard the story after all.</p><p>Reed looked excited for that but it was Rosa who spoke up "Never have I ever been in a fight, Pon la otra mejilla." she drew a cross across her chest.</p><p>Unsurprisingly Trish and I raised our hands but Reed did as well, we all looked at him questioningly.</p><p>"Look, man. Some people really want their carfe without paying. You know?" He shrugged nonchalantly as if beating up junkies was totally normal.</p><p>My turn then. "Never have I ever binge watched an entire series" I looked at Stella with a knowing grin.</p><p>Predictably the stegosaur took a sip and raised her hand "not fair" she mumbled. That got a laugh out of everyone.</p><p>Trish downed her can and grabbed another, she was really putting those away. Ignoring her head start in the kitchen she was still a few beers ahead of anyone else.</p><p>"Alright I got one" she took a hearty sip before continuing "Never have I ever kissed someone".</p><p>She looked expectantly at us but not a soul raised their hand, not even me.</p><p>"Ohhh noo..." She moaned, sliding off the armrest and into my lap, hooking an arm around my neck to keep herself upright. I jumped in surprise, Or tried to anyways, she was really heavy for such a small woman. We chuckled at her theatrics but there were going to be questions after something like that.</p><p>Rosa spoke up first, her voice distraught "No kisses? Even as a niñita?"</p><p>It was Reed that answered her "Nahhhh, Trish beat up boys. She didn't kiss them"</p><p>"Don't worry Trish, I didn't get my first kiss until prom" Stella added gently.</p><p>"Ugh, even Stella." Trish groaned, practically laying across my lap.</p><p>Stella puffed up, indignant. "What do you mean, even Stella!? I do stuff!"</p><p>She deflated almost immediately when everyone stared at her expectantly.</p><p>"Uhm, Never have I ever done drugs?" She offered tentatively.</p><p>Every hand in the room shot up, I knew Trish had done carfe and Reed is Reed but Rosa?</p><p>"We are imperfect souls, that is why we need to be saved" Rosa somehow managed to sound pious about smoking weed. Impressive.</p><p>Trish had taken to shifting in her seat, my lap, which had the unfortunate effect of grinding her rear into my crotch. Alright anon, think unsexy thoughts. Why did I have to drink? It was so hard to focus on anything but that warm friction. Eventually she found the right spot, sending an electric current up my spine.</p><p>"Uh, Trish? Could you stop that?" I grunted, fighting a losing battle against my body.</p><p>"Could you be more comfortable?" she asked coyly.</p><p>Despite her answer she thankfully stopped her ministrations and I could return my attention to the game.</p><p>Reed opened his mouth to start the new round but Rosa's phone rang, a medley of mexican music drowning out the pop trash Reed had left on. She held it to her ear and let out a flurry of spanish, there wasn't any talking around Rosa when she got going so we waited patiently for her. When she tapped her phone again she smiled apologetically.</p><p>"Sorry everyone, Mi esposo needs me. Ready to head home Stella?"</p><p>The lime green girl looked hesitant, I didn't blame her. I don't think my ears will ever recover from that car ride with Rosa.</p><p>"Actually, I'd like to stay and talk with Reed about our project. You don't mind driving me home, right Reed?" She turned her pleading blue eyes on Reed.</p><p>"Not a problem, dudette" he replied casually, gay or not no man could say no to those eyes.</p><p>With Rosa's absence the mood dampened slightly, She brought a lot of energy to the room. Reed didn't seem dissuaded however.</p><p>"Alright, one more. Never have I ever danced at prom." Well that was weirdly specific.</p><p>Only Stella raised a confused hand, I looked at both Reed and Trish curiously</p><p>"Didn't you two go to prom together?" I asked.</p><p>Reed shook his head "technically, but I was the DJ. No time for dancing"</p><p>"Should've seen my dress.." Trish muttered bitterly around her can of beer</p><p>Stella looked apprehensive, I didn't know what to say either.</p><p>Trish looked pensive for a moment "Hold on! I'll be back" she exclaimed, suddenly excited about something. She stood up on shakey legs and after a moment to get her footing she managed not to stumble her way down the hall. I had gotten so used to her weight and warmth that it felt wrong to have her absent.</p><p>"Yeah, me too actually. Gotta get somethin' from the car." Reed stood as well, leaving me and Stella alone.</p><p>I leaned back in my seat, head swimming from hours of light drinking. Stella mirrored me, closing her eyes and sighing contently. I had forgotten she was woken up early today and the sun had long set by now. Still, there was something I was curious about.</p><p>"Do you still do tarot readings Stella?"</p><p>Stella cracked one eye open but the smile on her face told me she was just being coy "I see your minds eye is more open to the arcane mysteries, Anon."</p><p>I was about to ask her why she felt the need to talk like a bad gypsy parody but she pulled out her phone.</p><p>"It's not the same as with a physical deck but the power of tarot lies in the reader not the cards, this program will allow me to divine your fate." she intoned ominously</p><p>"Are you having fun, Stella?"</p><p>"Yes." She dropped her pretense quickly. "Would you like a reading?" There she goes with those eyes again.</p><p>As soon as I nodded she tapped at her screen and furrowed her brow.</p><p>"Reversed Lovers, as your first card this represents indecision. Your lack of commitment will lead to a major imbalance in your life, be honest with your fears and desires."</p><p>Another tap of the screen "Upright chariot, for your own sake you must take decisive action no matter what path you follow."</p><p>A third tap "Upright temperance, patience and understanding will ease your journey."</p><p>She looked up, eager to hear what I thought.</p><p>"That was a hell of a lot more detailed than the ones you used to give" I admitted. Impressed that I could actually decipher it while drunk</p><p>"I got better" she admitted sheepishly, curling some hair around her finger.</p><p>I smiled, that was a fun way to kill some time. Lack of commitment? Funny, I was committed to stuff for the first time in a long time. Trusting tarot cards was already silly, trusting digital tarot cards seemed even sillier. Reed returned shortly after my reading, carrying a black box of some kind. I raised an eyebrow but Reed waved me off.</p><p>"You'll see, man." He winked at me, setting it down in a corner.</p><p>Reed kneeled and started fiddling with it so I talked with Stella more. I asked her about tarot and she actually tried teaching me to read the cards themselves. I'm really not sure how Stella managed to get anything coherent from this list of adjectives if I was being honest. Stella seemed more amused than anything at my poor attempts of divining the future but was a patient teacher. Learning tarot actually managed to kill a good 20 minutes. Reed had long since finished setting up his mysterious box and was pestering me for a fortune when I heard Trish call out</p><p>"Heyyyy!" she slurred enthusiastically</p><p>Reed looked up with a smile and Stella gasped, putting the phone down I could see why. Trish had apparently spent all that time dressing up, she was wearing an utterly sinful black dress. The top was of a thin, nearly transparent black material that let me get a good view of her generous cleavage. Paired with it was opaque fabric rising halfway up her breasts so that they were actually concealed. Her crest and horns glittered gold and emerald with expensive jewelry, even her tail had golden rings and chains to complete the set. Following her tail I realized that the swell of her hips made the dress stop at the top of her thighs. Raptor Jesus have mercy upon me. I followed those toned legs all the way down to the black heels she wore.</p><p>Eager for a second look I realized that her dress was actually tiny. It was clearly a skimpy piece but Trish was a mature woman. Her bust strained the too-small top, her sculpted thighs were depressed by the tight fabric hugging her hips. Her well defined arms and thick shoulder muscles stretched the sheer material nearly transparent, even the faintest outline of her abs could be seen when the cloth hugged her just right. Trish barely fit into that dress, leaving her femininity on full display. As she posed there, hip cocked with a confident smirk on her face I swear I could hear voices from a long forgotten recess of my brain.</p><p>The cheer of electrochemistry was ecstatic. "Oh yeah baby! We. Are. Back! Mmm, love that rush of testosterone."</p><p>My physical instrument roared at me "What are you doing sitting right now!? What good is that body you've built if it's stationary? >IMAGINE."</p><p>The whisper of suggestion curled in my ear "Look at that woman. She must have dressed up just for you, champ."</p><p>The throaty rumble of my ancient reptilian brain demanded one thing. "BREED."</p><p>Silencing the cacophony with another sip of beer I struggled to find the right words to describe what I was seeing.</p><p>"Wow." I croaked. Good enough.</p><p>Trish seemed delighted despite my lack of eloquence. She even struck a pose, lifting her leg and thrusting out her bust and tail for balance. That too small dress of hers hitched up just enough that the blush on my cheeks was almost certainly not from the alcohol.</p><p>"Look at me! Aren't I the 24-year old prom dream?" She held the pose for just a moment, her smirk giving way to laughter when she stumbled.</p><p>"A really drunk prom dream" She added with a giggle and joined us in the living room.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye I saw Reed move to his laptop and hit a key. The lights suddenly flicked off, leaving us in total darkness before new ones took their place. A variety of multicolored lights suddenly illuminated room, bathing it in rich reds, blues and greens. Following the streams of light up I could see the bulbs hidden amongst the party streamers. The white noise that was the ambient pop music gave way to something with a thumping bass, with rythm. I didn't get a chance to question it because Trish stepped in front of me.</p><p>"C'mon, Anon. Lets make up for lost time." her voice was as gentle as her smile when she offered her hand to me.</p><p>I held my hand up to stop her "Woah, hold on. I can't even dance!" I tried not to sound as nervous as I felt.</p><p>Trish quirked an eyebrow, that smile of hers sharpened into a grin.</p><p>"Then I guess I'll just have to help you won't I?" she grunted as she grabbed my hand and pulled me out of my seat.</p><p>Stumbling a little after being yanked to my feet I realized that Trish still hadn't let go of my hand. Standing next to her beneath the light I could see her dress actually sparkled. Maybe I was just drunk but I could swear her eyes sparkled too.</p><p>"Wouldn't be the first time." She murmured, her grin still playful.</p><p>My dance lesson with Trish wasn't much of a lesson, I don't think Trish really knew how to dance either. It didn't seem to matter, maybe it was the alcohol or maybe it was the company but we had fun. Stella was more nervous than I was, once we got her groovin' I swear she was mimicking magical girl transformations. Not that I was any better in the cringe department, one of the songs playing sounded a bit like rythm heaven ringside so my drunk ass struck a pose like the wrestler. Trish thought that was hilarious and started doing it too, shame we were missing a third pillar man. In-between songs I went for another beer but discovered we managed to go through the entire case. while I was shaking cans to see if any had some of the golden nectar remaining, the music shifted tone. The notes were long and slow, a woman sung about love lost and found, I could feel a hand on my shoulder.</p><p>"No proms complete without a slow dance, one more?" Trish pleaded, tugging me back to our makeshift dance floor.</p><p>Trish pressed herself against me and my arm wrapped around her waist unconsciously. Her hand found mine and we began to sway with the music. Her ample chest squished against me as her body molded around mine. In contrast to the calm music I could feel her heart beating rapidly and mine was no better. As we slowly danced throughout the room I realized that the light was playing on the air itself. Wait, was that fog? It was! A wispy layer of fog caressed our feet and tufts rose up to meet us. Following their movement lead my gaze back to the black box, Reed you sly son of a bitch. I swiveled my head to find him but he and Stella mysteriously disappeared, The barest rumble of a car starting could be heard.</p><p>Guess that left me and Trish alone for the night, it had felt that way since 'prom' started anyways. Our song had ended but a new one had begun before we could decouple ourselves. Trish didn't seem to mind much so I didn't see a reason to stop. We danced and swayed among the fog clouds, the lights flickering between them. Trish murmured something I couldn't hear despite the soft music we were listening to.</p><p>"Hm?" I prodded her.</p><p>"Thanks for tonight" she admitted.</p><p>"Why thank me? You were the one who threw the party" I reminded her, Now I was the one who got to give the 'you're dumb' look.</p><p>Trish was silent for a few moments "Yeah, okay. You can thank me now."</p><p>Despite the fact that she was clearly joking I couldn't help myself.</p><p>"Thank you, Trish. For tonight, for everything." I replied earnestly, hugging her a little tighter. I hope she knew I meant it.</p><p>Trish chose not to say anything, instead she intertwined her fingers with mine and rested her head against my shoulder. Our height difference more apparent than ever, I could easily see right over her. Her tail was swaying far too fast for it to be the music, was she actually wagging it? Things slowly started falling into place despite my clouded mind. The handholding, the slow dancing, the tail wagging.</p><p>Did Trish like me?</p><p>So many past events redefined themselves, it had all become so obvious. Yet there was still one question unanswered.</p><p>Did I like Trish?</p><p>She pulled me out of my apathy, she was my partner, she was my coach, she was my friend. Why even ask that? Why wouldn't I like Trish? Almost as if sensing my thoughts she pulled her head off my shoulder. She didn't say anything, her eyes merely gazed into mine. The song ended but as a new one began neither of us moved. The world seemed to have faded away until nothing remained but the woman in front of me. Her gentle breath, the warmth of her bosom, her hand around mine, the faint scent of perspiration mingled with a feminine deodorant, her pleading diamond pupils. A distant voice was calling me from somewhere within my mind, trying to tell me something. My hazy mind just couldn't find it, Lost within her amethyst prisms I couldn't find myself.</p><p>The spell was broken when she slowly, hesitantly, closed her eyes. She tilted her snout upward, lips slightly parted. Trish was so sure, so confident in everything she did but here she was waiting for me. I slowly leaned down to meet her, the difference in height between us making the journey last painfully long. The back of my mind itched again, one final warning that was lost when my lips brushed against hers. All that mattered then was that we were connected, my lips tingled as we experimented with each other. Her shorter snout requiring only a little finesse to get used too. I could feel her horn brushing against my cheek occasionally, smooth and cool against my flush skin.</p><p>"Ow!" I broke off from her on instinct.</p><p>Trish gasped "Sorry! Sorry!" she immediately cupped my face, trying to inspect the damage.</p><p>"I'm fine! I just thought you poked my eye out there" I reassured her, resting my hand over hers.</p><p>We shared a nervous laugh, both of us unsure where to go from here.</p><p>"Try again?" Trish asked, her cheeks tinged with color.</p><p>"You need the practice" I concluded, relishing in the fact that her blush deepened.</p><p>Our next few kisses were tentative and chaste, mindful not to repeat the last incident. With practice came confidence, with confidence came passion and I quickly learned just how passionate Trish truly was. She leapt into my arms and crossed her legs around my waist, unwilling to be even slightly apart. The beads on her jewelry rattling as she kissed me like every moment could be the last. I tried and failed to keep up with her hungry lips, she peppered my jaw and neck with kisses when I was too slow. Dimly I recalled what Trish admitted earlier tonight, she must have been craving intimacy for years. I smiled into her lips, happy to let her vent her frustrations on me.</p><p>"My room-" She moaned "is the last one-" she kissed my cheek "down the hall" she finished, her breath hot and heavy in my ear.</p><p>The room was dark, the furniture was cluttered and I had a hornier than usual triceratops in my arms. I slowly made my way down the hall but drunk as I was managed to lose balance. Accidentally slamming Trish into the wall didn't seem to hurt her so when she gasped at the impact I took full advantage of her exposed neck. She cradled my head and moaned, urging me to continue ravishing incredibly fine scales there. Unable to control a primal urge within me I bit down hard enough to leave an imprint of my teeth in her flesh. She gasped, impossibly it felt like her grip tightened in response to me. I kissed her new mark and my lips traveled back to hers, I could feel a damp spot growing where her legs wrapped around my waist.</p><p>Newly inspired to take my conquest to the proper breeding ground I reluctantly pulled off the wall and continued on to her room. Pushing open the door we nearly tumbled to the floor, the look she gave me when I dropped her on the bed told me I was going to fuck this dinosaur. Momentarily free of Trish I started stripping my clothes, damned vest, why did I have to wear layers? Trish watched me hungrily as more and more of my clothes found their way to the floor. Crawling onto the bed and between Trish's thighs our lips were reunited once again. I could feel her breasts brushing against me with her heavy breaths, they had teased me long enough. Grabbing the hem of her top I yanked it down, at long last freeing her expansive chest. The sheer fabric that still covered her breasts did nothing to preserve her modesty, the sight left me painfully hard. Taking a diamond-hard nipple into my mouth I grinded my length against her, neither of us able to contain our moans. Her lacy black panties were utterly soaked and her tiny prom dress had scrunched up around her waist, giving me full access.</p><p>I trailed butterfly kisses from her breast, down her stomach, to her womb, and finally on her panties. Trish gasped and squeezed her powerful thighs around my head at the sensation. I slowly peeled her underwear down her thighs, the material sticky with her juices. Doing so exposed her arousal to the air and left my head swimming. I didn't have it in me for any more foreplay, my body was screaming at me to let nature take its course. Positioning myself at her entrance I looked at Trish for confirmation, the brief reprieve seemed to give her a moment of clarity. She reached over to her dresser, fumbling a bit until she pulled out a condom. Normally I'd question why she had that but normally I wasn't sharing a bed with a naked woman. Tearing the package and awkwardly covering my tool I bent over her and placed a gentle kiss on her lips.</p><p>"Ready?" I asked breathily.</p><p>"Mhm" came her nervous reply.</p><p>As I entered her for the first time. Her tightness seemed simultaneously welcoming and resistant, I groaned as I slowly sunk my length into her. Watching her face switch from apprehension to pleasure as I bottomed out inside her felt as good as actually hilting her. I paused a moment, both to let her adjust and to give me a moment to try and cool down despite her sweltering insides. When she nodded I pulled out and thrusted against her in one motion, the sensation sent my head spinning. Trish gasped when I did, arching her back off the bed as her body practically begged for my touch. I thrust into her purposefully, grinding my length inside her to reach her deepest depths. Each time my hips met hers she would moan my name. Bottoming out inside her I paused just long enough to place a kiss on one of her breasts. That was all the time she needed.</p><p>Her hands that were gripping the bedsheet found my shoulders and I suddenly found myself beneath her. Her eyes were aflame with a hunger that was focused entirely on me. She sat up, putting her breasts on full display and letting my member slide out of her. She immediately sat back down, grinding her slick entrance up and down my length.</p><p>"T-Trish?" I gasped at the sensation.</p><p>Trish leaned down with a predatory smile, her breath smelled of cheap beer and I could feel her lips brushing against my ears.</p><p>"Call me mommy." Arousal was dripping from her voice.</p><p>She started rolling her hips back and forth, Any thought but thrusting back against her was lost to me. Trish smirked and picked up the pace, her breasts bouncing with the rhythm. I bit my lip, willing myself to hold on just a little longer but with Trish controlling the tempo it was impossible.</p><p>"I'm about to-" I moaned</p><p>She immediately grabbed my cock and slid it inside her. Her hips never stopped bouncing, the lewd sounds of flesh clapping and the sudden tightness were too much for me. My world exploded and left me numb to everything but the woman spasming on top of me. Coming down from my high I saw a self satisfied smile on Trish's face. I think she came just from the idea of being cummed inside. We held each other, basking in our afterglow while reality slowly reasserted itself.</p><p>"I needed that" Trish sighed happily.</p><p>I think I did too, I was feeling refreshed and... Really tired.</p><p>"I kind of want a cigarette, you see it in the movies all the time" I admitted.</p><p>"Not in the house" Trish scoffed.</p><p>"Yes, mommy" I couldn't help but snicker as her eyes widened.</p><p>"Not a word of that to anyone"</p><p>The world had started spinning, the alcohol was catching up with me. I just answered her with a smooch on the snout, right below the horn. Her face scrunched up but she giggled and planted a wet return kiss on my nose. Her bed was so much softer than it had any right to be, It was getting harder and harder to keep my eyes open. I could hear the rustling of fabric as Trish wagged her tail, I thought about teasing her but yawned instead. Taking a deep breath the days events seemed to sink in, so much had changed today hadn't it? Closing my eyes and letting sleep take me, I rested easy knowing it was finally over.</p><p>Bzzt</p><p>I barely cracked my eye open, the eyelid far too heavy. Who the hell was calling me at this hour? I wasn't even sober yet. Carefully extracting myself from Trish's grip without waking her I scrambled for the phone before THAT woke her. Fumbling about in the dark for my slacks I eventually followed the buzzing and turned on the phone. It was 2AM, did Stella leave something behind? I tapped open my messages and it felt like a jolt of electricity lanced my heart and raced up my spine. I wasn't feeling tired anymore.</p><p>Fang: I'm here.</p></div>
