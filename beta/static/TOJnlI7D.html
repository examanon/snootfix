                    <p>Title: I Missed You So Much</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot </p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>   Anon tossed and turned in his bed. It had been a year since the shooting, and every day he had withdrawn even further into his little world. His pity party. He felt awful every waking second of the day, often taking sleeping pills to get through it for just a few hours at a time. He wished he could go back and change things, but he knew such wishing was pointless. He only longed for death now, but he knew he couldn’t bring himself to end it all. He ate like shit and he knew it, rarely going out to eat. He had all but wasted away to a skeleton by this point, malnutrition setting in. On occasion he found himself back home with a box of dinosaur-shaped nuggets. He would take a bite or two and, tasting the warm chicken in on his tongue, begin to cry as the memories flooded through his mind like a tidal wave.</p><p>  </p><p>   As the leaves turned darker and the wind became colder he became more withdrawn. Soon he did nothing more than lay in his bed, swaddled in his bedsheets. Ignoring the piling bills that collected by the door flap. He thought of almost nothing anymore, just a lifeless husk. He looked out the window and saw a dozen children walking along the streets, costumed up. They approached houses across the way, the porches full of pumpkins carved with various faces. The orange light of the candles inside casting ghoulish faces on the walls and streets. He watched listlessly for a while. The children must be enjoying themselves.</p><p>   </p><p>   He downed his daily ration of sleep aid for the third time that day and fell into a fitful sleep, kicking the covers every which way. He had nightmares of the incident. Of the bodies he saw. Of the one that he couldn’t save, despite his best efforts. He cried through his dreams to the waking world, a pitiful noise like that of a child having a bad dream. He woke with a start, sweat dripping from his body and stink clinging to him like a disease. He looked around the darkened room, at the infinite abyss of shadow that obscured the otherwise visible details and furniture. The shadows began to dance, frolicking and warping in their macabre show. He swore he saw something move. Rubbing his eyes, he peered further into the darkness.</p><p> </p><p>   He almost jumped three feet in the air when he heard the crash. Something bumped against the wall.</p><p>He waited for a second, heart beating a mile a minute. Waiting with breath held to see if it would repeat itself. Another crash. Closer. He pulled the sheets up further, as if they would shield him from whatever it was. He began to make out a shape not unlike a human. In the bare light he could tell it was far wider. It slowly moved forward, the dim moonlight pouring through the window highlighting it only a little. A face missing an eye, in its place a black empty socket. A hole where the nose would’ve been. An amber eye, glittering like a jewel. His heart stopped as he peered into the one good eye.</p><p>   The apparition moved closer, fully within the moonbeams. No doubt about it, there was Fang. Sans a few swathes of skin and facial features, of course, but it was still the pterodactyl who had been dead. She shuffled closer, bone sticking out of her arm. Brownish blood dripped slowly from the wound, as well as cuts and lacerations in numerous other places. Her head lolled as if it were broken. She kept coming closer. Her clawed hand stretched out, swiping the air as she got closer. A guttural growl came, giving hint to her intent. Anon scrambled backwards a few inches in the bed, coming up against the headboard. He pleaded with her, apologizing and begging. He was sorry. He was so sorry. If only, if only.</p><p>   Nonplussed, the zombified Fang kept moving towards him, rage flaring in her eye. Anon looked around his bed and nightstand for something to defend himself. His eyes came across the plate of dinosaur nuggets he had attempted – and failed – to eat earlier that day. He closed his eyes and murmured a quick prayer to whoever would listen, and thrust the plate in front of him. Fang stopped in her tracks, snout lifting into the air and sniffing questioningly. Her eye came to rest on what he was offering. She blinked for a moment before dropping her hand. Her growling stopped. Anon's eyes peeked open when he realized he hadn't been torn to shreds. Glancing nervously at the undead girl in front of him, he could swear he saw her tail wagging. She leapt forwards startling him enough to drop the plate; stale nuggets scattered across his lap.</p><p>She embraced him in a hug, squeezing him tightly. A few bits of bone jabbed his side, but it Anon could barely feel it. His arms came to rest around her decayed body, and his head came to rest on her shoulder. He cried, shuddering sobs wracking his body. He missed her so much.</p>
