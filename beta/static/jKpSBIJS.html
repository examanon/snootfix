<h1>The GVH Room Chapter 1</h1><div><p>It was another boring day at high school, spring was in full bloom, and the daily slog of dealing with people I wanted nothing to do with continued on.</p><p>​</p><p>Well, there's some people I want to deal with, at least, my cute ptero of a girlfriend comes to mind. </p><p>Fang.</p><p>Out of all the people at this school that come to mind, she's the one person I wouldn't trade for anything else. If I had a chance to go back in time and fix what went down at Rock Bottom, I would do it all again just so I could see her.</p><p>Of course, knowing this, Fang uses it to her advantage by turning me into VVURM DRAMA'S impromptu roadie. Reed lent one of his drums to the GVH room at school, a part of the school I've literally never heard about till now. </p><p>It's located in that weird end of the building by the back exit. None of my classes this semester were anywhere near it, so I can't say that I've made myself familiar with that area. Either way, can't let Fang down so just gotta push through it.</p><p>As I approached the entrance of my destination, I saw some dumbass left the doo to the outdoor entrance open, leading all manner of insects to fly into the building like flies to a turd (lol)</p><p>Now that I'm here, I notice just how big this room is. It's larger than any other classroom I've seen in this school. I'm pretty sure the Teacher's lounge isn't as massive as this. I also glance through one of the windows and notice various objects, a fridge, a cooking area, an exercise ball, wait…</p><p>I take a moment to read the sign next to the door to confirm my suspicions.</p><p>Room: 132 (The GVH Room)</p><p>Volcano High's Special Ed Class.</p><p>Oh no…</p><p>Well… I mean, at least Reed was kind enough to lend one of his drums for these guys to use, but I'm not really sure what kind of conditions he's expecting to get it back in? Well, time waits for no one.</p><p>I open the door to the classroom, and the first thing I'm greeted with is… Wait, Trish??</p><p>“HAAAAAAAAA, BUG!!!!!” What I assume to be Trish screams in my face and pulls me into the classroom</p><p>Now that I'm deaf, I don't have to listen to her anymore.</p><p>She pulls me into the classroom with the strength of a thousand tards.</p><p>Although this person looks like Trish, triceratops, same clothing, same skin tone, but somethings off about her... </p><p>I study her face and see her smushed features, the crest on her head looking as if it's about to fall off, along with the drool pouring from her mouth. When did Trish develop fetal alcohol syndrome??</p><p>Additionally, Trish is short but not as short as whatever the hell is standing in front of me. The last time I checked, Trish isn't 4'8.</p><p>"I LIEK TO PLAY DA BASS" 'Trish' screeches with enthusiasm. </p><p>Well, at least something matches.</p><p>"Uhhhh, that's nice…. Trish?"</p><p>"TRISH???? MY NAME TROSH YOU STOOPID POOPY FACE!" Trosh yells in my face, spittle flying onto my shirt as she sprays her words.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>Suddenly Trosh's face lights up as she notices a mosquito flying in front of my face.</p><p>"AHHHHHHH HAHAHAHAHAHA" She points giddily, "BUG! NEW FWIEND!"</p><p>Jesus, fuck, these things were bad enough back in rock bottom. Instinctively I swat the mosquito, also smacking myself in the process. Maybe I'm in the wrong classroom.</p><p>That apparently was a mistake..</p><p> Trosh's bubbly demeanor turns sour as her face contorts and lets out a low pitch wail as the tears begin to well in her eyes. </p><p>"Uhhh…." The only word I can muster out, trying to think of how to comfort Trish's slow doppelganger.</p><p>Suddenly, Trosh begins to boil with anger, damn what do I say?</p><p>"I'm uhhh… sorry Trosh-" I attempt to apologize before I'm cut off with her raised finger.</p><p>"Y-Y-YOU KILL THE BUG!! DEBUUBI GERBEEF ABBJYL SDAJF LDF SKINNIE DIGABEEBBOOP!” The diminutive triceratops screeches before her words devolve into a litany of incomprehensible babbling.</p><p>As her tardy tirade towards me continues, my attention is pulled away by the thundering footsteps that approach from my rear.</p><p>THUD, THUD, THUD, THUD, THUD, THUD</p><p>"WHO YOU?" A deep and powerful voice bellows from behind me, prompting me to turn around and see… Wait, what the fuck??</p><p>I turn to see an absolute wall of a girl who easily towers over me, carrying a hammer and a drumset in both hands, sporting a similar attire to... Wait... </p><p>Stella?</p><p>"NO! AM STONK!" Her broken English echoes throughout the room like an earthquake.</p><p>I didn't know I could go deaf twice. </p><p>"YOU HERE FOR DRUM?" Stonk blasts my eardrums inquisitively </p><p>"Uh- Y-yeah." I choke out, still in shock with everything I've witnessed right now, from Trish's bug-eyed doppelganger to Stella who apparently took up a job as a Reddit moderator. </p><p>"HERE YOU GO" Stella's boisterous twin chirps while practically shoving the drum into my arms.</p><p>Before I take the drums, my hands pause when I notice a gaping hole in the set, along with the remains of the head being covered in stains. </p><p>"Uhhh… Stonk? What's this?"</p><p>Stonk responds to my question by continuing to shove the drum directly into my arms with tremendous force.</p><p>"IT DRUM"</p><p>I hold the drum and inspect the damage, careful to avoid touching whatever the wet stuff might be… It's completely ruined, fuck what am I gonna tell Reed?</p><p>Noticing the hammer in her other hand, it's not hard to put two and two together and figure out what happened to the drumset. But out of curiosity's sake… </p><p>"N-no Ste- I mean Stonk, what happened to the drum?" I inquire from the jolly green tard, who responds by continuing to pierce my soul with that blank stare.</p><p>…</p><p>"IT DRUM."</p><p>So this is why you don't invest all your points into strength, huh?</p><p>Stonk's iron stare is finally broken where her head jerks over to her left to see Trosh laying on the floor sobbing. Raptor Jesus, I didn't even know she was still there.</p><p>"WHAT WRONG TROSH?" The giga stego hollers to the sorrowful triceratard on the ground.</p><p>“GEBEBEFJLKL H-HE KILL THE BUG JEEBIZFLEEFORFP” W-what..</p><p>Before I can comprehend whatever the fuck just came out of her mouth, Stonk's head jerks right back towards me with a rage that stops me in my tracks.</p><p>And with one hand, she picks me up by the collar of the shirt and lifts me off the fucking ground.</p><p>"YOU MAKE TROSH CRY?!?!" This goliath of a girl roars in my face as she restrains me with an iron grip.</p><p>"I-I didn't mean to! I t-thought it was a wasp" I try to bullshit my way out of her grip. I don't feel like getting a broken neck today.</p><p>The wrathful look on Stonk's face hardens as her body winds up, oh no…</p><p>And with a swift motion, the giant stego literally tosses me out of the classroom, sending me across the floors of the school hallway, with the drumset falling out my arms and clattering against the ground.</p><p>As if my body couldn't be in any more pain, my eardrums nearly burst from the sound of Stonk slamming the door, almost breaking it off the hinges.</p><p>Fuuuuuuuuuccckkkk…. Nothing seems broken, other than my dignity. I don't even bother looking at the drumset, knowing full well it was broken the moment I set foot in that classroom.</p><p>"Need a hand, dweeb?" a familiar voice calls from behind.</p><p>I look behind me and see none other than Fang, attempting to hold her laughter with all of her strength.</p><p>"Please tell me you didn't see all of that..."</p><p>"Oh, I did, and I gotta say it was pretty sad." Fang smugly responds as she loses her composure and bursts into laughter.</p><p>"PFFFT HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"</p><p>"Yeah… Fuck you too." I groan as I lift myself off the ground and examine the remains of the drum set. </p><p>"Sorry about the drums, though... Big Bitch Stella over there thought that a hammer would work as a drumstick"</p><p>Fang stops her laughter as her eyes meet the destroyed drums on the ground.</p><p>"Ehh, it's alright. He could probably use the parts for something else." Fang shrugs. "Besides, it's not his only kit.</p><p>Task... failed successfully?</p><p>"Pffft, yeah, exactly Dweeb," Fang responds to my mumbling as we both pick up the remains of the ruined drumset.</p><p>"So what did you mean by 'Big Bitch Stella?'"</p><p>I let out a sigh…</p><p>"Before I start, let's just probably not mention this to Stella.. Or Trish for that matter."</p></div>
