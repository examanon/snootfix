                    <p>Title: A Special Surprise</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Trish, Reed, Stella, Rosa</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>post ending 4 marriage</p><p>|\/|</p><p>Another tiring day at work,I pull up to our little home that Fang and I where able to buy with our hard earned money, with the "help" of ridley of course.</p><p>Its not perfect by any means, it definitely has its flaws,exterior paint needs to be redone, fence needs to be rebuilt properly, and the lawn has seen better days for sure but id rather be out here than living in that shit hole that is skinrow.</p><p>I fish the keys out of my pocket and insert them to the door, giving it a gentle push as i make my way trough the noisy door,giving it another gentle push to close it as i hit the light switch, and in that instant</p><p>Fang,Trish,Stella,Rosa,Reed:"Surprise!"</p><p>In that moment i just stood there looking utterly dumfounded, words escaping my mouth,Confetti raining down on me.</p><p>Fang:"Happy birthday Anon!"</p><p>Trish:"Happy birthday you monkey!"</p><p>Rosa:"Feliz cumpleaños An-on!"</p><p>Reed:"happy birthday bro~"</p><p>Stella:"A happy birthday to you anon!"</p><p>Anon:"wh-wha? me?"</p><p>nice going anon</p><p>Fang:"Well,yeah who else idiot" a small chuckle escaping her</p><p>Trish:"Fang mentioned that you've never celebrated a birthday before,sooo we thought 'why not throw one for him'?" she said as a small smile brewed on her face</p><p>Rosa and stella pull fang to the side and whisper to each other, fang giving a nod to both of them as they take a turn into the kitchen.</p><p>Curiosity waves over to me, as I'm about to start making my way to the kitchen I am stalled by a mildly toxic puff of smoke,halting me on my tracks as I start coughing, I look over to see the pink velociraptor with his 'science equipment'.</p><p>Reed:"whoops my bad amigo, didn't see you there"</p><p>of course you didn't</p><p>Trish:"Reed! we went over this! you cant be doing that here! fangs parents drop by every once in a while you know that!</p><p>Reed:"trish its fine, it hardly leaves an odor right anon?" he remarked,giving me a small wink </p><p>Anon:"Riiiiight" my words having absolutely next to no confidence as i imagine the potential devastation fangs dad would impose onto me</p><p>Reed:"Still bro i cant believe you've never celebrated your birthday before"</p><p>Trish:"Yeeeah, i thought you sknnies celebrated that like a ritual or something, whats up with that anon?" curiosity waning in on her eyes</p><p>Anon:"well i never really bothered with that stuff you know? I always thought it was a waste of time, having to deal with setting up everything and inviting people."</p><p>Trish:"is that so?" she questioned, clearly not satisfied with my answer</p><p>Reed:"dude,you missed out on the chance to get a whole bunch of freebies"</p><p>Anon"yeah, maybe youre right." i sigh</p><p>Trish:"well what matters is that you're celebrating it now with us, right? No point in getting all gloomy over something that happened in the past!" she exclaimed, as she gave me a nudge with her elbow</p><p>I only shoot her a smile in return</p><p>Our chatter is interrupted by stella calling out to us to come into the kitchen,i know whats coming but i cant help but feel nervous about it, maybe because Ive never experienced something like this before in my life.</p><p>As i walk in im presented with an enormous cake enough to feed atleast 15 guest with a pterodactyl and a skinnie serving as the candles and a lone chair reserved for you're s truly</p><p>Rosa:"quickly anon! sit sit!!"  practically yelling as she guided me to the chair</p><p>The lights were dimmed until the only visible object in the room was the cake and anon, Everyone gathered around and sang a happy birthday to you.</p><p>Despite it being a bit embarrassing, it felt nice knowing you had people in you're life that care about you enough to do something like this.</p><p>One happy birthday song later and then came the birthday bite, you give one last look to every one before chomping down on the sugary goodness that awaits you.</p><p>As you start reaching down you see rosa out of the corner of you're eye and immediately know whats coming, she grabs your head and slams it down on the cake, had you not had the endurance of a brick wall, this would have surely landed you in the hospital</p><p>You lift you're head,dazed and hurting, to see that nearly half of the cake was destroyed upon impact of your face,guess that's why they got a cake that big in the first place.</p><p>they take turns congratulating me and handing the birthday gifts, Trish's gift was a nicely made bathroom robe, reeds was a rather decent looking vr headset along with a game,Stella's gift was a collection of anime DVD's that had some very questionable front covers, i glanced at her and she gave me the double thumbs up, cant be that bad can it? Rosa's was arguable the most impressive, a hand made quilt that had little anons and little fangs all over it.</p><p>The hours passed by like minutes as we all gathered to chat and eat whatever was left of the cake.</p><p>Eventually came the time for everyone to head they're own separate ways until it was just me and my beloved fang.</p><p>Fang:"So how was it?"</p><p>Anon:"How was what?"</p><p>Fang:"you're birthday party dummy" </p><p>Anon:"Oh! it was great!I hadn't had that much fun a while ever since we bought this house."</p><p>Fang:"you knoow~   i still havent given you your birthday present" her words carrying an enamorous tone to it</p><p>Anon:"oh?" i curiously say as i pull fang closer to me</p><p>Fang giggles, then pushes me away, taking my hand and gently placing it on her stomach, we both lock on to each others eyes knowing full well of what it meant.</p><p>Anon:"Fang......" the words leave me as ive been struck by a train</p><p>Fang:"Happy birthday anon...this is my gift to you, our own little bundle of joy"</p><p>In that moment i felt nothing but Happiness and attachment to fang,i pulled her in, embracing her, relishing and savoring the moment, wishing time would halt to a complete stop.Tears of joy rolling down each others cheek, we we're finally going to start the loving family we've dreamed about all this time, and what better way to do it with the person who i so very dearly love.</p>
