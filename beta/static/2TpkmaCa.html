                    <p>Title: Fang And Anon's Text-uality</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Reed</p><p>Rating: NSFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>Fang and Anon's Text-uality</p><p>The halls are packed today as I make my way to my first period, keeping my eyes down. The events of the auditorium are still fresher in people’s minds than I would like it to be, even no at the end of March. Fang is usually around to give me some backup (you wouldn’t believe what a well-timed hiss from an angry ptero-GF can do to a snide comment), but she’s busy today with a project for another class, leaving me to fend for myself. We’ve been dating for almost a month now, our relationship really heating up since she spent those fateful days in my apartment. Things between Fang and Trish are still tense; Trish just can’t take a hint to leave Fang alone, and every time I bring it up to Fang, she tries changing the subject, usually in dramatic and… suggestive ways. Still, all things considered things are looking up, and as I slip into Mr. Carleciidewski’s classroom my phone buzzes, Fang’s texts a welcome balm to sooth my worried soul.</p><p>Fang: hey</p><p>Anon: hey :P</p><p>Fang: so we didn’t get to spend much time together last night lol</p><p>Anon: well your dad makes it pretty hard too, with all the wanting to murder me and stuff.</p><p>Fang: lol, you’re getting pretty quick at leaping out my window :V</p><p>Fang: hands still burned?</p><p>Chuckling, I absently run my fingers across my palm, the red welts still slightly painful. Anything would be worth the time I get to spend with Fang, but that bedsheet rope has been killer.</p><p>Anon: not too bad now</p><p>An ellipse from Fang lets me know she’s writing something a little longer in response. Each time I shimmy out of her window, hearing her dad storm up the stairs like an avalanche, Fang always greets me the next morning at school with a consoling kiss on each palm, her amber eyes lowered seductively. I missed those kisses because of her stupid project today, just my luck to be snoot-blocked by freakin’ schoolwork. </p><p>Fang: good you need those hands to help me in science and stuff lol :V you sittin in the back? can’t let anyone peek lol</p><p>Glancing at the clock, it’s still a few minutes until the period starts. Most of the class has arrived, assembled in the desks in front of me. Reed gives me a little nod as he takes his seat near the front, his purple partner is crime mercifully absent once again. My reputation as a weeb hasn’t done me any favors, and I’ve taken refuge at the back of the class, thankful that Reed has given me some space. He tried sticking up for me when the class started targeting me, but I grew tired of the walled up balls of paper and other school supply detritus that was getting lobbed at my head. I was safer at the back now.</p><p>Anon: nope I’m pretty much a leaper now.</p><p>Fang: good <:V</p><p>Fang: ur hands r probably too sore to jerk it, huh? :V</p><p>I can feel myself twitch as I read Fang’s text. She’s usually pretty playful when we fool around, but outside of making out in her bedroom we haven’t done anything serious. Even though I know no one would bother looking my way twice, I shoot a quick glance to either side to make sure I’m free from prying eyes.</p><p>Anon: yeah lol</p><p>Anon: been having to use a pasta claw lately</p><p>Anon: feel like uncle Moe lol</p><p>Fang: gross lol don’t make me think of that</p><p>Fang: maybe your girlfriend can help you out tonight :V</p><p>I can feel the beginnings of a blush spread across my face. Leaning back, I tuck my phone beneath the desk, adding a little extra protection against any roving eyes. </p><p>Anon: i dunno, what about those claws? :P</p><p>Fang: oh i can be real gentle</p><p>Fang: or maybe you want a claw-job huh? :V</p><p>Fang: never pegged you as a dino-fetishist. Gonna ask me to jerk you with my tail? Too short for that lol :V</p><p>I subtly shift in my chair, hoping to hide my quickly-hardening member from the rest of the class. I’m already a weeb-pariah, I don’t need to be known as the guy who gets boners in class too. </p><p>Anon: maybe just the hands for now ;)</p><p>Fang: hmmm okay, I can do that</p><p>Fang: draw you up to my room, maybe shove a sweatshirt under the door so no one can hear ;V</p><p>Fang: undo your belt, maybe just tear it off lol</p><p>Fang: you’re probably pitching a tent just picturing it huh?</p><p>She knows me too well. </p><p>Anon: maybe ;)</p><p>Fang: good ;V</p><p>Fang: I like making your dick hard</p><p>Fang: you know I can feel it when we make out right? Lol :V</p><p>Fang: pretty sexy thinking how big you are</p><p>Fang: makes me just wanna reach down and wrap my hands around that shaft</p><p>Fang: ur skin is soft against my scales as I work my hand up and down</p><p>Fang: givin u kisses on the neck as I jerk you off :V</p><p>More students filter into the classroom now, an orange triceratops girl with glasses reluctantly taking an open spot in my row. Even though she’s as far as she can get from me, I still surreptitiously tilt the screen away from her. </p><p>Fang: fuck this is makin me wet lol ;V</p><p>Fang: 1 sec</p><p>A minute or two passes before Fang writes again, the period bell ringing loudly. Mr. Carlekidiwsky doesn’t seem to notice, his head still laid back, faint snores emanating from the dirty magazine draped haphazardly over his face. My phone buzzes once more, the message taking a little while to pop up. It’s a selfie of Fang, seated in a bathroom stall. My eyes widen as I realize her pants are open, one hand thrust in her panties, the other held out to take the snapshot. Only her snoot is visible, but I can still see the wicked grin on her face.</p><p>Fang: might have been helping myself out too lol :V</p><p>Anon: :O</p><p>Fang: you n’ me tonight, ok?</p><p>Anon: sure ;)</p><p>Fang: good lol, gonna make you squirt like I did ;V</p><p>Fang: oh, one more thing:</p><p>Fang’s next message takes a while to arrive, the tardy bell finally kicking Mr. Carlikediwssky out of his slumber.</p><p>Fang: parents gonna be out of town tonight, some lame church thing, and Naser’s got a track meet <;V</p><p>Fang: so maybe we do a little more than just jerking you off</p><p>Fang: okay?</p><p>At this point, my boner has assumed direct control of my body. Before I can type out my reply to Fang, though, the last thing I ever needed to hear shocks me out of my hormone-addled stupor. </p><p>“Alright you freakin’ kids settle down! We’ve got some freakin’ hard problems today and I need some freakin’ volunteers to come up and solve ‘em! Anon, get your freakin’ butt up here and do this first one okay?”</p><p>Well, my reputation couldn’t get any worse.</p>
