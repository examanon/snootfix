No, Anon, I wasn't talking about Mr Jingo. What were you staring at, anyways?"</p><p>>Oh dear God, the glare intensifies. </p><p>>"Jeez, Fang, I was just looking for the others. Can't you get off my case?"</p><p>>Suddenly the anger in her face is gone, replaced with something that looks a whole lot more like sadness </p><p>>"Alright."</p><p>>with that, she grabs her tray, stands up and makes for the exit.</p><p>>I jump to my feet as well, but Fang has already disappeared through the cafeteria door.</p><p>>"Hey Anon," I hear Reed's voice behind me.</p><p>>"Should we give you some space?"</p><p>>"I just don't get it," I tell Reed as we make our way through the overgrown hallways of Volcano High, Trish having split from us a bit earlier to go to the Bathroom.</p><p>>probably for the best, the way she's been staring daggers at me all throughout the lunchbreak.</p><p>>"She's been just so moody lately. One minute she's having a great day, the next it's as if I've rained on her parade somehow. I keep racking my head, but I just can't figure out what I've done wrong."</p><p>>"And have you tried asking her what's wrong, dude?"</p><p>>"Of course I did! On a daily basis. But she keeps brushing off the question. I am at my wit's end here."</p><p>>well, not quite.</p><p>>seems like there is at least one neuron that is still fighting the good fight, because I have an idea.</p><p>>"Reed? Don't take this the wrong way, but you are basically a girl now, right? Do you- Do you think Fang could be on the rag? Do you think tha- Ow!"</p><p>>Reed's jab hurts even more than Fang's did.</p><p>>"Damn, dude."</p><p>>Reed shakes he- his head.</p><p>>"Please stop embarrassing yourself, bro. Hell, you're embarrassing ME, and I am the one who plays the school mascot on the reg."</p><p>>I am still half doubled over, my left hand clutching my certainly bruised ribs, but I manage to raise the right one in an apologetic gesture. </p><p>>"Alright," I wheeze, "I am sorry for calling you a girl, man. Won't happen again."</p><p>>Reed looks at me as if he is questioning my sanity, dragging his hands through his mane.</p><p>>"Don't make me hit you again, bro," he mutters, more to himself than for my benefit.</p><p>>a long suffering sigh follows.</p><p>>"Anon, this isn't about what you called me, alright. I couldn't care less, dude. This is about you being denser than a fucking neutron star."</p><p>>I am pulling myself back up in a somewhat more upright postion, using the locker beides me to lean on.</p><p>>"I am not sure I follow."</p><p>> a loud bang makes me twitch.</p><p>>Reed has slammed his arms against the locker to my left and right, blocking my escape routes.</p><p>>"Let me help you jog your memory, bro," he says, leaning in.</p><p>>though this up close, the "he" feels even less appropiate than before.</p><p>>for God's sake, Reed's breasts are almost pressed against my chest.</p><p>>it could be a moment straight out of my japanese doujins if there weren't a few little problems. </p><p>>for one, I have a girlfriend.</p><p>>one I intend to stay fatithful to.</p><p>>and secondly, being cornered by a pissed off raptor like this would probably ruin anybody's mood.</p><p>>well, perhaps not anybody's.</p><p>>there's a lot of weird fucks out there.</p><p>>but I sure as hell do not belong to them.</p><p>>you want proof? </p><p>>try my genitals, which are currently trying to escape back inside my body.</p><p>>silly dick, that little muscle and fat tissue won't protect you from a raptor's claw. </p><p>>tok, tok, tok.</p><p>>"Hello, earth to anon? You there, bro?"</p><p>>"Y-Yeah, I am awake. Fine and dandy."</p><p>>I rub my forehead, where Reed's tapping knuckles found a way to get me back to the present.</p><p>>"Then perhaps start listening," Reed says, even her (her? Fuck it, her) usual calm and relaxed manner giving way to exasperation. </p><p>>"When would you say Fang's mood swings started?"</p><p>>That's a good question.</p><p>>it feels like our relationship has been soured by them for a long time, even if it logically couldn't have been more than a few weeks.</p><p>>in fact, the first incident that comes to mind must've been just about a month ago.</p><p>>Fang had wanted to take me to a new music store downtown to check out their selection.</p><p>>but then I offhandedly mentioned wanting to hit up a sports shop on the way back to look for some new sneakers for gym class.</p><p>>Reed had told me that there were some affordable ones on sale, and I really could've used some new ones to replace the ragged, musky scraps that I had worn for the better part of the last 4 years.</p><p>>as soon as I'd said my piece, Fang began making up transparent excuses not to go.</p><p>>I'd even offered to do the shoe shopping another time, but the damage had been done.</p><p>>Fang had asked me to leave and probably spent the rest of the day sulking in her room with a bag of dino tendies, while I had done my best to stealthily exfiltrate her parents' house, praying that her father wouldn't connect his daughter's bad mood to me.</p><p>>Reed nods.</p><p>>"And what else happened right around that time?"</p><p>>hmyea, what did?</p><p>>can't say I remember a whole lot of things that stand out.</p><p>>in fact, the last month had been the most "normal" month I've had since I transferred to Volcano High.</p><p>>except for the fact that Reed had started the hormone shit.</p><p>>but that must've been about two weeks before Fang's issues started.</p><p>>the effects the compound had l</p><p>on Reed's body had already been impossible to deny by the time we had planned our trip downtown.</p><p>>something clicks inside my head.</p><p>>I had mentioned that Reed had tipped me off on the sale and Fang hadn't wanted to go anymore.</p><p>>and now that I think about it:</p><p>>that time we had wanted to go the cinema.</p><p>>Fang had talked about bringing Trish along.</p><p>>I jokingly offered to invite Reed, and the plan had been dead in the water. </p><p>>that other time she seethed at me after I told her we could spend an afternoon doing nothing, because I'd copy the homework from Reed.</p><p>>Reed, Reed, Reed.</p><p>>connecting every single one of her little episodes. </p><p>>but why?</p><p>>looking back, it's almost as if she didn't like me spending time with Reed.</p><p>>but weren't they friends as well?</p><p>>bandmates, even.</p><p>>while Reed and I were simply bros.</p><p>>but honestly, looking at Reed now, I have to admit it:</p><p>>Reed simply doesn't quite qualify for the label of bro anymore </p><p>>with a groan of frustration I bang the back of my head against the locker </p><p>>of course she's jealous. </p><p>>time to fix this.</p><p>>"Fuckin' finally!" Reed cheers, pushing herself away from the lockers and opening the way.</p><p>>did I mumble to myself again, or did she read my mind?</p><p>>if anyone has opened their third eye, it must be Reed.</p><p>>on the other hand, you could probably tell where my thoughts had gone from facial expressions alone. </p><p>>not that it matters how Reed knows my conclusions </p><p>>all that matters right now is that she lets me go and try to save my relationship.</p><p>>Reed is hot on my heels as I rush through the corridors of Volcano high, dodging and weaving past the other students milling about.</p><p>>Fang should be on her way to her English class, so if I manage to catch her on her way there, I should be able to explain the situation to her and make my apology just in time to leave us with a harmonious afternoon. </p><p>>just one more corner and-</p><p>>and nothing.</p><p>>the hallway in front of the classroom is almost empty, the few students lounging about are a far cry from the loud masses that usually form before a lesson begins. </p><p>>a piece of paper bearing the school's letterhead is haphazardly taped to the door.</p><p>>I rip it off.</p><p>>Reed picks this moment to catch up with me.</p><p>>"Jeez Anon, you could've waited for me, bro."</p><p>>the tip of her snout appears in my peripheral vision as she peers over my shoulder.</p><p>>"What's that? Oh man, class is cancelled? Dude, I tell you, some people have all the luck."</p><p>>I don't even react to her comment. </p><p>>my brain is too busy making use of this new information to figure out a plan of action. </p><p>>where would a morose Fang go?</p><p>>the first thing that comes to mind is the roof.</p><p>>but that's not an option. </p><p>>Spear has made it a point to keep the roof access chained shut until the suicide fence has been repaired.</p><p>>something about keeping students from doing things everyone involved would regret or something to that effect.</p><p>>so what does that leave me with?</p><p>>dino-moe's seems like a likely alternative, but gets dismissed on a second thought. </p><p>>from the way the old rex had acted when I first met him he definitely didn't seem like Fang's first choice for comfort.</p><p>>his little Lucy.</p><p>>heh. </p><p>>God, I really do love her.</p><p>>and if that means that I'll have to risk losing my life at the only place I'll likely find her, so be it.</p><p>>I'll brave the golf club once more.</p><p>>"So, Reed," I ask, "you here by car today?"</p><p>>for a moment she seems bewildered by the question.</p><p>>"Yeah, like always. I need the trunk, right?"</p><p>>as if I could forget the bottomless stash of illicit substances that is Reed's trunk. </p><p>>"Right. Can you do me a favor and drop me off at Fang's? Like, right now?"</p><p>>her eyes light up and a thin smile creeps its way up her snout.</p><p>>"So we're ditching?"</p><p>>"Fuck yeah we are."</p><p>>Reed snickers. </p><p>>"Fang's right, dude," she says, "you really are a dweeb."</p><p>>"Hey Anon, getting it on with the new girl already?"</p><p>>I ignore the shouted comment and jump in the passenger seat of Reed's beat up old junkmobile.</p><p>>aw yeah, riding shotgun.</p><p>>but I'd be lying if I said that the jeer hadn't reminded me of some questions I'd meant to ask.</p><p>>should've asked a lot earlier, probably.</p><p>>"So, Reed," I start as we pull out of the parking area, doing my best to sound nonchalant, "how're you doing? Everything alright on your end?"</p><p>>she gives me a sidelong glance, but doesn't quite take her eyes off the road in front of us.</p><p>>"I am fine. Happy as a clam."</p><p>>well, that would've sounded a whole lot more believeable if there were some more of that Reed-energy in it.</p><p>>not this hollow neutrality.</p><p>>but should I push her on it?</p><p>>I am so not ready for this.</p><p>>cursing myself for having been such a damn social recluse that spent the better part of the time others learn to handle social situations watching japanese cartoons and shitposting, I make another attempt.</p><p>>"That's good. Real good. I am just asking because, you know..."</p><p>>My hands flail in a way that tries to indicate the whole of her body</p><p>>"...all of this seems like something that might take some getting used to-"</p><p>>Reed is still doing her best to focus completely on the road, seemingly determined to shut me out, but she doesn't manage to hide the snort that escapes her.</p><p>>Is this a good sign?</p><p>>fuck it, just keep talking.</p><p>>"-for all of us. So I just want you to know that I am here for you. So if you-"</p><p>>"I appreciate it, Anon."</p><p>>Reed has finally turned to face me.</p><p>>there's a sad little smile on her face and her eyes seem a little wet.</p><p>>"I am going to be honest with you, bro. When I started taking the stuff, I didn't think that it would lead to something like this."</p><p>>she imitates my earlier gesticulating before quickly returning her hands to the wheel.</p><p>>now it's my turn to snort.</p><p>>"but now that it's happened? I don't hate it, man. Not at all. And that's what worries me. I mean, this is the kind of stuff that should make people freak out, right? So why is all I can think 'he, that's kinda neat'? Have I fried my brain that badly over the years?"</p><p>>she pounds the steering wheel.</p><p>>the tears are flowing freely now.</p><p>>trying to reassure her without interrupting, I put my hand on hers when she goes for the clutch.</p><p>>for half a second she pulls back, only to grab my hand hard and hold on to it as if her life depended on it.</p><p>>"And no one seems to miss me, you know? No one at school's asking what happened to good old Reed. Sure, you guys know, our class knows, but besides them? All those little shits that treated me like I was their best bro as long as I hooked them up seem to think that I am just a new student and that their dealer buddy moved. It shouldn't fuck me up like this, dude, but it does. Even Trish, Fang... you, you all just kind of ignored things. Kept on keeping on as if nothing happened. And I get that. 'Reed must be going through something pretty intense right now, best not to make things worse', but what I really needed was someone to affirm my existence. Not just my current one, but that I was there before, you know? Something that says REED WAS HERE in big bold letters. Just- just a sign that people won't forget me."</p><p>>she presses my hand hard, then withdraws, returns it to the steering wheel</p><p>>I feel a warm trickle run down to my wrist: Reed's claws have drawn blood.</p><p>>"Anyways, thank's dude. It was good getting this all out."</p><p>>there's that sad smile again.</p><p>>"Guess it's my own fault for net being more proactive with that shit. Always hated drawing attention to myself."</p><p>>Now that's something I can't quite believe.</p><p>>"Come on, Reed. You are a drummer in a band. You play in front of people. If anyone can handle attention, it's you."</p><p>>"Name one band where the drummer isn't in the back, dude."</p><p>>when I fail to immediately answer, her shoulders sag, as if disappointed.</p><p>>"Besides, we never had big venues."</p><p>>"But what about your parents? Surely they must've noticed something-"</p><p>>"Those fucking deadbeats?" she cuts me off. "They never noticed me getting high. Not even dealing. If they thought anything was different, they'd tell themselves it's just a phase. Raptor Jesus knows they'd never confront me about it."</p><p>>the car decelerates as it pulls into a parking spot and only now do I notice that we have arrived in front of Fang's house.</p><p>>"Alright, dude. Final destination. Get out and good luck."</p><p>>"You aren't sticking around?"</p><p>>"Anon, I think the last thing Fang wants to see right now is the two of us together."</p><p>>My face must given away how I feel about leaving Reed on her own after she has just unloaded all her emotional baggage on me, because the sad smile returns yet again.</p><p>>"Hey, come on bro. I'll be alright. Go and make things right with your girlfriend."</p><p>>"You sure that you don't want to stay?"</p><p>>"Yeah, dude. Who knows, perhaps I shoot up a bunch of test, come back to school tomorrow as my old self. Wouldn't that be something?"</p><p>>her smile gains a desperate quality as her attempt at a joke falls flat.</p><p>>"Do what feels right to you," I tell her. "Whatever it is, I'll have your back. The others will, too."</p><p>>I finally get out of the car and offer her a parting fist bump through the open window.</p><p>>"I'll call you later, alright?"</p><p>>she lightly taps her knuckles against mine.</p><p>>"Yeah. And thanks again for listening to my bullshit, Anon."</p><p>>before I have a chance to add something, she steps on the gas.</p><p>>I watch the little car go until it disappears around a corner.</p>
