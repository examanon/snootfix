Guess they wanted grandchildren or something.</p><p>> Everyone is crying and super emotional. </p><p>> I can’t help but snicker. “They have no idea they're getting so punked right now!”</p><p>> “I know bro!” Reed replies enthusiastically.</p><p>> It’s a nice ceremony, but it’s mostly just that, a ceremony</p><p>> We decide to actually get legally married a few days later just to make taxes easier</p><p>> Make passionate tender love with Reed on our wedding night, just to make sure it looks super ultra legit</p><p>> Get a job as a sound engineer and start making real big money</p><p>> Decide to buy a real house, of course, my best bro can move in with me</p><p>> We live a happy life for about a year until Reed gets another brilliant idea</p><p>> “Her bro, let’s have a kid!”</p><p>> I chuckle at his brilliant, yet ultimately impossible plan. “I really like your enthusiasm, but you can’t get preggers”</p><p>> Reed gets another idea. “Why don’t we ask Fang if she wants to be our surrogate?</p><p>> “Dude! You’re a genius!”</p><p>> We kiss again for luck</p><p>> We call up Fang and tell her we want a kid and that if she would do us the honor of being our surrogate</p><p>> Fang seems to get all sad and mopey at first, but she’s actually overjoyed for a reason that I can’t quite figure out</p><p>> The night comes when I have to impregnate Fang. It’s a bit awkward after so many years of only having sex with Reed, but I get the gist of it down and get down to the deed</p><p>> Fang seems to be a lot happier than I expected her to be. Almost seems like it’s some kind of dream come true for her</p><p>> Reed is right beside us the whole time</p><p>> I do see a small flash of jealousy in his eyes, and it makes me a bit sad that he can't join us</p><p>> Then I get a brilliant idea for our joke. What if we, like, both do the deed with Fang. That way, it's like it would be not just my child, but OUR child</p><p>> Brilliant Anon!</p><p>> I tell Reed my plan. He burst into laughter but is overjoyed at hearing my idea.</p><p>> Fang seems troubled at first, but she quickly shrugs and accepts our little plan.</p><p>> Reed and I do our part, and before we know it, both of ours seeds go into Fang. Fate will take care of the rest now.</p><p>> Reed and I laugh our asses off at our accomplishment.</p><p>> It’s all a part of the prank!</p><p>> Nine months later, Fang gives birth to a healthy baby girl</p><p>> She looks a little like Fang, so I and Reed decide to call her Amber after the color of our friend's eyes</p><p>> Fang is a bit conflicted about it at first, but she ultimately concedes</p><p>> Reed, Fang, and myself raise the kid for several years</p><p>> Need to make sure Amber grows up to be super cool and a true sis to all</p><p>> Snuggling in bed with Reed on a lazy Sunday morning, listening to our child watch cartoons downstairs</p><p>> Although, now that I think about it...</p><p>> Maybe, just maybe.... my bro might be kinda into me?</p><p>> And you know what, that’s okay in my book</p><p>> Because the truth is I fell in love with Reed before our prank even got started</p><p>> I snicker to myself</p><p>> Wait until I tell him that he was the one who got punked!</p></div>
