Fang is already there, sitting at the table. She's absentmindedly eating her breakfast with one hand and fiddling with her phone with the other. A distinct clack punctuates every moment her clawed finger meets the surface of the phone's screen. You hear a muffled 'Mornin'' from her, mouth still stuffed with food. </p><p>There are two cups of coffee on the table, one for each of you. You grab the closest one and take a sip. The grimace on your face makes you reconsider drinking it plain black. Fang, on the other hand, is loading up hers with sugar. She gingerly picks up a sugar cube from the bowl on the table and drops it into her cup, her black nails acting like miniature pincers. Next up, she goes for the small carton of cream. Instead of fiddling with the edges, Fang pierces the cardboard with an obsidian claw. She licks the cream off of her finger before pouring the contents of the box into her coffee. While drinking the coffee, the claws on her free hand tap on the surface of the table, creating an impromptu rhythm. </p><p>"Anon, you're staring again."</p><p>Fangs' voice breaks you out of your reverie. She lets out a small sigh before caressing your face, her tiny black daggers leave the faintest of traces on your face.</p><p>"Gotta go to work early this morning. I'll see you when I get home, yeah?"</p><p>She grabs her bag, her car keys, and phone before heading for the door. She pauses on the threshold, turns around, and smiles at you.</p><p>"Love you."</p><p>Fang is sitting on the couch, xrox controller in hand. Behind and pressed very close to her is Anon, his hands on top of hers, trying to guide her movements.</p><p>"I'm gonna be honest with you, dweeb. The guitar lesson in my room was way more romantic."</p><p>"Oh come on Fang."</p><p>"It just seems like you're recreating that scene from Patrock Swayze's Ghost. You could've at least taken off your shirt."</p><p>Anon thinks to himself that he should start working out already. </p><p>"Another thing. You had no idea how to hold a guitar. I know how to hold a controller. Honestly, this is ju-"</p><p>Anon stops Fang from picking apart his romantic idea any further by kissing her. After a minute he pulls back so they can catch their breath. Fangs' eyelashes flutter as she comes out of her daze.</p><p>"Fine, points for trying, but this isn't over."</p><p>Before Anon can respond Fang grabs him by the back of his head and pulls him in for another kiss.</p><p>I have massively underestimated just how scary 'The Grugde' is. Fang is too engrossed in the movie to notice I'm clinging to her like a scared child. Unable to deal with what's currently happening on the screen, I bury my face in my ptero gfs shoulder and wait it out. There's a shriek and I can suddenly feel another pair of hands worming their way between Fang and me. From the whimpering, I quickly figure out it's Trish.</p><p>"Trish, what the hell are you doing?"</p><p>"Me? What are you doing?"</p><p>My trembling voice does not help me sound convincing, "I'm hugging my girlfriend, what does it look like?"</p><p>"It looks like you're covering like a little bitch."</p><p>"Not like you're any better. Go get your own support ptero."</p><p>Trish holds on to Fang a little tighter and hisses through her teeth, "I saw her first."</p><p>"Well, she's my girlfriend, so that supersedes you."</p><p>Another shriek, this time From Fang. She puts her arms around both of us and covers us all with her wings. </p><p>"Jesus fuck Anon, this thing is gonna give me nightmares!" </p><p>It takes her a second to figure out that both Trish and I are holding on to her and trembling more than just a little. </p><p>"Hah, at least I'm not the only one scared."</p><p>There's a light tug on Fangs' wings which are sheltering us from the outside like a pair of little chicks. The ptero peeks out and sees Reed looking at her expectantly. </p><p>"Got room for one more?"</p><p>"You scared too?"</p><p>"Pffft, as if. I just want some of those wings hugs our compadres are currently enjoying. Scoot over Trish"</p><p>"Nine-one-one, what is your emergency?"</p><p>"I think my neighbor is hurting some poor girl. There's been shouting coming from his house for several minutes now."</p><p>"Can you give me your neighbor's address?"</p><p>"It's 89 Incog lane."</p><p>"Thank you, ma'am, we'll send someone over to check."</p><p>A few minutes later, a police car rolls up next to the sidewalk of the reported address. Two policemen exit the car, an older out shape human and a younger stegosaur. Nothing resembling violence can be heard during their short walk to the front door. What they do hear though is something that could only be described as sporadic and very loud praying. </p><p>"You better hope this isn't some weird cult shit, rookie. Would be a hell of a first night on the job otherwise."</p><p>The younger officer does his best to appear professional and loudly bangs on the front door.</p><p>"Open up!"</p><p>The older officer sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. </p><p>"Didn't they teach you anything at the academy? Do it again, and this time announce it's the cops for Pete's sake."</p><p>Flustered from such a basic mess up, the rookie bangs on the door again. Before he can announce who it is, an angry female voice can be heard shouting inside the house. </p><p>"Calm the fuck down, I'm on my way."</p><p>Moments later, the door is yanked open by a very angry and sweaty ptero woman wrapped in a bedsheet. </p><p>"Do you fucks have any idea what ti-"</p><p>The woman's words die in her mouth as she realizes who's at the door. She clears her throat and does her best to ignore the fact that she just cussed out a pair of cops. </p><p>"What seems to be the problem, officers?"</p><p>The older policeman steps forward and speaks before the rookie gets a chance to mess up the situation any further.</p><p>"We got a report about a domestic disturbance. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"</p><p>"Me? No, can't say that I do."</p><p>"Well, the sounds coming from your house were quite suspicious, miss..."</p><p>"Mous. And I have no idea what you're talking about."</p><p>"This is no time to play dumb, ma'am. My partner and I clearly heard some sort of odd prayer all the way to the street."</p><p>Suddenly, the woman's face starts turning bright red. She can't look at the officer anymore and starts laughing nervously. Before the officer can resume his questioning, a male voice is heard from inside of the house.</p><p>"Fang? Everything OK over there?"</p><p>Upon hearing the man's voice, the ptero woman's blush becomes even more intense. Seconds later, a half-naked human male appears behind the woman. A half-empty glass of orange juice in hand, he comes up next to the ptero and puts an arm around her. Unlike the woman, he doesn't seem embarrassed at all. Rather, oddly proud and just a little bit smug.</p><p>"Hello, officers. Anything we can do for you?"</p><p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out what was going on. The younger policeman makes his way back to the car before his barely contained snickering transforms into full-on laughter, leaving his colleague to finish up with the couple.</p><p>"No. No, everything is fine. Sorry to interrupt you so late in the evening." </p><p>The older officer turns to follow his partner, before stopping and searching his pockets for something. Finding what he was looking for, he hands the ptero woman a business card.</p><p>"Something that should help prevent further embarrassment, miss." </p><p>Fang waits for the cop to get to his car and drive away before looking at the little scrap of paper in her hands. She can only read the title 'Sam's soundproofing' before another wave of embarrassment hits her.</p></div>
