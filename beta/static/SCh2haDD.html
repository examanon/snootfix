                    <p>Title: Harsh Truth</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Nasera</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot </p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>>I don't know what's wrong with Nasera as of late. It really worries me.</p><p>>I thought she had overcome everything dragging her spirit down. </p><p>>Her innocent yet somewhat endearing racism was all but eradicated after she decided to learn of human history and all their struggles. Her problems with Fang were all but overcome after the two sister had their heart to heart. She had even achieved her goal of getting Volcano High into the records books by almost breaking a world record, which now put our school as the top when it came to sports.</p><p>>We even started dating. Wasn't easy at first, species divide and whatnot, but dammit, we've made it work somehow</p><p>>Yet... something still seems to be eating away at my beautiful ptero GF's soul... and it's tearing me apart...</p><p>>Did I say something wrong?</p><p>>Oh god, I hope this isn't about little kiss Fang gave me as a thanks for helping her see how fucked she was being towards her sister...</p><p>>I mean, I guess it could be taken as a form of cheating...</p><p>>Shit. Way to go Anon. Fucking your relationship like you fuck everything else in your life!</p><p>>Fuck. Time to bite the bullet, I guess...</p><p>>I find Nasera sitting by one of the benches in the back of the school. She's looking very dour.</p><p>>It drives knives into my heart to see her that way...</p><p>>I walk up to my girlfriend. She doesn't seem to notice me until the last second, at which point she forces herself to perk up.</p><p>>"Oh, hey babe! H-how are you doing?"</p><p>>"I could ask you the same thing," I reply, taking a seat next to Nasera</p><p>>I grab her hand and look deep into her eyes</p><p>>"Sweets... what's wrong? You haven't been acting like your usual self lately... and it's got me worried sick!" I start pleading with my girlfrield. "Please, if it's something I've done, I'm sorry. I'll do better next time, I promise."</p><p>>Nasera's face contorts into one of sorrow as she breaks down weeping, each wail further driving the dagger already in my heart deeper and deeper.</p><p>>Oh no...</p><p>>Nasera grabs my idle hand and sobs, her breath ragged.</p><p>>"It's not something you've done, Anon... it's me..." Nasera whispers bitterly as she turns away from me. "I... haven't been honest with you from the start..."</p><p>>She takes a deep breath, almost as if steeling herself for what's to come.</p><p>>"Anon... My name wasn't Nasera originally..." My girlfriend tightens her grip on my hands as she forces herself to look me in the eye.</p><p>>"I-I was born as... Naser..."</p><p>>The words take the literal air out of my lungs.</p><p>>Despite having a thousand and one thoughts coursing through my mind, I can't find myself being able to vocalize any of them</p><p>>I try to make sense of it. Try to understand the situation I've been trust into, to almost no avail...</p><p>>My girlfriend... the girl that lifted me from my previous life of shit, gave me a shot at something grander than myself, let me rise above what I thought were the limitation god and the universe deemed hilarious to curse upon me, the girl I fell in love with almost at first sight for her charm, her charisma, her ability to see beyond the pathetic excuse of a human that I once was... </p><p>>...Isn't even a girl to begin with...</p><p>>At that thought, my mind completely freezes.</p><p>>I just stare into Nasera—no... Naser's—beautiful amber eyes as I try to unfuck my brain</p><p>>The urge to laugh comes first.</p><p>>Of course. How very funny of god, or the universe, or the demiurge, of whatever the fuck controlled reality to do this to me</p><p>>In a cosmic sort of way, it was funny. Hilarious, even</p><p>>Build up all my hopes, all my dreams; make me think that I had scored in life, that I had made it... only to pull the rug right under my feet</p><p>>Then the urge to cry starts to rear its head</p><p>>Despair, all encompassing threatens to grip my heart.</p><p>>How could it not when discovering that the girl that I love isn't a girl...</p><p>>That the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with cant ever and will never give me a child, that we'll never be a true family?</p><p>>Rage comes next naturally</p><p>>I should get up from this bench, shout at Naser for her—his—deception.</p><p>>Break this charade off, march off in a rage and never look back.</p><p>>This is an absolute betrayal, after all. Why go on for so long without telling me the truth, leading me on believing a fucking lie!?</p><p>>...</p><p>>I make my decision. One that I know will shape my future...</p><p>>I look Nasera in the eye.</p><p>>She flinches, probably expecting the worst</p><p>>I let out a sigh and steel myself</p><p>>Without a word, I let go of Nasera's hands</p><p>>She closes her eyes and lowers her head in seeming acceptance.</p><p>>Without another word, I wrap my arms around Nasera, bringing her in for the tightest hug I could possibly give her.</p><p>>Yes, I'm mad, yes I'm sad, yes I'm betrayed and devastated and all that shit that emotions make one feel</p><p>>But right now, none of that matters</p><p>>Even if Nasera is Naser, even if she's packing a fucking sausage between her legs, even if she can never ever be what my primal monkey brain desires...</p><p>>Nasera is still Nasera.</p><p>>And nothing's going to change that for me.</p><p>>"You're lucky I'm into that shit," I lie to Nasera, knowing well what I'm getting myself into</p><p>>But I don't care anymore.</p><p>>This isn't about me. It never was.</p><p>>It was always about her...</p>
