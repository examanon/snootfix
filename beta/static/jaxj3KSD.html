This is told from Fang's perspective.</p><p>​</p><p>Lately school has been pretty chill, maybe it's the skin- I mean… Anon, the one</p><p>that I got a crush on since he conforted me that time on the roof and made me</p><p>feel "safe" and calm.</p><p>I approach the school, go to the hall entrace to find Trish and Reed sitting</p><p>on the front rows of the hall. As I sit down and continue to chat with Trish</p><p>while Reed looks stoned as shit, I spot Anon at the entrance.</p><p>"Oi Anon, sit with us!"</p><p>"I reserved a place for you, bro!"</p><p>"Ugh, here it comes the skinnie."</p><p>After Anon sits right besides me the principal everyone covers their ears to</p><p>prepare for him.</p><p>"ALLLLRIIIIGHT! So, as you know, you are all seniors. As such you'll need to</p><p>guide the younger students in order to put them in the right path, help them in</p><p>making their choices and so on. Without further ado, I'll give Naomi the mic."</p><p>Me and Trish pull back our heads while Reed is still in Dino-land and Anon looks</p><p>bored as fuck. How could you blame him?</p><p>That bitch goes up on stage and starts speaking with her nauseating voice.</p><p>"Oh my~ Thank you so much for coming to the presentation of our program for</p><p>junior students."</p><p>As she speak, she starts displaying on the whiteboard via the projector several</p><p>slides.</p><p>Everything goes well, until I see a picture of Anon, standing in place with his</p><p>shoulder over a photoshopped anime girl.</p><p>And the photos go on, and on, and on…</p><p>Everyone starts laughing at the sight of these photos while I try to process</p><p>what just happened.</p><p>What the hell are those photos?!</p><p>I remember that Anon said something about changing schools because of a</p><p>"unexplicably bad problem": maybe this is why Anon actually transferred here?</p><p>I look towards Anon's seat, which became empty: he has rushed towards the hall</p><p>doors and I immediately follow him.</p><p>Anon sprins towards the exit of the building, running like hell.</p><p>"ANON! WAIT *pant* A *pant* MINUTE *pant* GODDAMNIT!"</p><p>He doesn't respond to my pleads and simply runs towards the street… I couldn't</p><p>catch up with him.</p><p>Fuck! Where does he live?! I can't even go to his house!</p><p>Aaargh I should have asked for his address, goddamnit.</p><p>I return back to where I came from, where I can see Reed waiting near the</p><p>principal's office door.</p><p>"Hey Reed. Why are you waiting here?"</p><p>"Hey Fang, the principal got a hold of Trish and he's scolding her."</p><p>"Oh really?"</p><p>Then Trish comes out of the door, sobbing like a little bitch.</p><p>I do not know what even should I say about this whole situation I mean… She</p><p>just doxed my new friend in front of dozens of students and she's acting like</p><p>she's the victim here.</p><p>"Why… did you do this…? Was this really fucking necessary?"</p><p>"I'm- *sniff* s-sorry…"</p><p>I get even more pissed at her: "Oh? You are sorry? YOU ARE SORRY? WHAT THE FUCK</p><p>IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT MADE YOU THINK THAT IT WAS RIGHT TO DOX HIM IN FRONT</p><p>OF MULTIPLE PEOPLE?"</p><p>Trish couldn't reply that well but I could at least hear these words:</p><p>"I-I j-just scared t-that the s-skinnie would s-s..."</p><p>"Would WHAT? SPEAK UP!"</p><p>She explodes: "I WAS SCARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU AWAY FROM OUR BAND!</p><p>OUR FRIENDSHIP! I DO NOT TRUST HIM."</p><p>As she wipes her tears with her hoodie she continues.</p><p>"Some nobody comes into our school, enters our lives and ruins our band! He</p><p>hasn't once told us about where he came from, what he actually does, NOTHING!</p><p>Can you even consider him as a friend?"</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Then Reed spoke with a unusually disappointed and righteous tone.</p><p>"Trish, that was, like, uncalled for. He's not a bad person: I just think that</p><p>he doesn't want to stand out. But still, what you did is wrong. You should</p><p>really apologize to him."</p><p>She didn't answer at all, keeping her head low.</p><p>"I'm going to leave the band for a while… I need some time for myself."</p><p>Trish looked at me with even more watered eyes, as her world shattered</p><p>completely.</p><p>He looked at me with sorrow and a sad look on his face: none of us could have </p><p>believed what just happended today.</p><p>The day goes by and the only thing that I can think of is Anon. I hope that it</p><p>didn't damage him that much… I send a message afterwards to see if he's alright.</p><p>FANG: Hey are you ok dude?</p><p>After an hour and half I didn't get neither a "read" notification or any kind of</p><p>response. God I'm getting worried about him: I hope to see him tomorrow so I can</p><p>repay the favor that he gave to me.</p><p>## The next day... ##</p><p>So far I've been nervous for the entire way up to school and when I arrive at</p><p>the Volcano High entrance I do not see Anon anywhere.</p><p>It's understandable, given yesterday's events. But I can't shake the feeling</p><p>that something really bad is going to happen…</p><p>Principal Spears appears in front of me and asks me to follow him in his office.</p><p>Maybe it's about Anon?</p><p>"I'm glad that you followed me in my office, Fang."</p><p>"No problem sir. So you wanted to talk about Anon, right?"</p><p>"Pretty sharp, if I say so myself. Yes, that's right. I've tried to call Anon's</p><p>parents but they do not seem to care about their son that much considering that</p><p>they seemed unfazed by what I've told about them. So I was thinking: why don't</p><p>you go check up on him?"</p><p>"Me? Really? I mean sure I can go. But I do not know where he lives."</p><p>He gave me his address, then he put his oversized hand on my shoulder and with</p><p>a sort of "parental" but earnest look said</p><p>"I have great hope in you for putting Anon back to his feet. You may go now."</p><p>"Yes, thanks Mr.Spears"</p><p>I got out from there and now I have the responsibility of putting Anon back on</p><p>track. Ugh I'm getting scared… Am I even capable of doing something like this?</p><p>Deep down I know that Anon needs my help: he helped me on the top of the roof</p><p>so I want to repay the favor.</p><p>"Hey Fang, have you heard of Anon?"</p><p>Reed pops out of nowhere with his usual care-free tone.</p><p>"Hey Reed. No, sadly he didn't respond, but the principal asked me to go to his</p><p>house to check up on him. He gave me Anon's address."</p><p>"Cool! So where does he live? We can, like, go check up on him together if you</p><p>want."</p><p>I hesitantly respond "He lives in Skin Row."</p><p>"Oh… That's gonna be a little problem… But oh well, if we are together it will</p><p>be safer."</p><p>Reed's not wrong. Skin Row is regarded as one of the worst zones of Volcadera</p><p>where usually junkies and/or other humans live. I'm a little worried to be</p><p>honest… For the sake of Anon I will go there but I first want to speak to Anon</p><p>alone, maybe he feels more comfortable if I am the only one there."</p><p>"Reed, thank you but I think that Anon will only speak up to me, at least for</p><p>now. Please!"</p><p>Reed looks at me with a sad look but agrees.</p><p>"Ok then… Let me know how it went: if you need my help, you can, like, call me."</p><p>"Sure. I'll call you later."</p><p>So I decide to check on Anon after the classes, get the bus and see if he's</p><p>alright.</p><p>*So this is where he lives… No wonder he's on welfare* I think to myself.</p><p>I knock on the door, no response whatsoever.</p><p>I retry knocking on the door, and again I do not get a response,</p><p>After insisting I saw the door open only to be presented with a very pale Anon</p><p>and bags under his eyes.</p><p>"Jesus you look like shit."</p><p>"Did you come here just to shit on me like everyone else? Then fuck off."</p><p>"No Anon wait! I came here to check up on you!" He looked at me with a</p><p>dumbfolded expression before registering what I just said.</p><p>"... Come inside then. Welcome to ‘La casa del Shithole!’"</p><p>He closes the door behind me and I sit on the floor while he just throws himself</p><p>on the bed with an empty look on his eyes.</p><p>"Anon… I'm sorry that this happened to you I mean- I never thought that her of</p><p>all people would pull a stunt like that."</p><p>He suddently flinches and snaps at me, surprising me with a very unnatural</p><p>angry tone and open wide eyes</p><p>"OH REALLY? WHO DO YOU THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN HUH? SHE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT</p><p>COULD HAVE PULLED A DICK MOVE LIKE THAT!"</p><p>The usually calm and composed Anon that I knew transformed in a rage-filled,</p><p>maniac looking one which really scared me as it was something that I've never</p><p>believed could come out from someone like him.</p><p>"Anon please, just calm down. I came here to speak to you… I'm sorry that Trish</p><p>pulled a stunt like that! I never though that she would do something like-"</p><p>"IT DOESN'T MATTER! NOW EVERYONE IS JUST THROWING SHIT AT ME! I NEVER WANTED</p><p>THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN!"</p><p>So I was right that he changed schools for this. Sure the fact that he posed like</p><p>that in these pictures was cringy but still…</p><p>"I did whatever I could to remain as anonymous as possible! I didn't do anything</p><p>to piss someone off and what do I get?!?! I GET RIDICULED IN FRONT OF ALL THE</p><p>FUCKING STUDENTS! AND IT'S ALL THAT PURPLE BITCH'S FAULT! I-"</p><p>Before he could finish I approached him and put his head on my chest to make him</p><p>calm down.</p><p>"Look Anon. I know that you are having it rough, I understand your pain. You</p><p>helped me on the top of the roof when I felt distressed about my identity, my</p><p>problems… Now I want to repay the favor by helping you. You need support right</p><p>now and I'm here for that." I said this in the hope of calming him down… But it</p><p>didn't work: instead he steadily jumps out of the bed and backs off from me,</p><p>shouting like a madman.</p><p>"NO YOU DON'T GET IT! I TRIED EVERYTHING TO BE A SHADOW, TO NOT BE NOTICED BY</p><p>ANYONE AND YET…and yet… I find you three, especially your schizo friend who</p><p>hated me for no good reason…"</p><p>He collapses on his knees and as I slowly approach him…</p><p>"I just… Leave me alone please… I don't want to speak to anyone right now."</p><p>Devastated and without anything worth to say to him, I simply leave, closing</p><p>the door, hearing him sob and in fetal position on the floor.</p><p>I just wanted to help him… And yet, I didn't manage to do a single fucking</p><p>thing. I'm so goddamn useless… But as I went home I could not shake the feeling</p><p>that something terrible was going to happen. I can feel it but not understand</p><p>what exactly…</p></div>
