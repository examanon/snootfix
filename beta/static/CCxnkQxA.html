Your fingers look raw as fuck." Fang strums the strings of her guitar one last time before placing it down, resting the neck against her bed. I do the same, minus the strumming as my fingertips are red from the hours of abuse.</p><p>"Wouldn't be like this if you weren't such a slave driver of a teacher. A good one, but still, piss off." She lets out a devilish snicker at my back-handed compliment, elbowing in the shoulder lightly. Still exhausted, I let myself fall back into her bed, my brows now furrow in thought as I start thinking.</p><p>It's nice to be able to meet up with Fang again, especially since we hadn't seen each other for a week. A voluntary choice on both of our ends, as we decided it was best to wait out the rest of her estrus before hanging out. As good as the sex was, and as tempting as fucking each others brains out on a daily basis was to the both of us, we decided that her father finding out and caving my bald head in with a nine iron really wasn't worth it.</p><p>My mind attempts to wander back a bit farther, but it's interrupted as I suddenly notice Fang's face looming over mine, a dangerous smirk spread across her beak. "Well, thinking about it, I wouldn't be a good teacher if I didn't reward my student, so how about I let you do something kinky?"</p><p>I shoot up near instantly, the ptero barely managing to get out of the way in time to prevent us from bumping heads. "Are you messing with me, or you mean it?". There's a mix of nervousness and excitement in my voice as I stare her dead in the eyes.</p><p>"Y-Yeah. So uh, you got any ideas?" The bravado and confidence in her voice just moments before  is suddenly missing. She places a hand in my lap almost expectedly, but I'm already lost in thought as I try to recall something.</p><p>Ever since our first time, I've been looking for tips to use in the future on my Chinese Cartoon Torrenting Site. A lot of it seemed... Dubious at best, but there's currently one that sticks out in my mind.</p><p>I reach out and grab Fang by her shoulders, bringing her closer as I autistically blurt "I'm going to dominate you." Her face goes beat red, and I can feel that she's about to open her mouth to say something. I can't have her doing that though, that'd ruin everything.</p><p>I unhinge my jaw and take in the tip of Fang's snoot into my mouth before sliding further down her length. The blush on her cheeks is replaced by an annoyed scowl on her face from this stupid idea, but it soon fades into a once of what I assume is amusement. It's kind of hard to tell with most of her mouth down my throat at the moment.</p><p>I give an experimental suck, which gets a giggle out of her, and I instantly figure out the problem with this arrangement. If she moves her mouth, it pushes against my teeth and jaws, and that actually really hurts. But if I stop now, I'm just going to look like an idiot, so fuck that. I continue sucking and sliding my mouth up and down her beak, getting more giggles and more pushing against my jaw for my trouble. There's a smug look in her eyes, and now I know she's doing this on purpose.</p><p>That's it, I'm not going to be mocked any longer. I'm going to show this beautiful ptero bitch that I'm an alpha caveman. Pulling up my metaphorical britches, I take as much of her snout as I can into my throat and then some, nearly gagging as the only sort of training I've had for this was deepthroating a banana once in middle school. I feel kind of slightly accomplished about how much I'm able to fit in my virgin mouth, but that feeling is short-lived as I feel something warm and slimy wiggle deep into my throat.</p><p>I begin to sputter and choke, pushing Fang away and out of my maw as she begins full on laughing, tears rolling down her face as her chest heaves heavily. "Hahaha holy shit Anon, what the fuck did you think was gonna happen!?"</p><p>"Did you just fucking shoot a salty surprise down my gullet!? The fuck???" The coughing has subsided, but I'm still rubbing my throat to try and get rid of the weird sticky feeling. She grins, sticking out her tongue in response, and probably the answer as I finally understand what just violated me.</p><p>She waits for me to fully calm down, before picking up her guitar again, plucking a few of the strings with her claws. "Anyway, I think that's enough of a reward for now... So what part of the song were we on again?". Fang pauses, scratching her neck in thought for a bit before remembering.</p><p>"Oh, yeah. We're starting off from 'Like a million faces'. "</p></div>
