Fang. Fang. Fang. Fang. Fang. "</p><p>>Even when you try and think of something else, anything else, the sound of the name in your head envelops everything else completely. Nothing can match the intensity of this one single name.</p><p>>Your heart beats even faster, and you can feel your throat begin to constrict under the assault your body is experiencing. </p><p>>The corners of your eyes burn for the first time in years. </p><p>>A slow gasping breath escapes from your mouth and your chest heaves upwards.</p><p>>This can't be real, how can this be happening?</p><p>>You can't help but wonder if you're broken somehow, trying to understand why this of all things is what calls a reaction to come fourth from you. </p><p>>You can see your friends dissapear, your relatives die, your life pass by right before your eyes and not even bat an eyelid. </p><p>>All the hallmarks of milestones and keystone moments in a real, single life of your own can't compare to what you are feeling right now.</p><p>>It's like nothing else feels real except what you are feeling right now.</p><p>>Even though it's 'just a game', and she is 'just a character', it feels unbelievably more real than anything you have felt in a long time.</p><p>>And that is why your soul is screaming in pain, and lashing out to finally feel something amidst all this chaos.</p><p>>You care for Fang, and in doing so, you remember that you are human after all, and that is what she loves most about you.</p><p>>You can't help but smile amidst the now free falling tears, the warmth of the feeling you have for her becoming almost as warm as her enveloping wings.</p>
