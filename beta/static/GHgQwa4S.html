It's just as awkward as it was with Fang when we first tried, but thanks to my experience I'm able to guide him correctly. I run my hands over his lithe muscular back, basking in the moment, before pulling my head away to gasp for air.</p><p>"Shit, Naser. Are you sure? Aren't you and Naomi still a thing? And what about your sister?" Naser smirks, a hand expertly snaking down into my pants as he finds my growing erection. Clawed finger tips delicately grab hold of my salomi, and I let out a moan as he begins rubbing his hand up and down the length.</p><p>There's a shit eating grin on his face as he leans in next to my ear, his voice a  husky whisper. "Don't worry. No homo." Those four words are enough to send me over the edge, my mind suddenly racing back to green hills and tall palm trees. That's right. My favorite childhood game. The one on the Gamerock. I remember now. My mouth twists in an unnatural way as I shout the name out in a guttural growl. "SONIC HEROES!". Naser just continues to jerk me off as I cum actual gallons worth of semen, though he's actually joining in on my shouts. "SONIC HEROOOOOES!"</p><p>"GIVE US A REASON..." Finally, after all this time, I find someone that truly gets me. I'm starting to pass out again, but I have to complete it. My newly found ptero boyfriend seems to notice my waning consciousness, and harmonizes with me on the final line. "AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY!"</p></div>
