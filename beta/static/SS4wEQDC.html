<h1>Perfect Situation Chapter 8</h1><div><p>Chapter 8: Precious Metal Girl</p><p>​</p><p>The few days off that I intended to take ended up turning into an entire week. There was far too much to think about, normally I'd smoke to help myself focus but something stayed my hand. My exercise, my meals, my addiction had all been tightly controlled for so long. Even without any interference from Trish, I found myself following them. It's not like they were bad habits, plenty of people fought to earn them after all. I wasn't so sure I could spin a healthier lifestyle as being a negative thing even if Trish was manipulative. At the very least I could use this as an excuse to fill my pantry with all sorts of delicious goodies. I'm a grown-ass man, if I want to start my day with a bowl of Chieftan Crunch then I will!</p><p>Thankfully I had at least one thing to keep me busy that was untainted by Trish, my music. Though calling the strained warbling that came from my throat 'music' was probably stretching the definition. I may have lived in one of the shittiest neighborhoods a person could find as far as Volcadera Bluff was concerned but that had benefits. In this instance, it meant that neighbors were thankfully few and far between so there was no one to hear me practice. It also meant that authority officials turned a blind eye to this district, I tried not to think about that part. Unsurprisingly, learning and mastering a new hobby isn't all fun and games. I was getting keenly acquainted with just how rough I sounded, it's not like I could afford a tutor. That forced me to record my attempts and play them back to check my pitch. I probably would have given up on it but every now and then I put some earphones on and sang along to the music just to pretend for a little while that what I heard in those songs was how I really sounded, how I COULD sound.</p><p>I tried listening to some of the band's Tana listed off but as much as this wealth of punk and rock left my head bobbing and toes tapping they weren't any good for singing along to. Not for lack of trying, it was easy to see why Fang liked this stuff when the angry lyrics seemed to be spoken straight to my soul. Guess people just don't make record-breaking pop songs about being poor, angry, and alone. For all my enthusiasm to wail my sorrows and frustrations, I just lacked the ability to make it sound good. I shelved those tracks for later, fortunately, there was one pick-me-up to look forward to at the weeks end. The church of our lord and savior Raptor Jesus was quickly proving to be a second home for me, didn't think I'd ever say that. Showing up Sunday led to an incredibly warm reception, Rosa was ecstatic to see me of course but even my fellow chorus members greeted me like an old friend. That last part I found particularly surprising, I was certain I did nothing but drag down their quality yet they didn't seem to mind in the slightest.</p><p>Alan approached me again during our warm-ups to make sure I was getting along alright. While the practice I got during the week helped me with fundamentals, I could breathe with my diaphragm now, It didn't seem to do much for my actual sound. When I asked him if he had any more advice the fatherly man just laughed and gave me his number, saying to call any time. I tried to tell him I couldn't afford to pay but Alan waved me off saying it wasn't important. What do you even say to something like that? I had realistically only talked to our choir lead for a few hours and the man was willing to teach me just because I asked? A thanks and a shake of his hand seemed like a paltry reward but it was all I could give him. Based on the knowing smiles of the other choir members this probably wasn't the first time he did something like this. Alan was an incredible guy, really, everyone here was. I still don't know how much I bought into this whole organized religion thing but if it got so many kind people together it couldn't be all bad.</p><p>The surprises had yet to cease when I took to the church loft. There was one person I never would have expected to see standing in the corner. Completely clashing with the well-dressed churchgoers in a ratty black top and well-worn jeans, leaning against the wall rather than seated with everyone else. Fang was drawing more than a few stares, not that she seemed to care. The ptero was ignoring everyone's furtive glances and hushed murmurs yet when she noticed the choir had arrived her amber eyes immediately found mine. It wasn't hard to pick out the only skinnie amongst my colorful compatriots after all. I felt far more nervous with just her watching me than the entire church of people. There was no delaying the performance for my own anxiety so I did my best to focus my attention on anything but Fang. Rosa was seated front and center, her hands clasped together as she looked up at me with veritable stars in her eyes. The womans enthusiasm was as infectious as it always was, it's thanks to the encouraging smile she wore that I felt a little more confident when we started our song.</p><p>Once we had begun it was easy to lose myself in the music, when I next opened my eyes it was at the end of our set. I half expected Fang to be gone but she had remained in her corner. I could have sworn she was smiling when the choir stepped down, In fact, Fang was waving me over now that service ended. I said my goodbyes to my fellow chorus members, but when I went to give my thanks to Alan again but he just shook his head.</p><p>"Oh don't waste time on an old fossil like me." He chuckled. "it's not wise to keep a lady waiting you know." Even when Alan wasn't singing his voice was incredibly rich.</p><p>I wanted to argue but the blue iguanodon had already walked past me, however, just before dissolving into the crowd he paused. I could see that Alan was taking a closer look at Fang before he glanced back at me with a thumbs up and a grin. I couldn't help but match him, that cheeky old fart. Taking his advice I hurried through the crowds until I was accosted by a pair of strong orange arms that actually lifted me off my feet.</p><p>"Oh An-on! I am so proud of you! You have improved so much, so quickly!" Her arms tightened around me, this was almost painful now. "Raptor Jesus must have blessed you himself!"</p><p>"Uh, thanks Rosa." I manage to croak despite her best attempts to break my spine. "Can you let me go, please?"</p><p>"Nope!" she chirped, Those vice-like arms tightened to prove her point.</p><p>Well, this was my life now I guess. There were worse ways to go than being crushed in the embrace of a Latina. Fortunately, Rosa was satisfied with the hug after shaking me about a few times. I'm not sure what was more embarrassing, the fact that I was being treated like a doll or the fact that Rosa felt the need to congratulate me. Surely I haven't made that much progress in a week? My recordings certainly didn't sound like it. The phone in my back pocket buzzed insistently. Retrieving it revealed a handful of text messages, I winced as I stared at the unopened messages from Trish. I was definitely going to open those... eventually, soon, I swear. She was probably just asking when or if I was coming back to work, maybe she had some kind of apology? I'd look at them later, for now, I just didn't have the heart. Scrolling past the old texts revealed the source of the buzzing, A message from Fang?</p><p>Fang: Meet me outside when you're done</p><p>I glanced up at Rosa who was waiting for me with a patient smile while I typed out my reply.</p><p>Anon: She doesn't bite you know</p><p>Apparently Fang already had her phone out because she replied immediately.</p><p>Fang: But she hugs. Pass.</p><p>Alright, that was fair enough. Rosa might actually snap Fang in half given the chance.</p><p>I offered my coral companion an apolegetic smile, "think I'll have to miss lunch today, I'm needed elsewhere." I shook my phone for emphasis</p><p>Rosa's smile took a hit but her chipper tone could have fooled me otherwise.</p><p>"¡no hay problema! But do not think you are escaping next week, Stella needs friends that are not..." Rosa trails off, based on how much she's thinking about what to say next I steel myself for what's coming.</p><p>"Baby rage?"</p><p>Yep, there it is.</p><p>"Rosa, why do you hurt me this way?" I groan from behind my palm.</p><p>The lively Latina didn't respond immediately, instead seeming to dig through her memory for more atrocious internet slang. Deciding against being accosted with weapons-grade cringe I beat a hasty retreat. Waving goodbye with a hurried promise that the three of us would definitely do something next Sunday. I pushed open the doors to the church to find the crowd hadn't dispersed much. Skimming through all the colorful people I couldn't seem to find Fang among them. That was odd, she stuck out nearly as bad as I did with how pale she was. A gray hand shook my shoulder from behind, based on the star tattoo adorning it I had a pretty good idea who it was. Turning around revealed an incredibly smug ptero-girl, how the hell did she always manage to sneak up on me?</p><p>"Alright, that's it." I cross my arms and raise an eyebrow. "Are you some kind of ninja now?"</p><p>Fang shrugs the question off with a smile "Not my fault you're blind as a bat."</p><p>She just always has to be difficult, doesn't she?</p><p>"Fine, what's all this about anyway?" I ask with a roll of my eyes.</p><p>Fang's smile widens at that, "You hear about the music festival coming up? Extinction Event 2025?"</p><p>These meteor dodgers really loved their themed names, when I shook my head Fang blinked in surprise</p><p>"That was supposed to be a rhetorical question, you really didn't know?" She asked in disbelief</p><p>"I'm not exactly the most musical person, Fang. I only just started singing you know."</p><p>"Could've fooled me." She replied casually as if the compliment wouldn't absolutely floor me.</p><p>Fang wasn't the type to just say things like that, if she said it she meant it. Especially when it was about music, something she had a trained ear for.</p><p>"You can't possibly mean that." I chuckle nervously, uncomfortable with the idea.</p><p>"Well, it was a little hard to pick out your voice from the group so I might just have gotten you mixed up." Fang cocks her head as she ponders it for a moment more. "I can tell you're farther along than you should be, you've either been seriously practicing or have a natural talent for it. Maybe both."</p><p>I can't help but protest, "but I've heard myself sing, I'm terrible!"</p><p>Fang looked at me like I was an idiot, well, It's been a while since I've seen that face I suppose.</p><p>"Because you just started, dweeb. It's a muscle you have to exercise like any other." She gestured to my arm before continuing. "Think about it like this, no matter how perfect your technique is you can't lift five hundred pounds without serious training."</p><p>"That... Makes sense. Huh." My nervousness only increased with the realization that I really was acting dumb.</p><p>"It was kinda cute watching you get so into it, like a baby taking their first steps." Fang grinned at the mental image.</p><p>"RIGHT, SO ABOUT THAT FESTIVAL!?" I practically shouted, desperate to move past this embarrassing topic.</p><p>She blinked, apparently just now remembering the original intent of this conversation.</p><p>"The festivals going to be huge this year! Some big names are returning to Volcadera Bluff for it!" Fang's eyes practically twinkled as she went through her mental checklist of them</p><p>"Raptor In Chains is going to be there, Queens Of The Jurassic Age, Ramsaurus and..." She paused for dramatic effect, the grin splitting her face impossibly wide "The Blinders!"</p><p>She cheered out the last name, her hands were shaking with excitement as she held them up to her chest.</p><p>This was the most animated I've ever seen Fang, especially in recent memory. It was stunning to look at the disheveled ptero who had only ever lost her cool to anger suddenly revert back to a little girl.</p><p>"The who?" I asked absent-mindedly, still processing her strange behavior.</p><p>"Me! Us! Our band! I don't know who's dick Claw had to suck or how many but this is it, Our big break! Where we get famous!" Fang explained, far too upbeat to let my ignorance spoil the good news.</p><p>I wasn't able to resist her enthusiasm any longer, I could feel my own smile growing.</p><p>"About damn time, Fang! Ever since I heard first heard you on that guitar I knew you were going somewhere!"</p><p>At the mention of guitar, fang nodded. "That's exactly it, this is the biggest performance of my life. My old axe isn't gonna cut it, I'll need something professional." She gently placed a talon on my chest, still grinning. "That's where you come in."</p><p>"Me? How exactly can I help you with that? I don't know anything about guitars" I reminded her.</p><p>"Sure, doesn't matter." She waves her hand dismissively. 'But we got the news that the band who was actually supposed to perform had to call it the same day you learned how much of a bitch Trish was."</p><p>I winced at the casual insult, It felt wrong to hear something like that come from Fang's mouth. Not to mention I didn't exactly hate Trish, I still didn't know how to feel honestly. Betrayed? Hurt? Confused? Angry? Sad? All of the above?</p><p>"Far as I'm concerned, that makes you a good luck charm. New beginnings and all that" Fang continued, unaware of my internal dialogue.</p><p>Even distracted as I was that struck me as flimsy reasoning.</p><p>"You don't need an excuse to go shopping with your friend, Fang. I'd be happy to spend time with you." I offered gently.</p><p>Fang froze for a moment, guess she didn't expect to be called out so blatantly. Slowly her expression screwed up into an embarrassed smile.</p><p>"Don't say it like that!" She ran a hand through her still growing hair, clearly flustered. "Just call a cab already. Sheesh."</p><p>Cute. Well, if she was so eager to get started then I could hardly blame her. Fishing out my phone I tapped the cab app on my home screen, funny, I don't remember ever installing it. Hardly a moment after I looked up from the phone a yellow car turned the corner, stopping in front of us with a honk. Holding open the car door for Fang rewarded me with a groan but she still climbed in before me. True to his word, once I closed the door behind me I could see a familiar red raptor looking at us from the rearview mirror.</p><p>"Hey, hey! Long time no see, kid! Who's your lady friend?"</p><p>"I'm non-binary actually." Fang corrected him tersely.</p><p>"My apologies, madam!" He replied with an impressively shit-eating grin.</p><p>It took all of my self-control not to laugh, thankfully Fang silenced him with a boot to the back of his chair. I probably shouldn't have found that funny, I supported Fang regardless of her gender identity but his timing was just impeccable.</p><p>Clearing my throat I asked, "Where we headed anyways?"</p><p>"Lil' Tru'" Fang said, still sneering at the cab driver.</p><p>Man, you really can find everything there can't you? The cab driver took off without another word, guess we had a little time to kill. There was at least one question on my mind.</p><p>"So who's Claw?"</p><p>Fang leaned back in her seat and glanced over at me, "He's sort of the unofficial band leader. He's our guitarist and vocalist but I managed to convince Thag to side with me for a solo."</p><p>She seemed quite smug at that accomplishment but I was still confused by these names.</p><p>"Thag? I get Claw, it's kinda like Fang but... Thag?"</p><p>"He's a stegosaurus," Fang replied as if that explained literally anything.</p><p>"Ah, so you're a musician! My apologies, let me put something on." The cab driver reached for the radio, before either of us could respond the windows of the car vibrated with the force of the sound.</p><p>SHOT THROUGH THE HEART</p><p>AND YOU'RE TO BLAME!</p><p>DARLIN' YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME</p><p>Another boot to the back of his seat silenced the music, Fang kicked his headrest so hard I thought we were going to crash.</p><p>"Alright, quit it out will ya!?" Our driver shouted back at us.</p><p>Once he turned his attention to the road however, he ended up chuckling. I could distinctly hear him mutter a "worth it."</p><p>Our remaining drive passed by without incident, Fang regaining her good mood as she started talking about the various bands that were going to be at 'Extinction Event 2025'. She made me promise to buy tickets of course, not that she had to try very hard. I'd never even consider missing her big moment. No small amount of the ride was spent with Fang informing me just what exactly she'd tell her shithead boss at the supermarket when she quit to be a superstar. Notably, there was something to do with a pineapple and his rectum, I'd rather not dwell on the same specifics that she did. Eventually the cab slowed down to a crawl, there were more people on the street than cars.</p><p>"Little Troodon, the one and only!" Our cab driver confirmed my suspicion.</p><p>"Finally! Let's get going, Anon!" Fang exclaimed, practically flying out the door</p><p>I still hadn't quite gotten used to Fang being this high energy, not that I could blame her. If I was a few weeks away from becoming a celebrity I'd probably be just as giddy. Sliding out the other side of the cab I walked over to our driver, wallet in hand. Same as last time however, he held his hand up to stop me.</p><p>"Heh, not this time. I made you two pay plenty along the way here."</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, slipping the wallet back into my pocket. "How the hell do you stay in business?"</p><p>The cab driver cackled, his bushy facial hair bobbing along. "I'm afraid that one's a secret!"</p><p>I glanced back to see Fang impatiently shifting from one foot to the other, her wingtips twitching in anticipation. Should probably wrap this up before she leaves without me.</p><p>"Well, thanks. You got a name?" I grin at him before adding "If you're gonna keep offering free rides I'd like to know who to ask for."</p><p>The cab driver actually looks a little surprised at the question, humming thoughtfully.</p><p>"Don't worry about it, kid. I'm just a cab driver, always have been, always will be" he said without any of his usual pomp and circumstance.</p><p>Just a cab driver, huh? Well, the guy's done me two favors already, he deserves a nickname at least.</p><p>"If ya say so, Probably gonna have to call you to get home. See you then, C-man."</p><p>"Ha! C-man! I like it!"</p><p>Stepping away from the car and its amused driver, Fang grabs me by the arm.</p><p>"Come on! We don't have all day!" She insisted, tugging me along.</p><p>The drive didn't take more than half an hour and church ends at noon, I was fairly certain we had plenty of time to buy a guitar. Still, the sooner we got it the sooner Fang would relax so I let her lead the way. The top she wore left her shoulders bared to the world, that wasn't anything unique as far as Fang's usual dress. What was interesting though, was the fact that her back was scrawled with black ink creeping out from beneath her shirt. Much of the design remained covered but it was clearly a huge tattoo, a web of elegant line work. Fang staggered as our progress was interrupted by other shoppers. Little Troodon was absolutely packed with people of all shapes, sizes, and colors. It was astounding just how popular this little oriental district was.</p><p>"Hey, watch it! Fucking asshole!" Fang screamed as a triceratops slammed into her shoulder.</p><p>"What the- Get outta the way! Move it!" She hollered at a rotund man waddling in front of her, slowing us down.</p><p>"Oh you're so lucky I'm busy right now " She growled as yet another person pushed past her.</p><p>All the while Fang was getting shoved about in this sea of bodies I had noticed something, Not a single person did that to me. Guess the masses were more comfortable bumping into a skinny ptero girl than a meathead skinnie. Hell, thanks to my baldness they probably think I'm from one of those human supremacist groups. My dad's awful genetics come back to haunt me yet again. Still, when I glanced down at my wider frame I could hardly believe it was mine, the lanklet of my youth had come quite a ways. One of Fang's tattered wing's slapped me in the face, interrupting my thoughts. Apparently by accident as both of them were spread wide, She had let go of my arm to clench both her fists. Fang was glaring daggers at a group of people clogging up the street, standing around talking to one another.</p><p>"SKREE-ONK!" She screeched, her voice unrecognizable beneath the feral squawk.</p><p>Both I and the loitering meteor-dodgers took a step back, What the hell was that? Fang's chest was heaving while her attention flickered all around us now that a pocket of onlookers formed in the crowd. I took her hand and pushed us through them myself, it wasn't very difficult thanks to the nervous looks shot our way. Dragging Fang to what passes for a secluded alley in the pedestrian clogged streets I turned back to a very anxious looking ptero.</p><p>"What's going on?" I pleaded, her emotions have been bouncing up and down all day.</p><p>Fang glanced back to the main street, clutching at herself protectively.</p><p>"Just nervous, you know how Lil' Tru' is." She rubbed her shoulders uncertainly. "Guitars are expensive, if anything happened..."</p><p>I sighed, that was pretty understandable. It's not like either of us were the richest people after all.</p><p>"I really need this to go well, Anon." She continued unbidden, the desperation in her voice was palpable. "I just need something to go right for once."</p><p>I nodded, a sense of determination taking over. If anyone deserved it, it was Fang.</p><p>"Alright, What's this place called?"</p><p>She looked a little unsure at my tone shift but answered anyway, "White Forest, it's at the north end. Why?"</p><p>I grinned in response, "You just keep an eye out for thieves and stay behind me, I'll get us there." I hooked a thumb towards my chest for emphasis. "Just call me Mr. Plow!"</p><p>Fang stared at me in disbelief for the second time today but the crack of a smile slowly started spreading, Bingo.</p><p>"I am NOT calling you Mr. Plow." She chuckled, ruffling her wings as the tension eased in her shoulders. "Maybe Trish would."</p><p>The blush on my cheeks only served to make her laugh harder.</p><p>Our second trip through Little Troodon was far more fruitful, not only did people clear a path for me but those that didn't I could easily overpower. Have I ever mentioned how bizarre it is to be stronger than others? It's not something you really consider while lifting weights. Fang was practically my shadow, her head on a swivel to make sure no one snuck up on us. She kept a hand hooked onto my shoulder to make absolutely sure we'd never get separated in the crowds. With this new method, the trip to White Forest was a quick one, even on foot. Standing outside the front door I could see why it had the name, a row of white guitars stood in the display window. I guess if you squinted they looked a bit like tree's but it still felt like the owner was trying to force something a little too hard. For the first time in our trip, Fang loosened her grip on me. Wasting little time she opened the doors which played a guitar riff rather than the customary bell, cute idea.</p><p>"Well? You coming or what?" Fang asked, holding the door open for me. She looked considerably more relaxed now that we'd arrived.</p><p>Guess it was only fair she returned the favor, we shared a knowing smile before the two of us stepped into a rock stars paradise.</p><p>Past the white forest of White Forest there was still no shortage of guitars on display. I never really appreciated just how many shapes, sizes, and colors these things came in. From polished wood to lacquered plastic, from huge multi-fret behemoths to humble and plain. I didn't know any of this stuff and Fang wanted me to help out? I hope she was planning to do the heavy lifting. A pink ankylosaur with long, curly hair was manning the front, her attention already on us thanks to the door jingle.</p><p>"Hey you two! The name's Babs, what're you looking for today?" She asked with seemingly genuine interest rather than the usual customer service spiel.</p><p>"I'll be playing at Extinction Event, need something suitable for it," Fang answered with no small amount of pride, unable to keep a smile from her lips.</p><p>"Oh?" The woman's face lit up with a smile as well "You'll need our high-end stock then! Have anything specific in mind?"</p><p>Fang shot a questioning look my way, Oh no, was she really expecting me to offer actual advice?</p><p>"Uh, I think we should browse around."</p><p>She nodded as if I wasn't just stalling for time and looked back to the cashier, "You mind I practice with a few of them?" She asked, her eyes scanning the instruments along the walls with a critical eye.</p><p>"For the big spender? No problem!" Babs replied cheerily, pulling out a stool and reaching up for a teal guitar with two sharp curves along the body</p><p>"How about we start with the Fender Professional?" The woman said before she gingerly handed the instrument over the counter to Fang.</p><p>Big spender? Fang mentioned they were expensive before too, While Fang was tuning the guitar I couldn't help but glance at the prices labeled around. Most of these things were hundreds of dollars! Hell, the cheapest one was still a hundred! Didn't Fang have like three or four of these things in her old room? God damn was that one two thousand dollars!? Who had two thousand dollars to spend on a guitar!? How could it possibly be worth that much?</p><p>A warm melody brought my attention back to Fang, her fingers playing softly along the strings of the guitar. The song sounded surprisingly gentle, the same few notes repeating time and again.</p><p>"What do you think?" Fang asked me for confirmation, cocking her hip to strike a little pose with the guitar. The notes sounded incredibly rich but it's not like I had much experience with this kind of stuff. I haven't heard a guitar in person for years, let alone one of this quality. She was looking at me expectantly however, I needed to give at least some sort of feedback. Well, it's a bit shallow but...</p><p>"I don't really like the color, doesn't stand out enough from your feathers." I offered tentatively, unsure if she'd even care about the aesthetics.</p><p>Fang stared down at the tool in her hands as if just considering that angle for the first time.</p><p>"Huh, you're right." She shot me a smile and handed the instrument back to Babs almost immediately. "I need something to stand out on stage, good call."</p><p>Babs didn't seem very perturbed over the rejection, putting the Fender back and instead pulling out a double-headed monstrosity. What the hell was the point of those anyways?</p><p>"The Epiphone would certainly do the job!" She added cheerily, hefting what was surely heavy enough to be a lethal weapon over the counter.</p><p>Fittingly, when Fang's hand fell along that instrument it practically growled. Deep and nearly bassy, then Fang's hand swapped strings to the other fretboard, the beastly notes suddenly lost to airy and light tunes. Fang switched between the two as fast as her fingers would allow, clearly having fun with the disparity between them, challenging herself to create music with two extremes.</p><p>"That was excellent!" Babs clapped enthusiastically. "I'm definitely looking forward to seeing you at the festival for real."</p><p>Fang nodded politely at her but she must be waiting for my verdict. I tried to take an objective look at the thing even though Fang definitely looked like she was enjoying herself.</p><p>"Just seems a little much you know? The thing's massive and do you really need-"</p><p>Fang had already put the Epiphone back on the counter well before I finished</p><p>"I mean, you know I'm not an expert and you looked like you were having fun! Maybe you should-"</p><p>"Anon." Fang interrupted, turning to look at me while Babs was fishing for another guitar. "You realize where we are right?"</p><p>"A guitar shop?" I answered uncertainly.</p><p>Fang nodded, "exactly. This place is practically a candy store, I'm having fun with everything here." She glanced around at all the instruments on display, a small smile on her face. "I just need someone to keep me grounded, you're doing fine. Really."</p><p>"Alright, how about the Taylor? Not too big and plenty distinctive." Babs sounded pretty sure about this one.</p><p>Fang took the guitar into her hands, she definitely looked comfortable with it. The notes she chose to test with were familiar, even comforting. When her sample concluded she again shot me that questioning look, wondering what I saw that she couldn't see. Frankly, I didn't have much of anything for her, she looked good with the guitar and it sounded great.</p><p>"I dunno, seems fine I guess."</p><p>"Seems fine?" Fang asked, apparently surprised I actually had nothing bad to say.</p><p>When I shrugged, she handed the guitar back to Babs without a shred of hesitation.</p><p>"Wait, why? What was wrong with it?" I asked, even Babs seemed a little confused.</p><p>"You didn't have a strong opinion, that's worse than a bad one." Fang explained as if it were obvious.</p><p>Certainly one way to look at it I guess, Babs didn't immediately have a new guitar for us this time. I could understand the confusion, it's not like I gave good enough information that she could make informed decisions. Eventually she scoffed and turned around, hand on her hip.</p><p>"Alright, you seem to be the big deciding factor here. Why don't YOU recommend the guitar?" She grumbled, brushing her long hair behind an ear.</p><p>Well fuck. I don't know a god damned thing about guitars, how many times do I have to repeat that? I glanced around the store in apparent scrutiny as my mind scrambled to give me some kind of information. You've bullshitted your way through worse before, Anon. could I really just point to something and say 'that one'? Both Fang and Babs were waiting, I was taking long enough that I was going to need a really good response or end up with a really bad one. Shit, didn't I used to play that one game with the plastic guitar controllers? Come on brain, pull something!</p><p>"Les paul?" I blurted.</p><p>"A Gibson?" Babs helpfully added. "Bit old school but they're definitely my favorite, hold on."</p><p>Once the ankylosaur left, Fang shot me a grin. "Are you just trying to trick me into playing boomer rock?"</p><p>I blinked, did she actually remember that? I told her my taste in music half a decade ago in the briefest of conversations.</p><p>"Well, you wouldn't catch me complaining if a certain someone improved their taste" I shrugged nonchalantly.</p><p>Fang snorted, apparently that wasn't worth a reply. Babs returned not long after with a frankly beautiful guitar, The body itself had the gentle curves of a woman's hips while the color was a warm orange that bled into a red outline. When Fang took the instrument she actually paused and looked down at it, shaking her head as if she couldn't believe she was actually going to use it. Fang began her performance with the same simple notes that she did with the fender, Maybe it was just the visuals but it sounded even richer than before. The instrument in her hands practically hummed with the pluck of every chord.</p><p>Just as I was getting lulled into the lullaby, Fang picked up the pace, The tempo rising until those few notes had my toe-tapping. Fang's head was bobbing as her hand danced across the fretboard, she glanced up, her eyes meeting mine. Once she knew my attention was on her that hand on the fret exploded with speed as she clawed at the strings, Those once melodic notes were suddenly wailing at the command of their mistress. She shifted her foot, her shoulders hunched, her entire body moving to the music as she clawed at that guitar and made it scream symphony. It was good, really good, Fang must have thought so too because she could no longer contain herself to the simple rhythm, even as sped up as it was. No string was safe from the blur of her talons. By the time Fang had finished her solo, her shoulders heaved as she breathed deep. Did Fang get so into it that she forgot to breathe? The burning in my lungs reminded me that I must have too.</p><p>Fang looked down at the instrument with new appreciation, stretching her fingers after their work out. The ptero looked like a rock star straight out of legend with that guitar in hand, I suppose there was something to be said about the classics.</p><p>Babs whistle managed to break my attention from Fang, "Sounds like a winner to me."</p><p>"By far." I agreed, still appreciating just how impressive Fang looked with that guitar in hand. The orange was the same shade as her eyes, almost like someone made it for her.</p><p>"I'll take it." Fang agreed, still a little out of breath.</p><p>"Great!, the 50's Gibson model is a classic piece. Composed of mahogany, maple, rosewood..." Babs continued listing off the properties of the guitar but the specifics went through one ear and out the other for me. Fang seemed to understand whatever she was saying so that's all that really mattered. They had exchanged Jargon for so long I had nearly missed what Babs concluded with.</p><p>"That totals up to three thousand dollars, would you like a 24 month plan or 12?" She said unceremoniously</p><p>Three thousand!? You could buy a car for that! I'm pretty sure I'd seen commercials even!</p><p>"Maybe the Taylor then? That one was still pretty good." I tried reassuring Fang.</p><p>Except to my absolute and utter astonishment, Fang pulled out a block of cash. Not a credit card, paper fucking bills in a rubber band.</p><p>"Huh, you musicians never fail to surprise me." Babs chuckled as she took the money and started counting it out.</p><p>Yeah, understatement of the god damned century. Fang couldn't afford to feed herself properly what in the hell was she doing with that much money?</p><p>"Fang... Where did you get that?"</p><p>The ptero in question didn't even look at me, "The band pooled stuff together for this. It's important."</p><p>The band!? The band couldn't afford to buy Fang a pizza now and then but they could afford this!?</p><p>"Hey, Anon. It's past lunchtime, you mind grabbing us something to eat?" Fang asks casually like she didn't just spend months of rent and groceries.</p><p>I'd have worried she was reading my mind but I was feeling the gnawing in my stomach as well. I desperately wanted to argue more about this but maybe I was just overreacting. Maybe they sold some band equipment, maybe Thag or Claw were able to get a loan from somewhere. It really was their biggest show, It was probably worth it. With a nod to Fang, I walked out of White Forest and back into the crowded streets of Little Troodon. I was a little taller than most people which helped when I was trying to scan for food stands, usually you'd be able to smell them but there were so many in Lil' Tru' that the whole place sort of ambiently smelled of food. Despite that, I actually couldn't find a vendor anywhere. At least, anywhere within sight and I didn't really want to leave Fang stranded waiting for me. During my search the sun hit a stand just right and a glint beckoned to me.</p><p>More out of curiosity than anything I approached the stand, not like I could find food anyways. An utterly bizarre dinosaur was manning it, I couldn't even recognize what he was. His sweater had far too many buttons and his sunglasses were two different shades of colors. The poor guy was either a born cripple or managed to lose both his legs below the knee somewhere along the way, two metal prosthetics were supporting his weight. Somehow that wasn't the most bizarre thing of all, that was the snake puppet on his left hand.</p><p>"Fate... Destiny... fatestiny. People toss around those words like tennis balls." He was talking with his snake puppet, wonderful. "Well, I eat balls for breakfast, Perhaps you too hunger for the break of fast?"</p><p>I didn't even know how to begin answering that.</p><p>Rather than trying to parse that absolute nonsense, I found what called me here in the first place. An amber pendant, Inlaid in silver, I could feel myself smile when I realized it reminded me of a certain monochromatic weirdo. Grasping the pendant I rubbed my thumb across the smooth surface, it was all too easy to imagine Fang out on that stage with her amber guitar. Dangling from her neck was this necklace, sparkling in the stage lights just like her eyes. I let the pendant drop from my fingers, it was a cute thought but I was pretty sure Fang would just laugh if I offered her a goofy necklace like this. I chuckled when I remembered just how many necklaces Fang already had, she really didn't need one more.</p><p>Stepping away before I lost too many brain cells from merely being within this guy's vicinity I found myself browsing other stalls. That daydream I had with the pendant inspired me to find something for Fang. Her and the band were committed to this festival, that much was clear. If Fang was spending thousands to make her performance the best it could be then it was the least I could do to help out too. The problem was that I wasn't sure what I was looking for. Ignoring jewelry, wrist bands and other minor nonsense didn't leave me with much until the simplest possible option stuck out to me. Every time I had seen Fang she always looked just a little disheveled, in no small part thanks to her old clothes. Small problem, I didn't exactly know what size Fang wore.</p><p>While sifting through various clothes I stumbled upon something that just might work. Tastefully studded along the collar was a small, leather jacket. Small enough to fit her and big enough to grow into, what rock star went onto stage in jeans and a tank top anyways? Leather never went out of style! Purchasing the frankly exorbitantly expensive clothing didn't douse my spirits too much, my frame of reference for spending was a bit warped after the Les Paul. Thankfully it didn't take long to return to White Forest, jacket folded over my arm. Fang waiting outside the front doors with a new guitar case in hand. Guess I took longer than I thought.</p><p>"What, couldn't find someone selling food? No way." Fang crossed her arms but didn't actually sound that upset, probably still riding the high of her new instrument.</p><p>"Nah, Figured the superstar could use a home-cooked meal before they leave for the big time. My treat." Nice save, Anon.</p><p>"Trying to out cook the Lil' Tru' Vendors?" Fang smirked. "Good luck."</p><p>It was then that Fang noticed what I had on my arm, one of her thick eyebrows raising slightly but her smirk hadn't abated</p><p>"What's this? I don't think I'm hungry enough to eat leather yet."</p><p>"You got a big performance coming up, you gotta look the part!" I explained as I held the jacket out to her.</p><p>Fang handed me the case, unwilling to leave it unattended on the ground. Unfolding the jacket she gave it an appraising eye, back to front. After a thorough inspection, she lowered the jacket to reveal that her smirk had only widened.</p><p>"Anon, Do you see anything wrong with this?" She asks innocently.</p><p>"Uh..." I peered closer at the jacket, frankly, I thought it looked great. "No?"</p><p>Fang cleared her throat and ruffled her wings, the back of the jacket was facing me. Oh... Oh god damn it. The realization must have shown on my face because Fang was chuckling now.</p><p>"Don't worry, dweeb." Fang reached into her pocket and pulled out a switchblade. "I've got this."</p><p>Does she just carry that these days? I live on skin row and even I forgot to bring my knife, guess it came in handy this time. Slicing down the back of that expensive jacket hurt my soul but I guess it was worthless if Fang couldn't wear it. Thankfully the pain was over with quickly and Fang slid her new attire on. After tugging the sleeves and adjusting it around her wings she seemed satisfied. It was definitely a small jacket, her midriff would be completely exposed if she were wearing something more revealing. The jacket was just bulky enough to puff up her shoulders and arms a little, making her look less skinny. These were both minor things in all honesty, what really happened was the punk rock girl of my dreams found her missing piece. That jacket sat on her just as naturally as a guitar in her hands. Fang flexed the leather as she went through various poses trying to get a better look at herself, even turning around at one point. It was with no small amusement that I noticed her tail was wagging, I doubt she did that on purpose.</p><p>"So... How do I look?" She asked at last, The confidence she started with bleeding away into nervousness.</p><p>Her once gorgeous wings were ragged, her plumage had gotten paler than before leaving her ghostly, she was still too thin even for a skinny girl, the bags beneath her eyes were dark, her beautiful hair had been lost and only barely begun recovering, her voice had grown raspy over the years of smoking and she traded the makeup of her youth for a latticework of dark ink and symbols up and down her arms I didn't understand at all.</p><p>But then she smiled, and in her eyes, I could see the spark of that same girl from high school who was so excited to play at dino-moe's she practically tackled me. There was only one answer wasn't there? Even if she was going to hit me for it. I smiled back at her all the same.</p><p>"Like Fang."</p></div>
