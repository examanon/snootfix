<h1>Altered Paths - Nasera Chapter 2</h1><div><p>Chapter 2: Early Birds</p><p>​</p><p>Oh? Are you back for more of this story? How interesting. How very, very interesting…</p><p>Well, regardless, since you came back, Might as well continue telling this tale </p><p>Lucky for you, not much has happened since you last saw this reality. </p><p>After waking up from his nightmares, Anon went about another normal day of school. He saw his classmates as expected, and interacted with the girl that’s been causing him no end of confusion up till now. On top of that, he endured Trish’s grilling over what he and Nasera did the day prior when she led him down the hall, got his usual set of math answers from a still helpful Reeda, survived his science class and the sharp glares of an annoyed Fang, and generally made it through the rest of the day without further incident.</p><p>All in all, it seemed as if the rest of the week would go by uneventully, almost making the human believe that he had imagined the whole interaction with Nasera about the sports club. That knowledge was still a bit spot of confusion for the petite caveman. But can you blame him? It’s not every day that one of the most beautiful girls in school comes to you and asks you to join her club. </p><p>If only Anon knew what was in store for him…</p><p>Well, I’ve talked your ears enough as is. Why don’t we pick up this story in real-time?</p><p>Thursday Morning...</p><p>My phone’s sudden ring knocks right out of my slumber, almost causing me to roll over to the floor. </p><p>And I was having such a wonderful dream. </p><p>Trying to think back on the details of the dream leaves me with a bit of a blank mind. Fuck, waking up jumbled my memory. Still, it had to have been a nice dream due to the warm fuzzy feeling I still feel in my chest.</p><p>I try to ignore my phone’s ringing as best as I can. When it finally ceases, I adjust myself back into bed and prepare to go back to sleep. ‘Probably some fucking telemarketer,’ I think as I shut my eyes and get as comfy as I can.</p><p>Then the phone rings once more, forcing my eyes open yet again. </p><p>With a groan, I sit on the edge of my bed and snatch the phone from my nightstand. I let out an angry sigh and tap the answer button without looking at the caller ID, ready to curse out whoever was daring to wake me at such an early hour of the day.</p><p>“Look, whatever you’re selling, I’m not interested in it, especially this early in the morning!” I snap, ready to hang the call, when a familiar tone laughs from the other end of the line.</p><p>“I’m afraid to ask how often you get marketer calls if that’s how you answer your phone,” Nasera states in a far too cheerful tone for how early in the day it is. “Regardless, this is your wake-up call. Rise and shine, Mr. Mous. Rise and shine!” </p><p>I look over to the old and beat-up alarm clock next to my bed. Its red LED display reads that it’s a minute past five in the morning.</p><p>FIVE IN THE FUCKING MORNING!</p><p>“Nasera… it’s five in the morning. Why are you calling me this early?” A better question would be why she’s even calling a loser like me at all, but then I remember that Nasera doesn’t seem to follow the norms of a school system. You know, the system where the loser nobodies stay in the bottom and get trampled on by the popular perfect paragons of society. I was the loser, of course, and Nasera was the paragon. </p><p>The fact alone that she even acknowledged my existence baffled my mind to no end…</p><p>“Oh, I know it’s five!” Nasera chirps in a too excited tone. “And you should be thankful too. I let you sleep an extra hour!”</p><p>‘She let me sleep in an hour?’ I muse, my brain incapable of understanding how someone could wake up at such early hours. I’m so baffled that I almost miss Nasera’s following words.</p><p>“Humans are diurnal, right? Don’t you guys get up at the crack of dawn to get in a good day’s hunt and gathering, or am I confusing it with nocturnalism?”  </p><p>‘W...what?’ I think, not quite sure what to make of Nasera’s comment. </p><p>On the one hand, she’s right about humans and daytime activity. On the other hand, why is she even bringing it up in the first place? Also, hunting and gathering? That doesn’t make any sense...</p><p>A part of me is very tempted to snap back at Nasera with facts to correct her ignorant views on humans, but then I remember that she’s not exactly an expert when it comes to human-dino interactions to begin with. I don’t think anyone in Volcaldera Bluffs is.</p><p>I let out a sigh and eat it for now. “Yes, humans are daytime active,” I confirm with Nasera, biting a tongue that wants to add a ‘but’ to that statement. “Still doesn’t change the fact that we don’t wake up before the sun’s even risen over the horizon!” </p><p>“Oh, quit your whining, Anon. It’s not winter yet, so you have no excuse to hibernate,” Nasera snaps with a bit of annoyance in her tone. “You’re part of the sports club. That means you have to be an early bird from now on. You know, like in the old saying? The early bird catches the—crap, what was it again? Something about a bug?”</p><p>“Uh, you mean ‘worm’?”</p><p>“Yes! Worm!” Nasera confirms. “Early birds get the worms!”</p><p>“Alright then, I’ll start getting ready,” I say once again, readying myself to end the call and start the longest morning of my life so far.</p><p>“Wonderful! I should be there to pick you up in fourteen minutes!” </p><p>Nasera’s words dispel the last of my grogginess and almost make me jump out of bed.</p><p>“W-WHAT!?” I end up shouting loud enough that I’m sure the upstairs tenants got jolted awake themselves.</p><p>“Geez, don’t shout my earholes out, Anon,” Nasera says with some hints of annoyance. “I said that I’d be there to pick you up in fifteen minutes,” she repeats with a surprising amount of patience in her voice.</p><p>“H-how?” I stammer out, not caring if I sound like I’m having some kind of aneurysm.</p><p>“I have a car,” Nasera says flatly, though with a few hints of amusement in her tone. “You know, a mechanical carriage that has wheels—which I’m sure your people invented way back in the day— and uses fuel to get people places in a hurry? Can blow up if mishandled too much?”</p><p>I again fight the urge to snap at Nasera for her oh-so-casual belittlement of my intellect and instead focus on the main thing she’s trying to tell me. </p><p>For some ungodly reason, Volcano High’s paragon of sporty perfection is coming over to my place, of her own accord, to pick my ass up and take me to school, at dawn of all times...</p><p>My brain’s about to bluescreen trying to take in all the information I’m trying to process at the same time. </p><p>I almost end up missing Nasera’s following words.</p><p>“Anon? Did you hear me? I said to please try to be ready in fifteen. I don’t want to stick around Skin Row and risk getting mugged, shanked, dino-napped, or all three at the same time.”</p><p>I blink and shake my head to try and dispel the stupid as I find myself agreeing with Nasera on her fears about Skin Row. My neighborhood isn’t the best place for a hot chick like her to hang around.</p><p>“So hurry up! Because if something happens to me, my dad’s going to mount your head on his trophy wall, and I’d very much hate having to live with that on my conscience.”</p><p>Without another word, I hang up the call and kick myself out of bed. I can hardly believe what I got done hearing. I pinch myself to ensure I’m not having another dream like the one I had a day ago. When I fail to snap awake in a sweat again, I realize that I’m not dreaming, and that the situation unfolding before me is very, very real.</p><p>A girl is coming over to my place. A hot girl. A REALLY hot girl who’s also the president of the sports club; a club I joined two days earlier…</p><p>Wasting no more time on idle thoughts, I peel off and hit the shower first. I don’t even bother using much soap since I have very little body. I spend less than five minutes washing before I’m flying right out and putting on my usual jeans, worn-out casual shoes, white shirt, and green linen shirt. I stuff my phone into my pocket and shove all my books and other school materials into my backpack without caring how they wind up inside. I’ll worry about organizing my crap when I’m not on the clock. I then run to my kitchen and reach for the most portable food I can get my hands on, that being two paltry and almost tasteless granola bars. Kind of wish I could have a bigger breakfast, but I get the feeling that even cereal’s something I can’t finish in less than five minutes.</p><p>Just as I finish stuffing the last of the granola into my gullet, my phone buzzes. I reach into my pocket and pull out the device, looking over at the new message that got sent to me:</p><p> </p><p>[Nasera]</p><p>Outside. </p><p>Hurry plz. </p><p>Place gives me the creeps!</p><p>I sling my backpack over my shoulder and rush out of my apartment, making sure to lock up the place nice and tight before flying down the stairs and out into the cold and dark morning air. As I do, I can’t help but ask myself a few questions about my current situation. </p><p>How did I get here? Was someone playing some kind of joke on me? How does Nasera know where I live? </p><p>Memories of my old life back in Rock Bottom and the doxing incident come to mind. Did someone leak my new address? Do I have to transfer schools again?</p><p>Fuck. I hate feeling so out of the loop here. Have to ask Nasera what the hell’s going on as soon as I see her...</p><p>The instant I step out of my apartment building, I’m greeted by my future club president, who waves me over to what I assume is her car, though I have to do a double-take because it doesn’t look like something she’d be driving in the first place.</p><p>Nasera’s ride looks to be some kind of muscle car. It has that whole ‘high schooler trying to show off’ vibe going for it, yet at the same time, it also looks to be far more functional than showy. Yet, the one aspect that sticks out to me the most is that the vehicle has this horizontal split in the middle. One half looks pristine—right out of the dealership even—while the other half looks disheveled and worn, paint chipping in some parts, and with a small crack near the driver’s side of the windshield.</p><p>It’s… a unique style. I wonder for a second if its on purpose... </p><p>I take one final look at Nasera’s car before rushing forward, opening the door, and taking my seat in the passenger side. As I do, I can’t help but feel uneasy. Here I am getting into the car of someone I had befriended a little over a week ago. Said person I had befriended also happened to be among the top most attractive people in all Volcano High. The only other girl that came close to matching Nasera’s natural beauty was that Stacey girl, and she was head cheerleader.</p><p>Oh god. Since I’m going to be doing the whole sports thing, I’m going to be seeing a hell of a lot more of Stacey too, aren't I? ‘Fuck. I’m going to be spilling spaghetti everywhere I go...’</p><p>“Uh…” Nasera says, snapping me out of my thoughts. “Spaghetti is a good source of carbs, but I think it’s too early to be thinking about eating it. That’s more of a lunch and dinner meal!.”</p><p>Fuck. Mumbling. Have to keep a lid on that shit from now on…</p><p>“Anyway,” Nasera says as she pulls away from the curb and gets the car rolling. “Good morning! Hope you slept well last night!”</p><p>Almost as if on cue, I let out a yawn, cutting off whatever words I had planned on saying. Not my intended message, but the act still got across how early I felt it was.</p><p>Nasera rolls her eyes and puts on a warm simper. “I know it’s hard at first, but you’ll get used to this schedule soon enough. Though I do suggest you hit the hay at least two hours earlier from now on. Gotta make sure you get at least seven hours of sleep. Or was it eight?” She taps a finger on her chin in contemplation. “Well, I’m sure seven to eight hours is more than enough for most humans!” The ptero cheers in too sugary a voice for me to think it one-hundred percent earnest. </p><p>I roll my eyes at Nasera’s suggestion. ‘Sleep two hours earlier? But that means I’ll miss out on prime shitposting time. How am I supposed to get all those (you)s if I’m dozing off while everyone gets online?’ I think to myself in a bit of annoyance.</p><p>Nasera lets out a small chuckle, almost as if in reply to my thoughts. “There’s that word again. ‘Shitposting.’ I still don’t know what it means, but it sounds… interesting...”</p><p>My cheeks burn a bit as I again berate myself for not keeping my mumbling in check. Thinking fast, I let out a chuckle of my own and try to play the situation cool as ice. “Yeah… it’s not that important. I’ll… explain it later. Much, much later…” Yeah, so much later, in fact, that it’ll probably be around the time of the heat-death of the universe...</p><p>Soon enough, I notice a change in the surrounding buildings. Gone are the commie-style public housing blocks or the dilapidated buildings speaking of years of neglect and general urban decay. We pass by some industrial zones, and soon enough, it feels like we are in the suburbs, the housing getting fancier with each street we drive through.</p><p>Nasera lets out a huge sigh. She seems to lose some of the tension in her body as she lets herself slump a bit on her seat. “Finally, we’re out of that shithole,” she says in a harsh tone that, if I’m being honest, does not befit the ptero one bit. </p><p>“No offense, Anon, but your neighborhood’s... crappy. The worst place to live in all Volcaldera. Though, it explains why you have to rely on the school’s lunch card...”</p><p>Okay, that one feels like a straight-up slap to the face. I almost lose the fight keeping my emotions and the comments that come with them bottled up. Nasera’s words sting all the harder because I know she’s right, and that fact makes me feel all the more embarrassed about my living situation. Not like I have a choice in the matter. My whole move to Volcaldera was a last-minute thing, and I’m sure it only happened because Spears pulled some kind of convoluted paperwork loophole. Not to mention that I was never well-off to start. </p><p>There’s a reason my hometown’s called ‘Rock Bottom...’</p><p>I let go of whatever resentment is bubbling in me, as well as my desire to educate the dino driving me to school as I instead focus on a much more important question, one that NEEDS answering…</p><p>“Nasera,” I start, keeping my tone as deadpan as I can despite the maelstrom of emotions raging within me. “How and why do you know my home address?” </p><p>Nasera puts on a big broad grin as if she’s pretty proud of some accomplishment. “I memorized it from your forms while Naomi and Principal Spears finalized your paperwork!” she chirps out her answer innocently enough. Not sure if that puts me at ease or makes me feel all the more uneasy. I’m pretty sure that what Nasera did counts as a violation of privacy laws.</p><p>Before I can voice my displeasure over the mild level of doxing on her part, Nasera’s expression grows serious. “I know what you’re thinking, Anon. I shouldn’t have access to this information. That it must be some kind of violation of your privacy.”</p><p>D-did I mumble again? Is Nasera reading my mind!?</p><p>“Rest assured, I’m only allowed to know such personal information because I’m the president of the sports club. Your address and medical records are crucial info for me to have on hand in case of an emergency.”</p><p>See, I can understand having my medical information on hand. Sports are taxing and dangerous. But my address too? What does that have to do with it?</p><p>“I understand your concern over me knowing something so personal, but I can assure you that the only people who know this info right now are myself, Naomi, and Principal Spears.”</p><p>Principal Spears knowing my address makes total sense. He’s the principal of Volcano High, after all. But Naomi? Why does she have to know that? Fuck, being class president comes with some unspoken perks, doesn’t it? </p><p>That’s still total bullshit. But well, whatever. At least only three people know that I live in absolute squalor. That’s at least a hell of a lot less than back in Rock Bottom.</p><p>I try looking at the positives of my current situation. Nasera seems like she’s professional enough to keep her mouth shut about my living conditions. It’s embarrassing as hell, but she’s at least not Trish, who I know for a fact would LOVE to run her mouth about how I live one step away from literal homelessness. </p><p>Naomi, despite how annoying she can be with her sugary disposition that I know for a fact is a front for something shady, also seems to be a professional. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be the class president. They don’t give that job out to anyone.  </p><p>Aside from that, there’s also the fact that I’m getting a free lift to School. Sure, I had to get up almost two hours earlier than usual, but this beats having to haul my ass four miles through Skin row to get to a proper bus station. </p><p>That did bring up an important question, though. If Nasera wants me to get up so early from now on, does that mean I’d have to walk through Skin Row at such early hours of the morning? Wouldn’t that be as bad as walking through those forsaken streets at night?</p><p>Fuck. Just when I thought I could coast by without having to carry a knife on my person…</p><p>I divert those thoughts away by asking myself what we’d be doing so early in school. Obviously, it's going to be something sports-related, but what exactly? Was it considered a meeting? Were there going to be other people already waiting there for us too?</p><p>A very jerky turn of the car derails all my thoughts and makes me realize that, holy shit, Nasera’s flying through the streets at almost sixty miles an hour! I’m sure I make some kind of sound because the one-winted ptero lets out a satisfied giggle.</p><p>“Ah, I love driving around town early in the morning!” she exclaims as she makes yet another sharp turn, which makes my stomach lurch a bit from the suddenness. “No traffic, no pedestrians, and all the lights seem to be green. Really lets me cut loose and drive without any worries!”</p><p>‘Yeah… I’m pretty sure traffic laws aren’t a suggestion, Nasera,’ I end up thinking but not voicing as intended. Though, with my mumbling problem, I’m pretty sure I end up saying it out loud anyway. Nasera gives no response though, so I assume she’s too engrossed with her driving that’s just one level shy of being something out of a stock car race to care... </p><p>One benefit of Nasera’s speedy and reckless disregard of most road laws short of vehicular man/dino slaughter is that it only takes her fifteen minutes to reach Volcano High. That has to be some kind of record. </p><p>The first thing I notice as Nasera parks her car in the back of the school is how the sun’s nothing more than a few rays of gold on the horizon that barely peek past the mountainous terrain of Dinofornia. The second thing is how eerily empty the school appears so early in the day. If I had once thought the school looked like something out of a Doom wad during the day, the pre-sunrise darkness made it appear like something straight out of Silent Hill. </p><p>Now that’s a thought that’s rather horrible to consider, getting stuck in a school while some horror-type shit happens. Would make for a great story though. Didn't I read something similar not that long ago? </p><p>Nasera and I disembark without a word. I’m not even outside my captain’s car for more than a second before she taps me in the shoulder and motions me to follow. I do, and she leads me into the backmost part of the school, right where the fields and the gym are.</p><p>We stop in front of the gym building, but rather than going through the main entrance, Nasera leads me to the side of the building, right up to a door I assumed led to some kind of supply closet. Before I’m even able to ask her how she plans to get the door open, she reaches for her keys and picks out a worn, nondescript one from the few she has on her key ring, which she then uses to open the door without any real issues.</p><p>I have to remind myself that she has those keys because of her position as captain of the sports club.</p><p>Once more, Nasera motions for me to follow her. I do so cautiously. Maybe it’s my paranoid side talking, but it kind of feels like I’m walking into some kind of trap, and I’m about to get knocked out before some insidious school cult harvests my organs. Of course, when the lights come on, I’m only met with an empty hall. </p><p>Me and my silly fears. I really do watch too much fucking anime...</p><p>We walk a bit more, and then we finally exit into the gymnasium proper. And I can’t help but be impressed. Rock Bottom High’s gymnasium has nothing on Volcano High’s. The court looks so well-maintained and shiny that I can almost see my reflection on it, and the benches look state of the art. They even have cushions on them, ensuring maximum comfort for any spectators. What’s more, the gym’s so large that it feels as if it houses two entire courts instead of one.</p><p>“Hey, don’t get too distracted now,” Nasera tells me, likely taking notice of me ogling my surroundings. She instead once again motions for me to follow. By now, I’m not sure where else the ptero can be leading me. I get an answer soon enough when she holds open another door at the other end of the gym, leading into yet another hallway, one that I recognize this time, as it’s the route leading to the boys and girls locker rooms. Our destination is neither, as she leads me further down the hall, towards what I recognize as one of the offices.</p><p>Nasera again uses her key to open the door to that office space, the light flicking active as soon as she takes a single step inside. I follow Nasera in. As I do, the first thing that strikes me is the fact that the office is quite messy. There are papers strewn over the table, and sports equipment lies haphazardly placed in shelves and racks. There appears to be some kind of ball pile in a far corner, and for some strange reason that eludes me altogether, the King Rex costume hangs on the wall, waiting for someone to don him and bring merriment to all students and staff alike.</p><p>Now that I give it some thought, Volcano High having a dinosaur for a mascot is like Rock Bottom High having a caveman for a mascot…</p><p>“Sorry about the mess,” Nasera apologizes, snapping me out of whatever train of thoughts I was having. “I haven’t had much time to clean up last semester’s mess.”</p><p>I don’t mind the mess too much. If anything, it kinda reminds me of my old room back in Rock Bottom. If nothing else, it brings a tiny bit of nostalgia to me, making my current situation not feel as strange as it would otherwise be.</p><p>“I have something for you. Hold on a sec!” Nasera announces as she walks into what looks like a supply room in the back of the office. Seconds later, the ptero comes out holding what appears to be a tracksuit, one that’s colored white and red. On top of the folded clothes are a pair of sturdy high-top running shoes, also colored red and white, though more on the red side.</p><p>Nasera hands me the clothes and shoes, all the while smiling. “Took me all yesterday, but I managed to find you some clothes fitting your exact measurements,” she starts, all the while glowing with pride. “Had to pay our school supplier a direct visit and wait for them to make your clothes from scratch. It turns out that they don’t make outfits for non-dinos, so I guess you can consider your new digs completely custom!”</p><p>I’m lost for words. </p><p>On the one hand, I can’t help but feel a bit pampered by all the attention. Then again, if what Nasera told me is true, me being the first-ever human to join the sports club makes me pretty damn unique. At least unique enough that getting custom clothes isn’t out of the question. I just find it difficult to accept everything...</p><p>“Go on, try ‘em on!” Nasera encourages, the smile on her lips not once wavering in its radiance.</p><p>With no way to come up with an excuse not to, I grip the clothes in my hands and head out of the office, down the hallway, and right into the boy’s locker room. It doesn’t take me long to find my assigned locker for PE class. </p><p>Over the next five minutes, I input the code after double-checking the note I made for myself on my phone, put on my new digs while stuffing my old clothes into the locker, and slip on my new shoes, making sure the laces are tight, and the straps secure.</p><p>I give myself a careful look over. As I do, I can’t help but smile at how comfortable the new outfit feels on me. I don’t know what kind of material the tailor used, but it sure as heck doesn’t feel like your run-of-the-mill cotton. The fabric breathes far too well, and it’s so smooth against my skin that it almost feels like I’m not wearing anything at all. What’s more, the new shoes are the most comfortable pair I’ve ever worn. The soles are soft, the size is perfect, and the straps make them feel secure and airtight, almost feeling as if they somehow have become a part of my foot. </p><p>The new gear feels so lovely and so comfortable that I'm considering ditching my old outfit and making this my go-to from now on. Then I remember the outfit’s only for club use, and some of my happiness evaporates. </p><p>That line of thought sobers me up, filling me with some of the doubts I’ve been having since first agreeing to join the club. A part of me still wants to find some way to get out of it. But how can I when Nasera’s so friendly and accommodating? She even got me brand new clothes for Raptor Jesus’ sake. Would quitting also mean I have to pay for the new digs and shoes out of pocket? </p><p>A Knock on the door to the locker room snaps me out of my thoughts. I stuff the last of my belongings into my locker and step outside. Soon as I do, Nasera greets me. She herself looks very different from a few minutes ago. Whereas before she was wearing her usual white shirt and tight red pants, she’s now wearing what looks like a pair of super short and super tight volleyball shorts, a red and white varsity jacket with the school’s logo emblazoned on the upper left side, a knee brace, and a red and white sweatband wrapped around her forehead.</p><p>She looks stunning. I’m not going to lie...</p><p>“So, how are the new clothes?” Nasera asks.</p><p>“They feel great!” I reply with far more enthusiasm than I even expected to voice. “I don’t think I’ve ever worn something that feels so soft, breathes so well, yet feels so sturdy.”</p><p>“Glad you like it,” Nasera replies with a smile. “Our school uniforms are made out of one-hundred percent Egyptian cotton!”</p><p>That’s… a pretty fucking high percentage. It explains why it feels so good, though. It also answers my question about the price should I decide to quit the club later.</p><p>One more reason to stick around, I guess.</p><p>“Come with me,” Nasera says as she grabs me by the shoulder and drags me down the hall and into a small kitchen area, one that looks almost like a teacher’s lounge, except more sparse. Before asking my future club captain what we’re doing in the kitchen, she walks up to one of the many counters and brings out a blender. She plugs the device on the nearest outlet and again turns to the counters. Seconds later, she brings out an almost comically large white tub full of some kind of white powder, which she sets on the countertop before moving to the nearby fridge and taking out a carton of almond milk and some pre-sliced fruit.</p><p>Once she has set all the ingredients on the counter, Nasera turns to face me. “One or two scoops?”</p><p>I don’t know how to answer whatever Nasera’s asking me, so I end up saying the first thing that pops into my head. “T-two scoops,” I stammer out.</p><p>Nasera nods and smiles. “Four scoops it is then!” she proclaims before opening the tub of white powder and scooping out four pretty seizable cups of what I can only assume has to be some kind of protein powder. By the time’s she’s finished scooping, almost half of the blender’s full of the stuff. She then proceeds to pour at least five cups of almond milk and the sliced fruit into the blender before closing the top and activating the device.</p><p>While the blender works its magic on the ingredients, Nasera turns back to face me. “You’ve already told me that you really like the new clothes. What about the shoes? Do they feel nice as well?”</p><p>I nod enthusiastically. “Shoes feel so great, I think I’m going to use ‘em as my new footwear from now on. It’ll sure make getting to school so much easier in the mornings.”</p><p>Nasera turns off the blender, all the while still keeping her eyes on me. “So you’ve been walking to school this whole past week and a half?”</p><p>“Not like I have a choice,” I say, my mood souring a bit. “Gotta walk through Skin Row to take a proper bus.”</p><p>“But don’t buses run in and around Skin Row too?”</p><p>“They do, but they’re pretty… dangerous. Most of the time, they’re hobo hotels on wheels. If I took one, I’d probably wind up getting mugged, shanked, kidnapped, or all the above at the same time.”</p><p>Nasera blinks a few times, very clearly processing my words. “How far do you walk to take a bus then?”</p><p>“I’ve… honestly never given it much thought, but it takes me about an hour to get from my apartment to a bus station that’s safe and brings me across the street from Volcano High. According to my phone’s pace keeper, I do about four miles an hour, so…” I give Nasera a nonchalant shrug. “I guess I walk four miles every morning?”</p><p>Nasera pours two cups of the protein shake she finished preparing. She then hands me a cup, her expression one I can only describe grim. “Well... As captain of the Sports Club, I can't let my newest member risk his safety just to be a part of morning jogs!”</p><p>“I mean, it’s not that bad. Honestly. I just gotta be real careful where I walk and make sure I stay on the well-lit sides of the streets.”</p><p>“See, that’s the problem!” Nasera exclaims, all the while her brow furrows. “Like, did you know that despite only making up about twenty percent of Volcaldera Bluff’s population, skinnies make up more than eighty percent of all reported crime, the majority coming from Skin Row and Little Troodon?” The ptero shivers, not sure if in disgust or fear. “And you live right in the middle of Skin Row!” My future club captain looks me in the eye with what I can only describe as worried determination. “That crap ISN’T going to fly with me! So from now on, I’m picking you up from your apartment at five sharp!”</p><p>Before I can form some kind of protest to Nasera’s pretty ridiculous command, she raises a hand. “I don’t wanna hear any ‘buts.’ Only ‘yes ma'am.’ Got it?”</p><p>I swallow hard and nod in reply. That seems to be a good enough Answer for Nasera, who gulps down her protein shake in one single swig before letting out a satisfied sigh. “Now then. Since you say you’ve already been walking four miles daily for the last week, I’m going to start us off with a nice two-mile jog. Drink your shake and meet me on the field!”</p><p>Before I can even form words on my tongue, Nasera walks past me, all the while smiling with a great deal of contentment. I can only stare at the ptero’s hips sway with a hypnotizing allure, said allure amplified by her booty shorts. </p><p>The sight only makes the neurons in my brain start firing off enthusiastically…</p><p>To keep my… primal thoughts in check, I chug down my protein shake. I expect the drink to taste like absolute shit. Instead, I taste what has to be best god-dam protein shake I’ve ever had the pleasure of drinking in my life. My joy at the taste is such that I can’t help but compare it to some kind of elixir. </p><p>I put down the now empty cut on the counter and rush out of the office and towards the field as Nasera instructed. As I get my legs moving, I can’t help but feel a sudden rush of energy overtaking my body. I don’t know if it’s the protein shake or the sudden rush of endorphins at the sight of Nasera’s hot bod, but something’s filling me with energy, and it fucking feels amazing.  </p><p>When I reach Nasera out on the field, I find her doing stretches. She stops the instant she sees me and smiles. “Oh hey, good timing! Wanna join me on the stretches?”</p><p>I pause in my tracks and think about what Nasera’s asking me to do. I’ve never done anything that’s remotely physically demanding, so I know almost shit when it comes to doing proper stretches. Something tells me that if I refuse, my muscles are going to make me regret the decision.</p><p>I stand next to Nasera and begin trying mirror her movements. Unfortunately, my inexperience gets the better of me me, and I pull too hard in places and wind up giving myself cramps. I fall over, barely keeping myself from shouting out in pain. </p><p>Thankfully, Nasera is there to stretch my leg out, which makes the worst of the pain vanish. She then helps me back up and gives me a raised eyebrow look. “You… uh… want me to teach you some proper stretching techniques?”</p><p>Already feeling my face grow warm from that particular embarrassment and fearing that if I try again, I’m going to give myself another cramp, I nod in reply.</p><p>Thankfully, Nasera doesn’t laugh in my face as she should. She only giggles a bit as she begins to patiently guide me through proper stretching techniques, many of which I hadn’t ever seen until now. After ten minutes, we both finish the warm-ups, and it makes me feel so much more limber than before. </p><p>How the hell had I gone so long in my life without doing proper stretches?</p><p>With the stretches out of the way, Nasera tosses me a bottle of water before giving me a quick rundown on some jogging techniques. I listen as she explains how I have to inhale through my nose and never through my mouth, how I should only take small sips of water when thirsty and never drink more than that while jogging less I make myself sick, how I have to make sure the ball of my feet and the toes aren’t parallel when my foot hits the ground, how I have to keep my posture upright at all times and always keep my eyes ahead, and of course that I shouldn’t slouch or less lose a lot of stamina.</p><p>Quite a lot to keep in mind for something so simple looking as jogging. Then again, very few things in life are simple if you stop to think about it…</p><p>“Oh, and one more thing,” Nasera says as she takes her position on the field. “don’t be afraid to slow down if you feel you’re running out of stamina. Better to set a slower pace than stopping altogether.”</p><p>I nod and walk out to the field myself. For the first time this morning, I feel like I’m ready to make the most out of something fitness-related.</p><p>That’s a very odd thing for me to think now that I stop to ponder it. It almost feels like some doppelganger is replacing me. Who am I, and what have I done with the real Anon?  </p><p>Ignoring that last stupid thought, I give Nasera another smile and a nod of confirmation. She brings out her phone and activates the jogging app on it. “We’re going for two miles. If we can keep up a pace of four miles an hour, we should finish in about twenty or so minutes. Maybe less.” She puts her phone back into the pocket of her jacket and looks me in the eye. “Ready to go?”</p><p>“Yup,” I say a bit absentmindedly as, for the first time since meeting Nasera, I notice how beautiful her amber-toned eyes are…</p><p>“Then GO!” Nasera announces as she takes off jogging.</p><p>By the time my brain can process the event, Nasera’s already a good dozen feet ahead and only getting further. </p><p>Wasting not another second, I order my legs to start moving, and in less than a second, I too am jogging right behind my club captain.</p><p>Even though I give it my best, my jogging speed isn’t up to par with Nasera’s. Unless I start sprinting, I’m destined to keep at least a good dozen feet away from the ptero, who seems to enter into a trance as her breathing evens out with her footfalls, creating a level of synchronicity that makes her every move as efficient as it is mesmerizing.</p><p>If I weren’t actively jogging myself, I would have sat down on the bench to stare in absolute awe at Nasera’s physical prowess...</p><p>The rays of sunlight hit my eyes the instant that ball of burning gas peeks over the mountains. With the light comes the warmth, and with the heat comes more sweat. I still haven’t gotten used to the temperature shifts in Volcaldera Bluffs. It’s not like back home, where the high altitude and mountainous terrain meant it was cool most of the time, if not outright freezing. </p><p>Nasera long finished running her two miles. I double my efforts despite the burning in my lungs. In comparison, I still have about another lap to go before saying my jog’s done. It puts into perspective how out of shape I am.</p><p>I focus on nothing but jogging. That helps me complete my task, though because of my doubled efforts and the fact that I started breathing through my mouth near the end, Feels like I’m about to pass out both from a lack of oxygen and the burning in my throat. Still, aside from that final push, Nasera’s advice about nose breathing did help keep my momentum up. Develop a bit more discipline when it comes to breathing, and I can see myself getting used to this whole track thing.</p><p>As I try and catch my breath, I can’t help but have my eyes wander a bit towards Nasera’s plum hips and rear, her booty shorts once again doing me no favors when it comes to their appeal to my baser primate instincts. What’s worse, now that we’re both nice and sweaty, I can’t help but catch a whiff of her post-workout musk...</p><p>I don’t know if it’s my testosterone feeling high after the workout, the endorphins making me feel all high and mighty, or if there’s some truth to the whole ‘tomboy aroma’ thing I’ve read so much about in various online forums, but I can’t deny there’s something… alluring… about Nasera’s post-workout scent. It’s honestly making it very hard to keep a party from starting inside my trousers...</p><p>I shake my head and ignore the thoughts going through my mind. No easy task considering the kind of beauty that’s standing a few feet away from me, though. God, I wasn’t such a lame example of my species. I’d walk right up to Nasera and… and…</p><p>I don’t finish those thoughts as I notice, much to my horror, that Nasera’s walking right towards me. </p><p>“Good job on the jog!” the ptero cheers as she closes the distance between us and pats me on the shoulder. “With that, you’ve taken your first step into the wonderful world of fitness!” she says, all the while giving me the widest, warmest smile yet.</p><p>Nasera’s words were nothing short of encouraging, yet something about them made me feel a bit uneasy. A part of me still feels strange about becoming so embroiled in a world that I have tried to avoid for so long. But as I look at Nasera’s warm smile and let her words sink into my being, I begin to feel something in my heart that I don’t think I’ve ever really experienced before, a fluttery sensation that fills me with a sense of self-worth that makes me feel like I’m worth a damn for the first time in my life...  </p><p>Nasera reaches for her cellphone and grimaces. “I was hoping we’d have time to do some cool-down exercises, but we have about ten minutes before the football team, and cheer squad kicks us out of the field.”</p><p>“Isn’t the football team a part of the sports club?”</p><p>“They used to be, but they broke off and became their own department a year before I started attending Volcano High. They do their own thing nowadays and have quite the rivalry with our club.” Nasera lets out a sigh as she again motions for me to follow. “Let’s hit the showers and call it for now. We’ll resume the workouts in the afternoon with the other members of the club.” Before we reach the building, Nasera turns around and gives me another smile. “Oh, and before I forget, meet me back in the office after you’re all done. Have to do a brief debrief.”  </p><p>I’m not sure why Nasera wants to debrief me, but I don't argue with her. Probably more information about the afternoon meeting.</p><p>God, it feels weird thinking that. I again have to ask myself what I’m doing and where this is taking me...</p><p>I down the last of my water and head straight for the showers. As I do, I start to notice a few students already filtering into the locker rooms. They don’t seem to see me, but I see them and their almost larger-than-life profiles. It doesn’t take me much to realize they have to be a part of the football team.</p><p>Jesus, how the fuck can you be in high school and still be that big…?</p><p>I jump into the shower, do what I need to do to stop smelling like sweat and grime, and slip on my regular clothes, stuffing my new club uniform into the locker. After some consideration, I look down at my old shoes and stuff them into the locker as well. </p><p>Thank you for all your years of service, but it’s time you guys got a nice long break...</p><p>With that done, I head for the office and meet up with Nasera, who is also back to wearing her usual clothes. </p><p>“Oh hey, that was fast!” Nasera chirps, taking a seat on her desk. “Might have already told you, but you did really well for your first morning jog. I think you might be ready to increase the length to four miles!”</p><p>“Uh, let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” I tell Nasera with an uneasy grin. “I still struggled a bit towards the end. Fucked up and started breathing through my mouth, which is why I was so out of breath by the time I finished.”</p><p>“Oh,” Nasera exclaims with genuine surprise. “I… didn’t really notice that. Though now that you mention it, that would explain why you were looking all addled back there.”</p><p>“Yeah… let’s go with that,” I say before letting out a single chuckle. “If I had to describe the jog itself thought, I’d say it was…”</p><p>Was it… great? Wonderful, even? Is that the right word I’d use to describe it? I mean, I don’t have much in the way of reference when it comes to it. Yet, at the same time, the feelings of gratification that I got after finishing is something that I can’t describe but understand all too well as wholly positive.</p><p>“It was amazing,” I end up saying as sincerely as I can manage to make my voice sound. “Oh, and the protein shake before it was also pure bliss!” I say, subconsciously licking my lips.</p><p>“You liked the shake that much?” Nasera asks, her eyes widening and her cheeks growing rosy.</p><p>I nod in reply. “Best protein shake I’ve ever drunk! What’s the brand? I wanna get some for myself. I’ma drink it every day before our meetings!”  </p><p>My own words cause me to pause. Wasn’t I thinking about finding some way to quit the club not that long ago? Was a single jogging session all it took to get me onboard? I mean, it wasn’t even an official meeting. More of a trial run...</p><p>Nasera lets out a giggle and looks to the side, her cheeks now very obviously glowing red. “The… the protein powder I use is homemade…” She turns back to face me with a big broad grin on her lips. “I-I’m glad… that you like it so much…” she stammers out a bit, all the while she fidgets a bit with her hands. “...If you want… I-I can share the recipe with you… B-but…” My club captain looks me in the eyes with determination. “I’ll only share the recipe with you if you promise to give it your absolute best in the coming months!”</p><p>I once again find myself asking whether I plan to stay on in Nasera’s sports club. Am I ready to commit to something so big so soon? As cheesy as it sounds, my decision could very well have repercussions for my future. Granted, they can very well be GOOD repercussions, but I don’t know that. Not yet anyway... </p><p>Before either myself or Nasera can get out another word, My phone alarm goes off, one I had forgotten I’d set as a secondary in case my bedside alarm stopped working for whatever reason. </p><p>I look at my device’s display and see that it’s now 7:00. This would be around the time when I’m waking up and going through my morning routine before flying out of the house, hopefully before 7:30. From there, the four-mile flight to the bus station followed. If all went well, I was usually at school a little before 8:45, which gave me just shy of fifteen minutes before homeroom.</p><p>Nasera points to my phone. “Yeah, you definitely need to adjust your alarm from now on. I suggest you set it to 4:45 so you can be ready by five.”</p><p>With a nod, I do as Nasera instructs. That makes the ptero chuckle a bit, probably because of my enthusiasm or something like that. </p><p>“Since you’re here an hour earlier than you normally would be, what’re you planning on doing until class starts?” Nasera asks.</p><p>“I… I don’t really know,” I answer. “I mean, I guess I can go to the closest convenience store and get something cheap for breakfast?”</p><p>At my words, Nasera’s eyes light up. “Oh, I have an idea!” she exclaims as she stands up from her desk. “Why don’t we have ourselves a REAL breakfast!”</p><p>I’m taken a bit aback by the suggestion.</p><p>Nasera’s response is to give me a wide cheeky grin as she wraps a hand around my shoulder. “Might as well celebrate you joining the sports club, as well as the new clothes, no?”</p><p>I’m not sure I’m that comfortable ‘celebrating,’ as Nasera puts it...</p><p>“Hey, if you’re worried about paying for the meal, then don’t. My treat!” Nasera chimes in, almost as if sensing some of my unease over the matter. “Besides, this is also a ‘two birds, one stone’ type thing, since I also have to go pick up my sis—I mean, sibling…” the ptero lets out a tired sigh at those words. “Fang got banned from using public transportation after she got into a fight with another passenger. Something about being ‘misgendered’ or some stupid gender-politic bull. Lady wasn’t really hurt, but she made such a huge fuss that the police had to get involved...”</p><p>“That’s…” I start, but I don’t dare finish my thoughts. </p><p>I may not be that familiar with Fang personally. Still, from our cold interactions as lab partners and occasional lunch buddies, Nasera’s sister can be quite the insufferable bitch…</p><p>“That sucks,” I salvage my previously started statement and give Nasera my most sympathetic gaze.</p><p>“I swear, if it wasn’t for the fact that dad’s in the police force, Fang would be in jail by now,” Nasera hisses through gritted teeth. “Because of that ban, I’m probably gonna have to chaperone her—them—to and from school for the rest of the school year, or at least until dad can work more of his magic and get Lu—I mean, Fang—un-banned from using public transportation...”</p><p>I make a mental note to never mess with Nasera father since he sounds like someone I don't want mad at me, especially if he has enough pull to keep someone from getting arrested for assault...</p><p>“Like… shit!” Nasera suddenly shouts as she lets go of my shoulder. “As if Fang wasn’t already giving me enough bullshit over the botched concert last week, now I have to deal with this! And all for what? Because they have this enbie phase going…”</p><p>I recall the concert vividly. Nasera invited me to go. I went because of free pizza, but I ended up getting a hell of a lot more than I bargained for.  I still feel kinda shitty for laughing at Fang, Trish, and Reeda, even if their music did suck. I mean, two basses? Who the hell uses two basses?</p><p>Nasera closes her eyes and takes a deep breath to calm herself. “I’m sorry I suddenly shoved that shit on you, Anon. It’s just that…” she again sighs and looks down at the floor. “Regardless of whatever she says or does, Fang’s my sister… and I’m going to do everything that I can as her younger sibling to support her.” The ptero again looks up, her brows furrowing in an expression that doesn’t fit in with Nasera’s natural beauty. “Even if her whole gender act is a way to get attention!” she spits out with far more vitriol than she probably intended. </p><p>“Well,” I start, already feeling like I’m privy to far more information than I’m comfortable knowing. “Sounds like you’ve got a full plate this morning. So…” I rub the back of my neck and try to give my new club captain as easy a smile as I can manage. “Why don’t we put a pin on the whole celebratory breakfast? I’ll… leave you to your business…” I don’t wait around to see Nasera’s expression. I turn the fuck around and take a step out of the office.</p><p>“A-Anon, w-wait!” Nasera exclaims. At the same time, I feel a hand grab onto my wrist. “I… I know…” she starts in a soft and vulnerable voice before clearing her throat. “I know we’ve only known each other for a week and a half, but in that time, I feel like you’ve... become a good friend.” She lets go of my arm as I turn around to face her. “Maybe it’s a bit too much to ask from someone who I just became friends with… but... can you stick around while I pick up Fang?” Almost as soon as she asks me that favor, she raises her hands and waves them around as if trying to keep me from getting heated over her words. “Y-you don’t have to t-talk to them… or even acknowledge they are there! I-I-I-I… I just want someone else there to keep the drive from feeling so awkward…” </p><p>I inwardly grumble. The last thing I want is to get mixed up in some kind of family drama. I try to think of a way to get out of the situation unfolding before me, but any idea dies as something else in me pushes me to help out my club captain. </p><p>If nothing else, because I owe her for the new clothes. I’d also be lying if I said that her pretty face also wasn’t a factor.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Okay, I’ll help you out,” I reply, causing Nasera’s expression to lighten significantly. “But,” I add before the ptero can get a word in, “You owe me an extra-large breakfast!”</p><p>“Deal!” Nasera acknowledges with far more cheer than I expected.</p><p>“Now ‘common, we have to hurry if we want to get that breakfast AND pick up my sibling before school starts!” Nasera announces as she leads me out of the office, which she locks up on the way out.</p><p>I voice no argument. I don’t say anything as the two of us walk back to the car. I have a thousand and one thoughts going through my mind though, but none of them would make the situation feel any less strange. </p><p>Never in a million years did I imagine myself not only joining a sports club, but also befriending its eleven out of ten babe of a captain while also helping her deal with family troubles having to do with a sister who, despite what most dinos may tell you, was a pretty decent nine out of ten, her whole gender rebellion notwithstanding...</p><p>When we reach the car yet again, I once again can’t help but raise an eyebrow at its looks. ‘Like, why’s it split down the middle aesthetically? It’s a nice car, though. Definitely unique…’</p><p>“Oh, you like my car?” Nasera asks, smiling as she unlocks her door and pops it open. “Quite the beauty, isn’t she? Even gave her a name: the ‘Nasera-Mobil!’”</p><p>I can’t help but chuckle at the name my captain gave her car. “I mean, it’s a cute name… but it’s also a bit tacky, don’t you think?”</p><p>“I… don’t think it’s that tacky…” Nasera says before pouting a bit. “What would you name it, since you seem to be in the business of naming things,” Nasera demands, crossing her arms all the while giving me an expectant look. </p><p>I stop to think about it for a second. The car's split down the middle, one side clean while the other rough. It matches its owner in that regard, so it has to bear part of Nasera’s name. And the car’s… well, a car. ‘Mobil’ is an outdated term, though. It makes it sound like one of those golden-age superhero vehicles designed to sell toys to gullible little children.</p><p>So, Nasera’s Car. Nas… Car...</p><p>I snap my fingers and grin. </p><p>“How about NasCar?” I suggest to my club captain.</p><p>Nasera’s eyes grow to the size of dinner plates in wonder as she unfurls her arms. “Anon... that’s… That’s an amazing name!” She cheers, running a hand over the roof of her car. As she does, she lets out a laugh as she slides into her seat, something I do to speed the process of taking off along. “NasCar,” she whispers in an almost dream-like tone. “That’s just so damn creative... No wonder you guys taught us dinos how to use fire and tools and agriculture. Humans are such geniuses!”</p><p>I pretend not to hear what Nasera said, even though I’m pretty sure it’s supposed to be a compliment. I’m too busy basking in the afterglow of my achievement when it comes to coming up with witty, punny names.</p><p>“One more thing to celebrate!” Nasera announces as she ignites the engine, which roars as if also happy about the new name. “To the newly renamed NasCar!” she declares as she pulls out of the parking lot and flies down the street at more than sixty miles an hour.</p><p>I very quickly clip on my seatbelt. The last thing I want is for my time of glory to end with me as a red stain on the NasCar’s window...</p></div>
