                    <p>Title: Ending 4 - Reconnecting</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>A summer breeze whipped through the quiet streets of Volcaldera, the wind providing some relief from the stifling temperature. Even as the sun completed its descent behind the bluff on the edge of town it was hot as balls, and I once again loosen the tie around my neck. Fang and I had just finished out dinner date at a fancy restaurant, but the hot summer night is making me regret suggesting we walk home rather than catching a cab. Fang herself seems unaffected by the heat, idly humming a tune as her tail wags in rhythm, her hand caught in mine. The amber pendant I had given her all those years ago hangs in the low neck of her dress, catching the final rays on the sun beautifully. I can’t help but stare at her, smiling gently at just how wonderful she is. I had only just returned to Volcaldera last week, and already we were inseparable, just like before. </p><p>“Are you going to stare at me all night, dweeb?” Fang interrupts my thoughts with a soft jab to the ribs, snapping me out of my reverie. I can see the faint blush still remaining on her face, evidence that I had been staring none to discreetly for some time now. “Weren’t we going back to your place?”</p><p>Smiling again, I give her hand a squeeze. “What’s the harm with a guy staring at his girlfriend, huh?” Girlfriend. That word feels nice on my lips after all these years being apart. Sure, I visited Volcaldera when I could find the money too, but never for more than a week or so, the joyous occasion always tainted by the bitter knowledge that I would have to leave Fang again. We avoided the couple label then, finding it made our break easier. But now I was back, and I had no intention of leaving Fang again.</p><p>“Oi, got a loicence fer starin’ then, luv?” Fang’s British accent had not improved in the intervening years, but it made me laugh regardless. “Seriously though, how far is your new place? I’m dying out here.” Fang beat her long eyelashes exaggeratedly, a little pout emphasizing her mock distress. “It’s like, a hundred out here Anon, how can you stand that tie?”</p><p>“And I thought dinos were supposed to like the heat”, I retorted, pointing towards where my new apartment sat on the corner of the block. Luckily I was able to escape Skin Row this time around, my sound engineering degree paying off nicely, and I managed to land a nice upscale standalone apartment on the edge of downtown, not too far away from Fang’s. “Besides, it’s just over there. I still can’t believe you didn’t help me move in, how lazy are you?”</p><p>“Hey! I had to do that field trip, remember? To the museum? I made it clear that it was going to cost you one whole bag of dino-nuggies, and someone failed to deliver!” Fang emphasizes her point with another soft jab in my ribs, the blow softened by how she never broke our hand-hold. Her voice dropped as her amber eyes darting up and down the empty block. “Besides, it’s more fun to see it for the first time now, Anon. I really am dying out here.” Her voice was breathy, needy, full of unsaid promises that could only be confirmed when we were together alone. As Fang stared up at me with lidded eyes, it finally dawned on me why she was so needy: It was estrus season. I had been away for so long, been able to only visit in certain months of the year that I had forgotten when her time of the year was. Suddenly, memories of the last time Fang and I had been together for an estrus season came rushing back, the heat blossoming across my face having nothing to do with the setting sun. </p><p>“Ah, well, that’s, uh…” It was all I could do to stumble out something, anything, that resembled speech, as all the blood in my head made a mass exodus to a place a little further south. I was suddenly very glad that the streets were empty, trying to nonchalantly adjust the bulge that was growing in my jeans. Fang shifted her hand out of mine and into the small of my back, her claws tracing a delicate pattern through the thin fabric. </p><p>“What’s the matter, Anon, ptero got your tongue?” Fang’s words were pure honey as she moved her wing around my shoulder, forcing me to lean down towards her. Still walking, Fang extended her long tongue, lazily flicking my ear before briefly tracing the inner folds. “It’s been a long time since we… cuddled, Anon,” she said with a purr, her hand moving down to squeeze my ass. “What are you waiting for, dweeb, let me in…” I was surprised to find that we were at the door to my apartment, my brain having decided that it had more important things to do than remember the intervening distance. </p><p>“Ah, oh, yeah, sure! L-let me get the keys, and…” My hands moved in slow motion, the silver keys drawn to the lock as if by a magnet, however they worked. Fang’s hands were all over me now, her earlier apprehension for passers-by proving a weak defense against the ranging torrent of hormones currently flowing her thick, powerful veins. The key penetrated the lock slowly, taking a complete and total pleasure of the experience as it entered the lock. The metallic sound of the mechanism was lost to me as Fang attacked my ear once more, moaning in anticipation. Something was wrong, however; even as I twisted the door handle like a madman, the door refused to budge, disallowing any entry like some sort of thick wooden chastity device. </p><p>“Door…stuck…” I mumbled, trying it once more as Fang’s hands explored even lower on my body. I dared not turn my gaze away from the dull surface of the door, for fear that catching even a glimpse of Fang as she was right now would send me over the edge. Every available bit of blood seemed to be rushing to my mounting erection at this point, and my mouth seemed to have forgotten how words were formed. Sweat poured down my forehead, stinging my eyes. Never in my life did had I thought I would end up cockblocked by a door. </p><p>“That’s because you have to turn the key, dweeb. See, like this…” Fang’s honeyed words sounded far away as her hand crawled down mine, taking the key between two fingers and twisting, slowly. Tumblers shifted as the key rotated in the lock, forcing the door to yield its defense against our entry. Finally, the key could turn no more, and Fang rested her hand on mine, the other turning my head to face her. Fang’s amber eyes shimmered in the fading light, seemingly burning with some sort of inner brightness as they drilled into mine. Her mouth was open, and I could hear her ragged breaths as she panted like the animal in heat that she was. Curiously, her breath was clouding in the air despite the heat, probably another consequence of my brain shutting down. Fang continued our gaze a moment more before twisting the door handle, guiding my hand to do the same. </p><p>“You’ve got five estrus seasons to make up for, Anon.” </p><p>Stop penis, I can only get so erect. </p>
