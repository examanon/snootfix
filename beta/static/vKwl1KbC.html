                    <p>Title: Anon's Special Day</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Trish, Reed, Naomi</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot </p><p>Author: P.M.</p><p>â€‹</p><p>>Another day, another boring trudge to school</p><p>>Ending a night of Rock Ring and waking to this oddly frigid morning does nothing to help Anon's mood</p><p>>Maybe one day he'll wear appropriate clothing for the weather</p><p>>Today is not that day. Tomorrow's not looking good either</p><p>>The school comes into view, as well as his rival</p><p>>Anon gives the bollard a hefty smack as he passes it. The pain coursing through his palm a reminder that he's not yet strong enough </p><p>>He saw what Principal Spears did that day. That flag pole didn't stand a chance</p><p>>Neither did the students that put the underwear up there</p><p>>Motion in the corner of his eye drops him from his clouds of thought</p><p>>Now there's a sight for sore eyes</p><p>>The Goth-Ptero-GF known as Fang runs up to meet Anon at the top of the stairs</p><p>>Texting is no replacement for the delightful sensation Anon's tightening heart experiences as he walks with Fang in person</p><p>>Smalltalk chirps out between the two of them, filling in the gaps of their weekend that were too small to text</p><p>>The school's entrance comes into view. Now there's an opportunity. Those doors aren't wide enough are they?</p><p>>An arm reaches across Fang's shoulders, pulling her into Anon in a side-hug as they pass the threshold into the school</p><p>>Fang quietly squawks out a note of embarrassment, before playfully pushing Anon away</p><p>>Gotta maintain that punk outcast appearance eh?</p><p>>Red blush marking her face does a poor job of hiding her feelings however</p><p>>The moment was soured as a certain dinosaur rounded the corner, walking a straight line to them</p><p>>Raptor Jesus what does the tangerine terror want now? And what's that in her hand?</p><p>>Naomi reaches her destination in front of the pair, offering out plastic platitudes in greeting</p><p>>Where's Naser to pull her away when Anon needs him? She's going to make them miss their first classes</p><p>>Anon's thoughts are interrupted as Naomi finally ends her spiel and thrusts a small box wrapped with a ribbon towards him</p><p>>Wait what? Right in front of Fang?</p><p>>What scheme is she trying to pull off now?</p><p>>Anon swears he can hear the bones in Fang's hand grind together in anticipation of a second round</p><p>>Naomi must have heard it too, as she abruptly finds a reply to go with the box</p><p>>"Happy birthday Anon!"</p><p>>What!? Wait... uh. Oh. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</p><p>>The box is gingerly taken from Naomi's hands</p><p>>Raptor Jesus, it's already been a year since the last one?</p><p>>Anon can't even remember what happened last year</p><p>>Is this what getting old feels like?</p><p>>Fang is stunned to silence beside Anon, her face communicating her message before her voice can</p><p>>"It's your birthday!? Why didn't you tell me?"</p><p>>Anon scrambles for the proper words. The truth of it sounding out like a half-baked lie</p><p>>I mean really, who forgets their birthday? I guess only weirdos like himself</p><p>>Anon tries to distract Fang away from his excuse by revealing what the box contains</p><p>>Attached to the ribbon, a small pre-made tag reads 'Happy Birthday'. Naomi must have expected him to see that first</p><p>>The ribbon is torn away, and the box unfolded to reveal a cupcake</p><p>>That's... actually kinda nice. Breakfast never seemed to last very long after his trek to school</p><p>>Anon gives Naomi a small word of gratitude as he takes a bite out of it</p><p>>Not his favourite flavour, but there's enough sugar and frosting on it to give him adolescent diabetes and that's good enough for him</p><p>>A bittersweet feeling seeps into Anon's heart. Even if it is a scheme, Naomi did go out of her way to remember his birthday and get him a gift</p><p>>The expression adorning his face tells Naomi all she needs to know</p><p>>Her mission accomplished, she excuses herself, walking away from the pair</p><p>>Anon can't quite figure her out. Maybe she's still sore about prom and is trying to one-up Fang</p><p>>Speaking of, Fang still looks pissed. Shit. Think fast don't fuck this up</p><p>>Anon offers her what remains of his cupcake</p><p>>Her gaze sweeps between Anon and the treat until she accepts it with an amused huff.</p><p>>That cupcake never stood a chance. One blur of motion later and it's all gone.</p><p>>Fang's face twists around until it finally settles with a satiated smile, heavy eyelids drooping down for a moment</p><p>>A quick turn of the box reveals the flavour of the cupcake. Something that makes Fang react like that is well worth knowing</p><p>>One mental note to save it into his phone later, Anon looks around to find a garbage can</p><p>>And it's all the way over there.</p><p>>Fuck it. No way is he going to walk that far</p><p>>His arm snaps back with its payload and launches it forward towards the bin</p><p>>It sails in a clean arc through the air and-</p><p>>Oh fuck it's too high</p><p>>Just as Anon resigns himself for another walk of shame, a pink shape whips around the corner and offers its body as a backboard</p><p>>Swoosh, nothing but can</p><p>>Reed just stands there with a look of surprise on his face as the bin hungrily accepts the cardboard offering</p><p>>It only takes a moment for Reed to connect the dots, his vision sweeping to where Anon and Fang stand</p><p>>A wink and some finger guns later, he's gone</p><p>>That guy's timing is impeccable I swear</p><p>>Just before Fang can continue interrogating Anon, the klaxon of the school's early-warning bell rings out. </p><p>>Relief washes over Anon's face. He is in no way ready to deal with the questions coming from Fang.</p><p>>But she reminds Anon that he's not out of the woods yet, and that she expects a proper answer during lunch</p><p>>Shit</p><p>>With a cheeky tongue poking out and wink later, Fang heads off to her first class</p><p>>Anon is left in the hallway with a smoldering red face of his own</p><p>>God damn. What that ptero does to him</p><p>>Fuck English, fuck math</p><p>>More useless poetry crap that Anon can't see being useful ever</p><p>>I mean fuck, it says the drapes were grey! It means they're grey! If they were sad then the author should have said so! Fuck</p><p>>And then Mr. Carlesiidewski piles on an unbelievable amount of math homework</p><p>>Couldn't even get Reed's help this time. He was too preoccupied discussing something with Trish</p><p>>It was clearly a private conversation, and Anon's not one to interrupt his homie like that</p><p>>Reed grabs onto Anon's shoulder with a consolatory hand as they walk to the cafeteria, listening to him gripe</p><p>>Anon is almost too preoccupied with voicing out his misfortunes as Reed pulls him along</p><p>>Wait, what's going on here? This isn't the way to the cafeteria</p><p>>"Reed, this is the wrong way."</p><p>>"Nah man. Gotta grab something from the auditorium first before we grab our grub. Alright? We're taking a scenic route."</p><p>>Yeah sure. Hopefully Fang is out grabbing her own food. Wouldn't want to look like he was flaking out on her by leaving with Reed</p><p>>A short jaunt later, the auditorium stands before them</p><p>>Reed pushes through the door first, quipping that he'll get the lights, and that the item in question is by the stage</p><p>>The stark darkness of the room alleviates Anon's fear of encountering Fang</p><p>>It doesn't, however, alleviate his fear of tripping and having another bollard incident.</p><p>>The light leaking from the door only reaches so far. Anon has to trust his feet just like-</p><p>>Damnit Stella stop projecting those invasive thoughts about shounen anime</p><p>>Reed said to grab something by the stage while he gets the lights. What's taking him so long?</p><p>>Gotta get this and go before the lunch line becomes insurmountable</p><p>>Would Reed really sacrifice a second helping of food for this? Surely not</p><p>>Can't even see what to grab. Batdino is nowhere to assist in this darkness</p><p>>And then all Anon can see is blinding white</p><p>>Hands shoot up to massage his impaired eyes as a hiss of pain escapes him, "Could have used some warning Reed."</p><p>>"Sorry bro." Reed pauses a moment, "It's right in front of you"</p><p>>How the raptor manages to have permanently dilated pupils yet still recover that fast Anon will never know</p><p>>The pain and white afterimage eventually fades, leaving Anon directly in front of a decorated cake</p><p>>Flowing icing announces the occasion: "Happy Birthday Anon!"</p><p>>"SURPRISE!"</p><p>>Anon whirls around, his vision quickly settling on two dinosaurs sitting right behind him in the front row, both looking incredibly smug</p><p>>Fang and Trish sit side-by-side, the pair doing a poor job of hiding their amusement</p><p>>Even Reed is displaying the face of a man whose perfect plan came to fruition</p><p>>But, how did they get a cake on such short notice?</p><p>>"Munchies for munchies my man." Reed replies, the glassware in his backpack signaling its presence as he finally joins everyone</p><p>>"Cafeteria staff will make anything you want, provided they have an incentive."</p><p>>That's... good to know. Not that Anon believes he would ever have anything to incentivize them with</p><p>>Fang pushes up off her seat, walking towards Anon before encircling her arms and wings around him</p><p>>And then the singing begins</p><p>>If there is a better way to have someone sing Happy Birthday, Anon cannot fathom it</p><p>>Even Reed and Trish join in as Fang rocks him back and forth to its tempo</p><p>>Anon's heart thrums against his ribcage with its own sympathetic voice, he himself being left speechless</p><p>>He knows Fang can hear it, can feel it, can understand the unbounded love pulsing within</p><p>>She certainly knew it couldn't be quietened by a hug alone</p><p>>As the song reaches its crescendo, they pull apart slightly, giving just enough space to bring their lips together</p><p>>A spark crosses between them on contact, signaling the coming end of their embrace, yet promising a future encore</p><p>>They part with a smile, Fang moving over towards the cake</p><p>>"Come on Anon, let's get some cake before Reed eats it all."</p><p>>Anon turns around and</p><p>>She wasn't kidding. Reed's dishing himself out an entire quarter of the cake onto a plate</p><p>>His lunch replacement in hand, Anon sits down to enjoy another gamble with diabetic shock</p><p>>Or at least he would if Reed wasn't unsubtly hinting at something</p><p>>No seriously, what is this? Interpretive dance? Dino sign language?</p><p>>Now Anon wonders if he was shitposting at some critical moment in Mr. Tsuki's class</p><p>>Shit, will this be on the final exam?</p><p>>Without warning, Trish grabs the back of Reed's head and dunks it straight into the pile of cake on his plate</p><p>>Even months of being with these dinos doesn't prepare Anon for pranks of this caliber</p><p>>Reed emerges from his cake mountain, a content smile on his face as he chews away at what his mouth scooped up during the descent</p><p>>Anon swears he heard Reed say "Now it's a party", but with that much food in his mouth it's hard to say</p><p>>That makes Anon wonder, does this mean he's next in line if he joins one of their birthday celebrations?</p><p>>Eh. Probably worth it. Not like his cue-ball-head is that hard to clean anyway</p><p>>The dwindling slab of dessert marks the passing time</p><p>>Anon is about ready to throw in the towel when Fang finally presents him with the question he's been dreading all day</p><p>>How could Anon forget his own birthday?</p><p>>Where does he even start? With how every birthday had a completely different set of kids join in?</p><p>>Anon swears the gifts could have been found at a gas station, the parents using the occasion as cheap day-care for their kids</p><p>>It dwindled down from there. Eventually, it was just him and his parents. </p><p>>The two of them didn't care much for it either</p><p>>Just another day with their spawn</p><p>>Anon hasn't even received a text message today never mind a phone call</p><p>>Maybe they'll remember they forgot when tomorrow rolls around</p><p>>Probably not if last year is anything to go by</p><p>>By the end of his tale, Fang looks like she regrets asking</p><p>>Even Trish looks to be contemplating how she's treated Anon over the past few months</p><p>>Reed is, well... he did stop eating his cake. That's gotta count for something</p><p>>The trio glance back and forth at each-other before coming to a silent agreement</p><p>>Fang pulls Anon out of his chair before her arms squeeze into him as if he might turn to dust and blow away</p><p>>She isn't alone either, Trish and Reed join in the embrace seconds later providing their own strength and support for Anon</p><p>>...It's been a really long time since Anon has felt like this</p><p>>Even he can't play the stoic now</p><p>>Shuddering breaths. In and out, in and out</p><p>>All those lonely years, all that regret, just let it go</p><p>>Anon is the one to signal the end of the embrace, his emotional roller coaster arriving at the station at last</p><p>>Reed and Trish are the first to peel away, with Fang taking a moment longer before she too decouples from him</p><p>>Anon wipes the tears out of his eyes. His friends may understand the watery trails lining his face, but the rest of the student body is a bit more primal</p><p>>The next classes are soon. Would be best to get everything cleaned up</p><p>>Reed announces that he'll deal with what remains of the cake.</p><p>>Anon heaves a laugh. Guess Reed's getting his second round after all</p><p>>Their farewells said, Fang and Anon split off to their next class, hand in hand</p><p>>Anon's not sure which of the deities granted his wish, but Dr. Fernsworth isn't in class today</p><p>>Something bad on the news Anon guesses. He did skim across a story about a toxic waste transport tipping over today.</p><p>>In his place is some substitute teacher who just can't be bothered</p><p>>Fang is definitely taking advantage of the situation. Her fingers are a blur across her phone screen as she shuffles through multiple conversations</p><p>>Meanwhile, Anon is attempting to put a dent in his math homework</p><p>>Maybe he can bump up his grades if he stops mooching off Reed all the time. A bit of a long shot sure, but the military is looking less and less appealing by the day</p><p>>Fang's whirlwind of fingers pauses a moment to query Anon's plans for today</p><p>>Rock Ring, Saturnia, shitposting and...</p><p>>Pffff no. He's not doing anything if she's the one asking</p><p>>Her eyes glint in the light before she returns to her phone, the tornado of texting returning to wreak havoc on her phone screen</p><p>>Anon heavily considers getting some typing tips from Fang. At the speeds she's going, she could conquer entire websites</p><p>>Then again, he can't explain to her why he wants texting lessons. The secret must remain contained</p><p>>Last class of the day, freedom close enough to taste</p><p>>Doesn't mean that Anon is home free however.</p><p>>Who is Coda and why do people keep going back to him? Sometimes he's Fine, sometimes he's in D.C.</p><p>>Fang's already completed her worksheet, and is softly plucking away at the strings of the hall pass</p><p>>Every now and then she'll glance at Anon's worksheet and prod him towards the correct answer</p><p>>All but the last one anyway. Seriously what did the Italians do to have everything in music named by them?</p><p>>Fang isn't divulging any answers for this one</p><p>>Anon's pleading look must have done something however, as Fang finally responds</p><p>>"I'll help you on one condition."</p><p>>Well, it couldn't be that bad could it? It is his birthday</p><p>>Anon agrees without even bothering to ask what the condition is</p><p>>A predatory grin forms on Fang's face, her prey cornered</p><p>>Her unstructured practice halts, replaced with hushed chords</p><p>>The chords pick at Anon's memory. They're familiar, yet ethereal, tracing the edges of his thoughts</p><p>>Then, a lightning strike of realization courses through Anon, his eyes widening. Fang takes that as her cue</p><p>>Without a sound, Fang encores the words sung in the auditorium</p><p>>A secret to everyone else in class. They're either too focused on their own classwork or are taking a page out of Mr. Jingo's book and have headphones on</p><p>>Still didn't prevent Anon's heart from skipping a beat nor did it prevent the rush of red tint from spilling onto his face</p><p>>This was certainly a new tier of prank Anon hadn't even considered. A knife's edge away from complete and utter embarrassment</p><p>>Anon needs a minute to recover from that while Fang busies herself fixing up his worksheet.</p><p>>The orchestration of school bells signals the finality of the school day</p><p>>Reed and Trish are both there to greet the duo at the exit.</p><p>>Trish passes a bag to Fang, who upon inspecting the contents, hands it over to Anon</p><p>>What are these? Movies? </p><p>>Anon scans over the titles. Planet of the Grugs, Triassic Park, Despot Kong, The Last Unicorn, Unga-Bunga of the Jungle, to name a few</p><p>>Et tu, Trigge?</p><p>>Apparently the school library has a selection of old movies archived away</p><p>>Quite the coincidence that Trish chose these in particular. Did she get some advice from Naser?</p><p>>Trish's poker face is marred by the mirth dancing in her eyes</p><p>>He'd have to get even later. Fang is already guiding everyone to the main event of the day</p><p>>Anon's party to be hosted at her house, complete with even more cake and movies</p><p>>Diabetes is looking better and better every day</p><p>>If Fang's Dad decides he's had enough of Anon, the refined sugar coursing through his veins should give him an edge in running away</p><p>>Maybe</p><p>>The human's and ptero's hands find each other, fingers interlocking, as Anon gives his answer</p><p>>"Yeah, that sounds great."</p>
