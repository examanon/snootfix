<h1>Shared Love</h1><div><p>Title: Shared Love</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Naomi</p><p>Status: Ongoing</p><p>Rating: NSFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: K.A.</p><p>Summary: Fang gives Anon a difficult request.</p><p>​</p><p>>I’m driving along the interstate making my way back to Volcaldera Bluffs from my hometown of Rock Bottom.</p><p>>To my side, my beautiful girlfriend, my honeydew honey, a pterodactyl known to many as Lucy, but to our friends and I as Fang.</p><p>>Technically we’re on break while I’m going to college but during my breaks, as long as we’re together, we’re a couple.</p><p>>We had just finished visiting my parents and...we actually had a good time.</p><p>>My parents were just glad that I actually ended up with someone and didn’t become some sort of woman hating incel.</p><p>>Still didn’t stop mom from grilling her for details about how we met, how we got together, am I still watching those “cartoons”, are we getting married, etc.</p><p>>Fang took it all in stride though, and passed the mom test with flying colors.</p><p>>All my dad had to say was, “proud of you, son,” which was probably the only positive thing he’s ever said to me my entire life.</p><p>“That’s pretty sad”</p><p>>I need to figure out how to stop thinking out loud like that.</p><p>“But I like being able to read your mind, Anon.”</p><p>>Fang chuckles to herself and smiles, God I love her smile, I love HER.</p><p>>Her smile, her eyes, her wings, her voice, her snoot, her-</p><p>“Anon, the road.”</p><p>>I glance back up at the road and realize I am well into the shoulder and correct my mistake. This is a rental and I definitely don’t want to have to deal with getting into an accident.</p><p>“I don’t think you want to deal with crashing any car, dude.”</p><p>>Could I get a zipper surgically attached or something?</p><p>>I quickly glance back at Fang, her smile has faded, lost in thought again.</p><p>>She’d get like this from time to time during our visit, at first I thought it was nerves, but Rock Bottom is long behind us.</p><p>>In fact, she seems to be ruminating even harder.</p><p>“Babe,” I start.</p><p>>She let’s out a long sigh, it seems this was something she was dreading to bring up.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>“It’s about Naomi.”</p><p>>Ah yes, Naomi, the girl responsible for getting Fang and I together. While I’m ultimately grateful that she guided us into a relationship, I didn’t exactly enjoy the idea of being manipulated, and neither did Fang.</p><p>>However, Fang explained to me that they ended up having a heart-to-heart and now they were on good enough terms to be roommates.</p><p>“What about Naomi?”</p><p>“Well, you know how she and Naser are on break, like we are?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Well, Naser got a new girlfriend and Naomi found out about it.”</p><p>>Oof, knowing Naomi she had already plotted out how she was going to get Naser back and how they were going to live out the perfect life.</p><p>>But she didn’t anticipate Naser actually finding someone else.</p><p>>I can only imagine how shattering it must be for her.</p><p>“Anyway, she’s been super mopey and annoying ever since she found out, and so…”</p><p>>Something tells me I won’t like where this is going.</p><p>“Anon, I need you to fuck Naomi so she can shut the fuck up and get over Naser.”</p><p>>I nearly swerve off the road again.</p><p>>I’m on autopilot as my brain reboots.</p><p>>Fang, the love of my life and the one woman I could see my future with just asked me to cheat on her.</p><p>“You’re not cheating Anon, I’ll be there, it’ll be a threesome.”</p><p>“That…’s a little better.”</p><p>>Whose idea was this, was it Naomi’s? Was she trying to get between me and Fang and break us up since she can’t have her perfect relationship?</p><p>“No, it was my idea. She was being super depressing all week before you came to visit. I might have said something after she spent almost every night watching shitty rom-coms and eating literal gallons of ice cream.”</p><p>“Why did she agree to this?”</p><p>“I don’t know, Anon. She just looked so pathetic. I was getting tired of her bitching and moaning and it just... came out of my mouth. At first she was pissed, livid, she couldn’t believe I would even say that.”</p><p>>If I wasn’t right here listening to this right now, I wouldn’t believe it either.</p><p>“But the next morning it was like she was back to her old self. She even made a big breakfast to thank me, and she made sausage and bacon. Sausage. And. Bacon, Anon! Bacon! She’s vegan! And it was the real shit, not that soy crap she would always try to sell me on.”</p><p>>It always was easy to get Fang to agree on something if you used food as a mediator.</p><p>>I focus on the road as I struggle to think of something to say, I open my mouth only to close it again as no words come to me.</p><p>“’Nonny, I get it, I blindsided you with this. I just didn’t want to ruin our time with your parents.”</p><p>“It’s alright, Sweet Tooth… I’ll think about it. You just kind of dumped this on me without a proper warning.”</p><p>“Right, sorry Anon.”</p><p>>She leans back into the seat and crosses her arms, turning her head toward the passenger window.</p><p>>Right on cue I see the sign, “Welcome to Volcaldera Bluffs! Home to Historic Dino-Moe’s Pizza!”</p><p>>A part of me wanted to ask Moe for advice, but that would be a much too awkward conversation.</p><p>>The next few hours are spent in relative silence as we take care of a few errands before going to Fang’s apartment... the one she shares with Naomi... the girl she wants me to have a threesome with.</p><p>>Honestly, for any other guy this would be a dream come true, but something about the whole thing seemed off.</p><p>>I return the rental car, the Bluffs has pretty good public transportation, so it would be an unnecessary expense.</p><p>>I also wanted to stretch out the time we had alone together, before we meet up with Naomi.</p><p>>We decide to drop by Trish and Reed’s place to say hello, and do a little catching up.</p><p>>Trish opens the door and is excited to see Fang, I, however, am met with a curt, “oh, hey,” before she lets us in.</p><p>>I see that things haven’t changed much between us.</p><p>>The purple triceratops and my girlfriend begin chatting and I immediately tune them out.</p><p>>Fortunately, Reed was out at the moment, which gave me ample opportunity to sort out my thoughts.</p><p>>I take on a thinking pose with my hand over my mouth just to make sure I don’t say anything out loud.</p><p>>Naomi was kind of hot back in high school, even if she annoyed me to no end. </p><p>>But she was still a manipulator, someone who wouldn’t be satisfied unless everything went her way.</p><p>>Taking Fang’s story into account, she didn’t seem too into the idea of doing it with me, so why the 180?</p><p>>Was she trying to break Fang and me up? Fang doesn’t think so, but what else was there to gain from this?</p><p>>Even if I take it at face value, there were still some red flags.</p><p>>Her boyfriend that she had planned her entire life around suddenly decides to break it off.</p><p>>Normally this would be something you could get over in a few months, but for someone like Naomi, it would be soul crushing.</p><p>>She moves in with the sister of her ex.</p><p>>This also wouldn’t be too bad if it weren’t for the bad blood they had before. </p><p>>Back in high school, Naomi saw Fang as an obstacle that took too much of Naser’s attention away from her. That’s why she paired the two of us together, to get Fang out of the way.</p><p>>Moving in with Fang was probably a good way to keep tabs on Naser without having to resort to stalking him.</p><p>>Now he has a new girl and any chance that her plans could go back on track is now very slim.</p><p>>Breaking us up won’t bring Naser back, but there’s no way that she’s thinking clearly anymore. I’ll have to be careful of any tricks she might pull.</p><p>>I’m not saying she’ll try to sperm-jack me, but...</p><p>“We’ll have to go by the drugstore and buy some fresh condoms, just in case.”</p><p>>As I finish my thoughts, I realize that Fang and Trish aren’t talking anymore.</p><p>>Fang is covering her face in embarrassment while Trish has her trademark pissed off expression.</p><p>“Did I say that last part out loud?”</p><p>>After leaving Trish and Reed’s we stop by a corner store and pick up a box of condoms.</p><p>>This is pretty much a confirmation that I’ve agreed to Fang’s... proposition and her mood lifted.</p><p>>There was now a pep in her step as we walked to her apartment.</p><p>>She’s humming the song we wrote together and dancing along the sidewalk almost as if she’s in some sort of musical.</p><p>>God, she’s so adorable, it’s almost enough to make me forget about what we were going to do tonight.</p><p>>Now that I think about it, I haven’t really thought about why Fang was so into this idea.</p><p>“Hey Fang-”</p><p>“We’re here~!”</p><p>>I look up at the buildings we stopped in front of, these weren’t apartments, these were townhouses, nice townhouses. There was even a gate in front.</p><p>>Fang types a number into the keypad and the gate rumbles and rolls along its track to allow us in.</p><p>>Whatever reasons Fang has, I trust her. I only need to keep an eye on Naomi.</p><p>>As we near the door a pleasant aroma wafted from Fang’s place.</p><p>“Naomi made dinner for us tonight.”</p><p>>I grimace, I definitely don’t want any vegan food.</p><p>“Don’t worry Honey, she told me what she was making, it’ll be fine, plus she’s a good cook.”</p><p>>That was a small relief, but I was still uneasy.</p><p>>Fang pulls out her key and unlocks the door.</p><p>“I’m home~,” Fang sings.</p><p>>From the kitchen I can hear Naomi dropping what she was doing and rushing to meet us.</p><p>>Naomi remains relatively unchanged since high school.</p><p>>Her hair is a bit longer and her figure has filled out a bit more, no doubt depression weight after separating from Naser.</p><p>>However a big change was her smile, it was genuine. It wasn’t that fake, plastic mask she would wear whenever she needed to sell the facade of a well meaning, but naive social butterfly.</p><p>“Fang! Welcome back, did you have fun at Anon’s parents’?”</p><p>“Yeah, it was great, we’re planning on visiting again during his next break. We might even have both of our parents meet.”</p><p>>Not too thrilled with that idea.</p><p>>Naomi turns to me.</p><p>“Anon, it’s been so long since we last saw each other! How have you been?”</p><p>>Before I answer she pulls me into a tight hug.</p><p>>Her breasts press into my chest as she strokes my back.</p><p>“Mmm, have you been working out? You seem a lot more muscular now.”</p><p>>I have been, one of my dorm mates is a Kinesiology major and needed data on humans. He basically offered to be my personal trainer for free.</p><p>“Y-yeah,” I manage to let out. “A little bit here and there.”</p><p>>I wanted to look good for Fang, but getting a compliment from another girl wasn’t too bad. I couldn’t help smiling.</p><p>>I look toward my girlfriend who had her own smile, but it was quickly falling the longer this hug took.</p><p>>I take the hint.</p><p>“By the way, Naomi,” I grab her shoulders. “What are you cooking?”</p><p>>Naomi quickly pulls away from me and glances at Fang. She gives her a look and Naomi winces. Whatever agreement they had, Naomi must have toed the line a little too much.</p><p>“Oh, ah, yes, I, ah, uh,” she stammers. “I’m making beef and tofu teriyaki, steamed dumplings, and miso soup. I’ve got almost everything prepped and I’m steaming the dumplings. Once I’m done it’ll only take a few minutes to cook everything else.”</p><p>>Everything sounded pretty great, outside of the tofu, but if the sauce was good I’m sure I could tolerate it.</p><p>“Anon,” Fang wraps her arms around one of mine. “Why don’t we go freshen up while she finishes?”</p><p>>Fang’s room isn’t much different here than it was at her parents’.</p><p>>The walls aren’t painted black, but there’s still band posters and movie posters scattered about. She even had her wall mounted guitar stands.</p><p>>I hope she can get her deposit back with all the holes she’s poked into the walls.</p><p>“Eh, I’ll just fill them with plaster and paint over them, they’ll never know.”</p><p>>Still thinking about getting that zipper attached.</p><p>>Fang snickers as she saunters over to me. She grabs me by the collar and pulls me down and plants her snout on my lips.</p><p>>It’s a kiss we’ve practiced time and time again to the point that it became art.</p><p>>Our tongues grope and caress each other as I adjust my posture and embrace her.</p><p>>It’s insane how compatible we are, how our bodies conform, contour, and compliment each other.</p><p>>If you told me at the beginning of high school that my soulmate was a dino... I probably would’ve called you a fag, but I also wouldn’t believe you.</p><p>>I look at Fang, she had a half lidded, sultry expression.</p><p>“I might be sharing you tonight, Anon Y. Mous, but you are mine. No other man I know comes close to you.”</p><p>>I love this woman.</p><p>“Now, let’s go take a shower.”</p><p>>While sexy time in the shower seems like a no brainer, we are both incredibly hungry. So this was a no-nonsense experience.</p><p>>The feathers on Fang’s arms and wings are water repellent, but they’re still a pain to clean, especially the joints where her wings meet her back.</p><p>>She hands me the pouf and I scrub around the joints, careful not to get her feathers and damage the waxy coating. Then I get the rest of her back.</p><p>“Fuck, that feels good,” she moans.</p><p>>This is my favorite part about showering together.</p><p>>I slowly make my way down to her tail before I scrub it vigorously ensuring I get all sides, especially the bottom, because...</p><p>“MMM, FUCK! Save some of that for later!” She says as she moves her ass closer to me.</p><p>“Ha ha, alright, alright, I couldn’t help myself.”</p><p>>I turn around.</p><p>“Alright, now do me.”</p><p>>I hand Fang my washcloth and she lathers the soap bar into it.</p><p>“Yeesh, I really did a number on you here,” she traces a line on my back with her claw.</p><p>“I wear it with pride, my love. It means I did a good job.”</p><p>>She playfully smacks the same spot.</p><p>>My face contorts a bit, that one was a little sensitive, but I don’t think Fang noticed.</p><p>>While she washes my back I notice her hands are delicate, wary around the scratches and scars decorating my back.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t be, like I said, I wear them with pride.”</p><p>>When she finishes, I feel her press her body against mine.</p><p>“Your back is so big,” she mumbles to herself.</p><p>>Looks like I might be rubbing off on her.</p><p>>We stand in silence as the water runs down our bodies, savoring this moment.</p><p>>Then knocking on the door.</p><p>“Are you two almost done? The food’s ready!”</p></div>
