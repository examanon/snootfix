<h1>A Surprise Visit Chapter 6</h1><div><p>6 - HEAT OF THE SEPTEMBER SUN</p><p>​</p><p>The first thing I notice when I wake the next morning is that I’m covered in sweat. The next thing I notice is that I’m resting in a veritable pool of sweat. I slowly raise from my bed, careful not to wake Trish, and walk over to the thermostat. It’s set to a reasonable temperature, so why the fuck was it so hot? </p><p>I slip on some shoes, go outside and run down to the lobby of the apartment complex. It’s no cooler in there than it is in my apartment, and I walk up to the bored looking receptionist. Before I even open my mouth, she speaks.</p><p>“Building’s A/C is fuckered, be fixed whenever.” Right, of course. I thank her and make my way back to my apartment. I hear Trish groaning and stretching, and then shouting.</p><p>“Holy fuck why is it so fucking hot. What the fuck?” I repeat what the receptionist said to me. </p><p>“God damnit. Fuck.” She gets up and walks over to the window, throwing it open. She stands in the sunlight for a few moments.</p><p>“This did not help in the fucking slightest. Fuck.” I quickly check the weather on my phone. It’s currently the hottest day of the week, clear skies, and no wind. This was gonna be a long day. I relay the information to Trish.</p><p>“Fffffuuuuuuuuuuuck,” she groans, stepping into the bathroom and slamming the door behind her, the shower creaking on soon afterwards. I remove my jacket and toss it to the side. I’m usually apprehensive about revealing my skeleton arms around others, but I don’t think Trish will care outside of some mild teasing, and it’s worth it to alleviate some of the heat. I also swap out of my sweat-drenched clothes and into fresher ones, then sink into my desk chair. After a few moments I realize the sun is bearing directly onto me and my seat, so I close the window and shut the blinds, the room darkening significantly. Much better. </p><p>Some minutes later Trish emerges from the bathroom and oh my sweet Raptor Jesus. </p><p>Her signature yellow hoodie is hanging loosely from her hand, and what’s beneath it is a baggy black tank top that just barely leaves enough to the imagination. And then she stretches, raising her arms out high and puffing her chest out. </p><p>“Yep, still hot as shit,” she grumbles.</p><p>“I know. Weather’s pretty brutal too.” Trish looks at me this time, her face a blur of emotions. At first confused, then fucking pissed, then aroused, then back to fucking pissed, all in the space of an attosecond. She throws her hoodie at my face in response, mumbling some swear under her breath. I chuckle and move to the bathroom to commence my own morning routine. </p><p>I throw open the door to the bathroom after I finish, stretching vividly and puffing my chest out.</p><p>“Yep, still hot as shit,” I say, out loud. Trish is leaning against the wall perpendicular to the bed, on her phone and still in her tank top. She doesn’t look up or bother responding at all. Bitch. </p><p>I lean back against the bed’s pillow and navigate to an Tunisian boat maintenance forum on my phone, ready to start my day with some easy internet baiting. Before I can find a suitable target, the phone is practically knocked out of my hands and my shoulder is pushed into the wall. </p><p>The first thing I see is what’s directly down Trish’s tank top, which happens to be her heaving, sweat-glistened, purple breasts. Her top is just baggy enough to let them hang freely, and just tight enough to hide whatever else might be in there. Above that is Trish’s arm, currently pressing my shoulder into the wall, and above that is her face, a wicked, malicious smirk painted on it. </p><p>“You say something, skinnie?” I grin incredibly nervously.</p><p>“Uhhhh, I said ‘yep, still hot as shit’.”  </p><p>“And after that?” Shit shit shit shit shit.</p><p>“N-nothing?” She leans in as close as she can, her mouth an inch from mine.</p><p>“You sure?” She whispers. I lean forward to kiss her, but she backs away as if she expected it, and slaps me in the face. </p><p>“Ah, you bitch!” FUCK! Why did I say that!?</p><p>She holds my head in place and lurches forward, stuffing her tongue into my mouth and sitting down right on my stomach. I don’t even bother fighting back, closing my eyes and lazily hanging my arms on her shoulders to pull her in closer. The muscle flicks around inside of my mouth like a hunting predator as I rub against its underside with my own, reflexively suckling on the invader. She pulls away with a ‘mpwah’, a string of spittle connecting us for a moment before falling into my lap. </p><p>“That’s what I thought you said,” she laughs triumphantly. I can only give a weak ‘hah’ in response as I stare into her eyes. My mind is clouded by two different kinds of heat, which, at this rate, is going to be an ongoing issue for some time. </p><p>Trish grabs the bottom of her tank top and pulls it off, her breasts flopping out and giving an extremely mesmerizing bounce as their full glory is revealed. She flicks the article to the side and tentatively squeezes her boobs together, bringing full attention to the dark purple nipples adorning them. I can only sit back and marvel at their beauty, light shimmering off of her purple scales. I can feel my heart hammering, as well as another organ pulsating against Trish’s thighs. I swear I can see rainbows refracting from her.</p><p>“You just gonna sit there, you fucking idiot?” Her impatient voice snaps me out of my enamored trance, and in a moment of pure clarity, I say the most important sentence that’s ever come out of my mouth in my entire life.</p><p>“You have some fat fucking titties, Trish.” </p><p>“You are fucking hopeless.” She reaches over and latches onto my head, pulling me forward and into her heaving chest. My head presses into those heavenly pillows of life and I wrap my arms around her back, pulling me in further. I nuzzle her sternum as her warm breasts cradle my head, panting like a dog.</p><p>“Do something! Fuck!” I feel a smack on the back of my head, and I’m pulled out of my daze, making a very important realization: my face is in Trish’s fat fucking titties. I sit all the way up and plant a kiss on Trish’s neck, taking one of her breasts in my hand and lightly cradling it. I kiss her collarbone and gently squeeze, then work my way down to her other breast, kissing the top and moving around the side, eventually facing her nipple directly. I put my mouth on it and suck while pressing my thumb against the other one and squeezing. </p><p>“Finally…” Trish moans softly. I eventually swap breasts and continue my work, getting closer to figuring out exactly what she likes with every shiver and shudder. </p><p>“Haah...at least you learn fast…” Sensing an opening, I quickly push against her, shoving her into the bed and I clamber over her, panting heavily, then lean down to kiss her. She lets me take the reins this time, and I take the opportunity to lovingly tongue-dance with her. A hand makes its way down my chest and to my crotch, my blue jeans completely unable to hide the outline of my diamond dong. I respond in kind, my hand making my way down her thigh and to the crease in her black track pants. Trish starts to rub me through my jeans, and I rub her back, her pants offering little resistance to my prodding.</p><p>I fall down onto my side and pull Trish close with my free arm, continuing to kiss her as our stroking increases. She hungirly rattles the button to my pants and undoes it, shoving her hand into my pants and wrapping it around my cock. I slip my hand into her pants, pressing my fingers against her wet pussy. She starts to yank my member, and I apply some pressure to her opening. She makes an audible ‘mmph!’ as a finger slips in and starts stroking faster. She brings her free hand around and tears my pants off, my throbbing cock finally free of it’s denim prison as my finger explores her. She breaks our kiss, breathing heavily as the twin-heat assault rages in and out of her. I move back above her, pulling off her pants and fully revealing her dinosaur slit, the slightest bit of rose peeking through her purple scales. I practically fling myself against her, my cock ready to plunge the depths as I maneuver it towards her.</p><p>“W-wait! C...condoms...” she manages between heavy breaths. I lumber over to the dresser and start yanking open drawers. No, no, no, come on, they’re here somewhere, no, there! I pull the box out and throw the whole thing at Trish. She tries to catch it but it just bounces off her outstretched hand and falls to the floor.</p><p>“Uh...h-how many…?</p><p>“All of them,” I grunt as I clamber back on top of her, my cock twitching with anticipation and glistening with sweat and precum. She fiddles with the box and pulls out the entire strip of twenty-four Ragnum condoms. She shakily pulls one off and tears it open, pressing it against my dick. I unroll it the rest of the way and collapse back onto her, shifting and gyrating my hips into position. I press my tip against her entrance and take a good look at her face, full of arousal, anticipation and preparedness. Why, I could probably stare at it forever…</p><p>“...Anon?”</p><p>“Yeah”</p><p>“Are you gonna…?</p><p>“Gonna what?</p><p>“Gonna…”</p><p>“You’ll have to be more specific, Trish. What is it you want?” She tries to growl, but I lightly thrust against her and it comes out as a moan. She bites her lip.</p><p>“Fuck me like the raptor-damned monkey you are!” Say no more.</p><p>I plunge my cock straight into her, watching as her eyes roll into her head and her tongue flops out, letting out a guttural moan of pure lust and pleasure. I waste no time getting to work, the apartment very quickly filling with moans, grunts and the slaps of flesh against scale as I take this once-bitchy triceratops straight to pound-town.</p><p>Her arms and legs all wrap around me simultaneously, begging me to go deeper and deeper as she incoherently moans into my ear. I wholeheartedly oblige, my full length finding refuge inside of Trish as I continue to hammer away at her, every thrust sending a jolt of pleasure through our bodies. Her shape, her tightness, and her wetness all work together to create the perfect home for my cock, which I am currently completely and utterly destroying. </p><p>“Anon…!” She loudly moans my name as she squeezes me even harder, our explosive finish just ahead.</p><p>“FUCK!” Trish screams in pure ecstasy and her entire body tenses, inside and out. The sudden pressure from every direction pushes me over the edge, and I roughly commit my final slam into her as wave after wave of orgasmic pleasure washes over us.</p><p>We collapse into a moaning, shuddering pile together. We bask in the afterglow, our hot, sweaty bodies pressed against each other as we gaze into each other’s eyes, our heartbeats and breathing synchronized. </p><p>Trish eventually breaks the relative silence with giggles. It’s contagious and I giggle with her, unsure why. </p><p>“Hehehe, what....what’s so funny?”</p><p>“Mom’s gonna be piiiiiiiissed.” She busts out laughing.</p><p>“Hehe...if you think that’ll piss her off, wait till you see what I do to you in ten minutes.” </p><p>“You sure you can handle that? You look like you’re gonna pass out.” </p><p>“I...uh…” Holy FUCK it is hot in here. Trish snickers at my exhaustion. “Maybe...maybe fifteen minutes. Ugh…” I fall onto my back, panting. </p><p>“I’ve got a pretty good idea,” Trish says, glancing over towards the bathroom. She looks back to me, and I obnoxiously waggle my eyebrows in response. She picks up the nearest things she can and throws it at me, which happens to be the condom strip.</p><p>“Hey, only twenty-three to go!” </p><p>“You wish.” She slowly stands up, and I take the opportunity to drink her fully naked body in. She was magnificently lithe, her hips and ass having the perfect amount of meat and curve. She starts off towards the bathroom, her hips and tail swishing mesmerizingly with every step. You really struck out, huh Anon?</p><p>I follow her into the bathroom as the shower creaks on, a spray of water falling from the spout. She smirks at me as she silently steps into the stream, although I can see her body tense from the temperature. I step in after her and…</p><p>“Ffffffffffff....ooh fuck that’s cold.” Trish cackles in reply. </p><p>“I think it’s refreshing.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I have a solution.” I press Trish into the wall and plant my lips on hers, pressing our bodies together. Ah, sweet warmth. I suckle on her neck and start working my way down the rest of her body, tasting the sweat and lukewarm water clinging to her. I squeeze her breasts as I pass them, continuing down her midriff and between her legs. I lovingly kiss and caress her thighs as she moans, and plant one final kiss just above her pussy. I dive in with my tongue, greedily lapping at her and causing her to yelp in surprise. </p><p>“Ah…! Anon...shit...!” I press my face against her nethers, shoving my tongue inside her like she did to me all those times. She writhes against me, loudly moaning as I explore her velvety interior. </p><p>I break off and stand back up, pulling Trish into another kiss, and we share her taste. I look down at my almost painfully throbbing erection, and back up at Trish, the same lust in her eyes as earlier. She turns around and braces herself against the wall, spreading her legs and waving her tail back and forth, looking back at me wantingly. I grab another condom, tear the packaging off and wrap it around my dick. </p><p>I don’t bother with the games this time, and instead grab her tail and use it as support to pull myself straight into her. </p><p>“Fuck! Haah…” Her cute moans only arouse me further as I reach around, grabbing her tits and slamming all the way into her. </p><p>“FUCK!” Damn she’s loud. She doesn’t get any quieter as I jackhammer her against the shower wall. The warmth from her body and the cold from the water as well as my still-sensitive dick amplify the entire experience as Trish and I synchronize our thrusts together. We somehow keep our near-perfect rhythm as our pleasure and tempo increases, the slapping and moaning overpowering the noise of the shower almost entirely. Our rhythm crescendos with our pleasure, Trish screams, and we’re blasted with powerful waves of ecstasy as we orgasm again. </p><p>Soon enough we’re left with just the sounds of the shower and our breathing. </p><p>We wordlessly clean ourselves up and dry off, then lie back down on the bed and embrace each other. </p><p>“Holy shit, Anon. That was...incredible.”</p><p>“A compliment from you? That’s incredible.” </p><p>“This room’s about to be incredibly red if you don’t shut up.”</p><p>“I’ve still got twenty-two more of those, you know? It would be a shame to waste them.” Trish starts to protest, but all that comes out is some affirmative mumble. Guess I win that one. </p></div>
