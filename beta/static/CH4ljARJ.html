<h1>A Dream Too Many</h1><div><p>Title: A Dream Too Many</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot </p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>Summary: A universe where Anon did not show up. No one did for Fang. This is a super short story.</p><p>â€‹</p><p>'Where did everything go wrong? Why am I still here?'</p><p>Deep solemn thoughts cloud Fang's thoughts as she stares at a wall of the dimly lit flat she's in. Such a shitty place but it's all she could ever afford with her gig. She often finds herself lost in thoughts when she doesn't have much to do. She can't bring herself to like music much though still plays it. Her friends and band fell apart. Things weren't meant to go the way they had. However Trish was so insistent on being together. To take the band seriously. Yet things went so horridly after the venue. That shitty promenade with all the stuck up people. No one knew talent there. Not a single soul! Most of the crowd tore into the band with jeers and insults. From there Fang grew distant with little interest for anything. Near prom she decided to take a run for it. If she couldn't make it well perhaps it was for the best right? </p><p>'Ugh. High school was terrible. Why does it feel like I missed out on something?'</p><p>A pack of crumpled cigarettes is quickly procured from her pockets along with a shitty cheap lighter. The cancer stick is lit up to slide between her lips taking a long harsh drag. She felt the nicotine start to help subside some thoughts. A easy comfort that goes too quickly in actuality. She blew out the smoke with a deep sigh making a large wispy cloud that lingered there for several seconds. However at taking a long second draw she started to contemplate her other vices. She hated the feeling that festered there as she tried to fill some void. A void that was formed from broken friendships, a bad family life that turned worse, and so much more. The list piled high. Higher than the last time.</p><p>'The world is filled with excess. So much excess. Yet I . . . I could not escape such a fate. Maybe I deserved this. Maybe I tried to live a dream too many. Maybe...'</p><p>The thought process went downward further into a spiral of despair. The cigarette is quickly put into a cheap ashtray near by as she starts 'preening'. At least trying to with what feathers she had. Pluck. Wince. Pluck. Further wince. Pain helped stave off the pit of darkness that formed too. Though also a quick and temporary solution to what bothered her from the start. A handful of feathers later her phone rings getting her attention. She tries to gather herself taking a deep breath before answering it. It was about her horrid gig at the shitty pizzeria. A show had been agreed upon it seemed. Great more self loathing in auditory expression. Despite her griefs she found music the only way to quell some despair. Maybe just maybe some day things will turn around. She knows she's got the talent! No. Best keep things to a simmer at best. No way she'll be seen at a pizza place. It's at Skinrow of all places too. Fang goes to clean herself up real quick in the awful bathroom then finds her way to her bed to sink down into it. She loosely gathers up her blankets then curls up. It takes her a while to doze off but it's fitful rest.</p><p>"...hey dweeb."</p><p>"Hey there Fang."</p><p>Fang slides her arms around someone. An unrecognizable face. Though one she has no trouble knowing for some reason. She nuzzles up into his jaw lightly as her arms find themselves around this man's waist. He reciprocates with his arms going around her. His hands rest around the small of her back as he gives her the biggest of smiles. She felt happy seeing that big dorky smile. Though parts of her felt . . . at unease.</p><p>"Do you ever wonder what it'd be like if we ever met?"</p><p>"Huh?? Where does that come from?"</p><p>"I dunno. I feel so lucky to have met you."</p><p>Her face tinges quickly with pink to his words. Her tail starts to wag itself behind her. Though more and more parts of herself were being freaked out. Harder than normal this time.</p><p>"You know you over think sometimes I swear. We're together and you're my boyfriend. It's that simple you dweeb."</p><p>"Right right. Things are good the way they are right now."</p><p>"Good. You shouldn't think otherwise ---"</p><p>The name didn't come. She tries a few more times. It still does not come out. She feels a cold sweat break out over herself. Things start to misshape around her. The world itself almost becomes a water-paint version of itself. She starts to hyperventilate as this happens. She tries to reach out for the mysterious man when he too becomes too abstract and vanishes.</p><p>A scream pierces the darkness and she finds herself sitting upright. A dream. A gods damned dream again. She screams out loud again before burying her face into her palms. Quiet weeps come from her as she cries into her hands. And so she would weep for a good while. Life seemed fit to torture her so with a dream too many. </p></div>
