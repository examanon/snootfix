Raptor Jesus, there's so much blood. </p><p>>A mass of something lies near the pterodactyl. Her mascara has run down to her chin, evidence of her crying her heart out. </p><p>>Anon takes off like a bullet, crashing to his knees beside his wife.</p><p>>His hands dance across her body, assessing the situation and checking for anything that might need attention.</p><p>>His throat is gripped by an invisible hand, choking out any attempt at speech.</p><p>>This has to be a nightmare right?</p><p>>This has to be one of his visions right?</p><p>>If he closes his eyes, this will all go away right?</p><p>>He strokes Lucy's face, trying not to break down. He has to be strong. Be strong for her.</p><p>>"Lucy..." He starts. "What happened?"</p><p>>She just starts crying again</p><p>>Her body jerks around, animated like a puppet by her sobbing and coughing</p><p>>Anon wraps his arms around her, trying to comfort her</p><p>>"Calm down, calm down Lucy. It's going to be okay...."</p><p>>It won't be okay, she wails. It can't be okay.</p><p>>He can barely understand her</p><p>>She was cleaning and felt wrong</p><p>>He was gone</p><p>>She didn't know what to do</p><p>>The baby</p><p>>Oh</p><p>>Anon freezes in place, his blood turning as cold as ice</p><p>>He willed himself to not look at the bloody mass he had noticed by Lucy a moment ago</p><p>>Fuck</p><p>>Wordlessly, he hugged Fang until she stopped crying. He stroked her hair, kissing the side of her face.</p><p>>He thought back to the time in high school Naser had wondered aloud how the offspring between human and dino would work out</p><p>>Anon's heart almost stopped. He wanted to vomit. He did this.</p><p>>If he hadn't suggested they try...</p><p>>He should've known she'd have said yes... probably just wanted to make him happy... figured it was what he wanted...</p><p>>Anon tries his best to not let Fang feel his own body begin to shake.</p><p>>He just wanted to make her happy again</p><p>>He just wanted to see her smile again</p><p>>He moves away and turns the handles to the bathtub, watching the warm running water begin to fill it up</p><p>>Anon runs his hands below her leg and neck, picking her up like he did when he brought her to their home for the first time</p><p>>Gently, he takes a pair of scissors and cuts away at the ruined dress. He places her in the tub, and -rag and soap in hand- cleans away the gore</p><p>>Lucy during the ordeal is unresponsive. He watches her bare chest rise and fall, signaling that a the very least she's still alive.</p><p>>Clean up over, he towels her off and places her inside their bed. He kisses her forehead, stroking a stray tear away with his thumb.</p><p>>She closes her eyes, lulled into comfort by the return of her mate.</p><p>>Anon takes a deep shuddering breath</p><p>>Now that he's made sure Lucy is alright and taken care of, and now that she can't see him, he allows himself the pleasure to weep</p><p>>he slumps up against the wall, hands providing a comforting pressure to his eyes. He sobs, over and over again. Harder than he's ever done in his life.</p><p>>after enjoying the brief respite, he picks himself up and walks back to the bathroom.</p><p>>He had focused his attention on his wife and neglected the room</p><p>>Looks like a murder scene in here, just how much did she bleed?</p><p>>He finds the strength in him to look at what was once expected to be their child</p><p>>He hadn't known yet</p><p>>He was wondering why she acted so coy and playful the past month, but he had just figured things were beginning to get better for her</p><p>>he didn't want to question it though, he was just happy to see her enjoying life again</p><p>>Taking a towel, he dirties his hands placing it inside</p><p>>"Sorry, little one. This is my fault."</p>
