                    <p>Title: Rip And Tear</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>â€‹</p><p>Black combat boots steadily make their way through the silent empty halls of Volcano High. The school bell rang minutes ago signaling the start of the next period. Thankfully Fang's next class is music which she can afford to be late for. Mister Jingo isn't particularly bothered if students are tardy, not that he does much teaching anyway. He spends most of the time listening to his old records while his charges goof around with instruments, their phones, or with each other. A terrible way of running a class all things considered. It's all fun and games until test day arrives and half the class fails. Thinking about it, Fang is confident she could be a better teacher than Mr. Jingo. After all, she managed to teach Anon how to play the guitar, granted he wasn't very good, but he made up for it with eagerness. Thinking about her boyfriend, Fang subconsciously starts walking faster. It would be nice seeing the bald dork in person, texting just wasn't the same. </p><p>Fangs' stride falters for just a moment. That new underwear she bought might look cute, but god damn did it pinch her a lot. Thankfully she's all alone and can make necessary adjustments without anyone staring. Just as Fang is rounding the corner, still preoccupied with her wardrobe, someone slams right into her. An odd-looking green dino with hair three-quarters of the way ready to jump off of his head. The boy stumbles and barely avoids falling on his face several times before regaining his balance. He gives Fang a half-hearted 'sorry' before sprinting away. Weirdo. </p><p>Finally getting to the classroom door, Fang pauses before opening it. Something felt wrong. Like there was a breeze somewhere there shouldn't be one. She turns around and that's when she notices the problem. A large hole in her jeans where no one in their right mind would want one. Half her ass is now saying hello to the world, no longer covered as it should be. Naomi is already constantly bitching about her outfit violating the schools' dress code. If she sees her like this, Fang won't be able to bullshit her way out of it like the other times. 'Yes, I need to wear a halter top because of my wings', 'Yes, I need to wear ripped jeans because it gets too hot', 'Yes, I need to wear a choker because it's, uh, an ancient pterodactyl custom'. </p><p>'There's no need to panic', she thinks to herself. 'Just don't bend over and keep your ass covered with your wings, people ignored you this long, what's one more day?' She had to admit that after the concert at Moe's and an attitude adjustment, a lot of the students became much friendlier towards her. 'No matter, just keep your head down and ass covered and you'll be fine'. With that final internal pep talk, Fang opens the door and walks into class. Mr. Jingo doesn't even look up from his seat, he was completely lost in his little musical world. She takes a seat next to Anon, careful not to expose herself to every student sitting behind her. Spending so much effort into keeping herself covered didn't go unnoticed though. Most of the time her wings kind of did their own thing, now they were locked in place like they were plastic. It didn't take long for Anon to notice something is wrong.</p><p>"Fang, you OK?"</p><p>"Sure, it's just, uh, wing cramps. Yeah."</p><p>"Oh, does that happen? Maybe you should go to the nurse." </p><p>Anon gets worried over every little thing when it came to her. Fang had to nip this in the bud before Anon does something stupid and makes a scene. She leans close and starts explaining through gritted teeth. </p><p>"I ripped my god damn jeans and now half my ass is sticking out, OK? Just calm down and don't make things worse than they already are."</p><p>It takes a few seconds for realization to hit anon, along with a slight blush. Not long after explaining the situation to Anon, Fang notices he was doing a poor job of trying to nonchalantly lean back in his chair. Not in a mood for games, Fang places her hand on his thing and pushes down so the man and chair are once again both upright. </p><p>"Are you really that desperate to see?"</p><p>Anon pauses for a moment before blurting out something stupid as was tradition, "I mean, yeah, you have a great a-"</p><p>The only thing stopping Anon from continuing was the vice-like grip the ptero had on his thing. Fangs' claws have already pierced through her boyfriend's jeans and were threatening to inflict minor lacerations if he didn't shut his mouth this instant. Fang was struggling to keep her voice low enough to prevent drawing attention to herself.</p><p>"Do you want a megaphone so the entire school can hear you?" The moment the words leave her mouth, Fang already knows Anon's answer, "On second thought, don't answer that."</p><p>Thankfully no one was paying attention to the exchange between the couple, everyone was far too preoccupied with their phones. While her situation was somewhat upsetting, Fang couldn't help but be happy about what Anon almost said. Call it vain, but she loved compliments about her appearance. At least from her boyfriend. Mercifully, the period was over and no one has noticed or at least commented on Fangs' wardrobe malfunction. The couple waited until everyone else left the room before they too exited. By some miracle, the two make it to science class without incident. Being seated the furthest way back made it possible for Fang to ever so slightly relax. It didn't last long, as Anon was apparently thinking about a way to help her out with the jeans situation.</p><p>"What if we got some black duct tape and just taped over the hole?"</p><p>Anon was quickly thankful that 'if looks could kill' was only a saying.</p><p>"OK, fair enough. What if we got a black piece of paper so it wouldn't be so noticeable? Or we could staple the hole back together."</p><p>"Anon, I swear to god. One more stupid idea like that and I'll...", Fangs, scowl fades away as realization dawns on her, "Wait, I got it. Give me your jacket dweeb."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I'll just tie it around my waist, it's so obvious. Why didn't I think about it before?"</p><p>Anon was not exactly forthcoming with his article of clothing, "But, people will see my skinny arms."</p><p>"Oh, so you're no longer interested in helping once it inconveniences you?"</p><p>In the end, Anon decides his girlfriend's decency is much more important than any mockery he might be forced to endure. He hands over his jacket and Fang quickly ties the sleeves around her waist. The rest of the day goes without a problem and soon Fang makes it home without anyone knowing what happened. Anon insisted Fang kept the jacket until she got home, just in case. Only when she made it to her room, did Fang take it off. It felt so nice, and the smell reminded her of Anon. Fang pulls out her phone and sends her boyfriend a quick message.</p><p>thanks for the jacket</p><p>i'm keeping it btw</p><p>don't like it</p><p>you know where i live</p><p>i'll wrestle you for it</p><p><;V</p>
