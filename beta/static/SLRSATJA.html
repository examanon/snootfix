Half an hour later, 4 dinosaurs and a human were cruising down the road in a beat up car</p><p>>Anon riding shotgun with Naser driving. Fang, Trish, and Reed managed to fit into the back</p><p>>A bit tight back there with all 3 of them</p><p>>Unfortunately, Naser was surprisingly fast in picking everyone up</p><p>>Anon thought for sure Naomi would sideline him for at least 15 minutes</p><p>>Fang asks Anon if it's actually just some sort of prank. Her patience was wearing thin</p><p>>Anon reassures her that this is no prank</p><p>>It's time</p><p>>Anon gives a knowing look to Naser, who confirms the plan is go</p><p>>A theatrical yawn later, Anon turns on the radio. Tunes always help a boring drive right?</p><p>>He dials it to a specific channel, a local channel</p><p>>Fang berates Anon. All that modern pop crap is not something she wants to listen to</p><p>>Anon tells her that he is absolutely certain that she will love the next song, and that he would bet her on it</p><p>>Bet taken</p><p>>The radio hosts crackle in, their voices coming in just as they were announcing the conclusion of a contest</p><p>>Any contest is easy to beat so long as you have thousands of people easily swayed by words online right?</p><p>>The hosts conclude that a local group has won their contest by an absolute landslide. They're not entirely sure where all those votes came from but the people have spoken</p><p>>They're not even certain how to pronounce the name though. Is it with a really long W or do you pronounce it like a German?</p><p>>"Give it up, for VVURM DRAMA!"</p><p>>Startled gasps of shock ring forth from the backseat</p><p>>"YOU GOT US ON THE RADIO!?"</p><p>>The speakers erupt with music recorded from their time at Moe's</p><p>>Maybe low quality but that's why Anon labeled it as "Live"</p><p>>Grey arms shoot out from behind Anon's seat and wrap around him in the crushing hug of an elated ptero as Fang's cries of absolute joy pierce through the car cabin</p><p>>Anon noted that for next time, he should consider ear plugs</p><p>>Oh well, a bit of tinnitus is well worth what is going on now. At least Naser looks unaffected. Must be a ptero thing</p><p>>Anon gives a glance at the back. Reed is shooting him with enough finger-guns that Anon is certain there would be a shortage of ammo, while Trish is still in shock, wide eyed and mouth open</p><p>>And then the chorus kicks in</p><p>>Naser brings everyone out of their stupor, his voice sounding in tune with the radio</p><p>>Anon and Reed join in next, the harmony of voices reaching the remaining 2 dinos as their shock wears off</p><p>>Fang finally lets go of Anon, her voice joining in with Trish, the choir of VVURM DRAMA formed</p><p>>It felt like it was all over too soon, the emotional high of everyone lingering in the air</p><p>>Anon twists around to see Fang</p><p>>She's red in the face from emotion and exertion, giving Anon a smile worth a thousand words</p><p>>Anon reaches back with his hand, and Fang takes it with hers. Words seemed too little for what had just happened</p><p>>Anon knows he's going to get his share of wing hugs later today</p><p>>He fuckin' loves wing hugs</p>
