Him and Naser decided to do a bro's night.</p><p>>The only other person that was home with them at the time was Samantha, nice lady, but could be strict when she needed to be.</p><p>>thankfully she seemed to be nice about tonight, must've seen tonight as Naser getting an "off" day from being the perfect boy everyone sees him as.</p><p>>"You boys tell me if you need something, okay? Have fun~!"</p><p>>Anon looked back at Naser, a bit of a flabbergasted grin on his face.</p><p>>"You know, for a boy's night, it feels more like we're twelve years old having a sleepover."</p><p>>Naser smiled and "pshhh'd" at Anon's teasing statement. He was ready to make him eat his words.</p><p>>"Yea, until I decide to kick your ass at some Claws of Duty, man."</p><p>>Anon rolls his eyes competitively. "You're on, clown-ass."</p><p>>The next few hours is spent with Naser and Anon dicking around and playing vidya.</p><p>>The night gets going and soon enough it's already almost midnight.</p><p>>Anon looks over, barely able to keep his eyes open, but he noticed Naser had just been getting more and more energetic through the night.</p><p>>At this moment Naser was rambling about some meta tactic in Claws of Duty: Advanced Cave-Wars.</p><p>>"ALRIGHT, S-SO LIKE YOU KNOW HOW THE EXO-SUITS LET YOU JUMP HIGH AND SHIT? WELL, WHATYOUGOTTADOIS-"</p><p>>Holy fuck, Anon could barely understand the shit he was saying...</p><p>>Naser got killed by some random enemy, and his scream of rage broke Anon out of his sleepy stupor immediately.</p><p>>"GOD FUCKING DAMMIT YOU RETARDED PIECE OF SHIT TRIGGER MOTHERFUCKER!"</p><p>>Oh God, did Samantha hear that? Did the people in the game hear that? Meh, if the dudes in the game did he didn't care, but Samantha was a different story...</p><p>>"Dude, Naser, you alright man?"</p><p>>Naser looks over as if his seething rage never happened and gave Anon a toothy smile.</p><p>>"Hell yea, man! Never better my skinna! My fucking amigo!"</p><p>>Anon was feeling a little weirded out right about now.</p><p>>"Uhhh, Naser. You've been acting funny." Anon rolls his eyes, sarcasm then dripping from his words. "You forget to take your meds or something?"</p><p>>Naser looks at him, a dead glare all he has.</p><p>>"I did... Didn't I?"</p><p>>Panic sets in Naser as he goes fucking nuts.</p><p>>"OH GOD MY MOM'S GOING TO FUCKING SKIN ME ALIVE I KNOW IT!"</p><p>>Naser sprints to his room's bathroom and shuffling is heard from where anon is seated.</p><p>>Panicked rambling is heard while a pill bottle is heard jostling around its contents.</p><p>>Water is heard turning on, and then silence.</p><p>>After what felt like almost an hour, Naser finally comes back into the room and looks like he did before he went batshit insane.</p><p>>"Sorry 'bout that, Anon. I got these emotional imbalances and I gotta take meds for it. Sorry for not telling you."</p><p>>Anon just sits there, unsure of how to take this info.</p><p>>His face says it all.</p><p>>"What the fuck even just happened right now..."</p><p>>Anon shrugs it off and the rest of the night is spent in relative peace.</p><p>>Guess even someone like Naser needs some kind of "good boy" pills to not go fucking crazy.</p></div>
