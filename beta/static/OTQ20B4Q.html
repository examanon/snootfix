Mous, sound engineer, caveman extraordinaire, ptero swain</p><p>>can't defeat a tie</p><p>>"Brooo... You like, need a hand with that?"</p><p>>I turn to the sudden sound of my surfer stoner raptor 'bro'</p><p>>I half expected his usual green hoodie and ripped up board shorts</p><p>>instead he looks... presentable</p><p>>hair slicked back and professional looking, a two piece suit with a red tie matched with a pair of formal shoes</p><p>>you could honestly tell me this was a completely different raptor and I'd believe it</p><p>>the voice though was easily distinguishable</p><p>>"Never learned how to tie a tie in my life man, even at prom it was just a bowtie. When did you learn this stuff?"</p><p>>the raptor moseys on over and starts fixing up my tie before starting a story</p><p>>"Well man, I was debuting this new mix I had... carfe but without a bunch of the more major side effects and all. They wanted me to do this whole presentation and stuff, so I prepped to go out for it, but they told me I needed to look 'smart'."</p><p>>this one story was already more intetesting than the entirity of my time at university</p><p>>"Anyway, they had me dress up in a suit and everything, but I only had to give like... a four minute speech. So at the end of it I spent more time putting on the suit than talking about my new mix, bro."</p><p>>"Sounds like big business as usual."</p><p>>"Yeah man, I hate it so much but it's the only way to get my good stuff out to the masses and all... maybe one day I'll run my own distribution chain."</p><p>>"With blackjack and hookers?"</p><p>>"Nah man, more like Rock Ring and bros!"</p><p>>he shoots me a pair of finger guns while I sit back and give a sensible chuckle</p><p>>just like old times</p><p>>"You know man, if you're feeling a bit tense I do have some stuff that'll take the edge off."</p><p>>"Didn't you say doing the slightest bit of your stuff would likely kill me?"</p><p>>"Duuuude, I've got human grade stuff now, formulated just so that it hits humans nice and good like it does dinos... does nothing TO dinos though, given the lower dose."</p><p>>tempting offer, but, something ticks me towards no</p><p>>"If Ripley weren't out there, maybe I'd take up your offer. I'd rather not get strangled for being high while marrying his daughter."</p><p>>"Fair enough bro, ever since legalization and all he's been more relaxed around me, especially since I made a 'respectable career' out of it and all."</p><p>>"Well, that's good at least."</p><p>>Reed nods lightly, pulling up a plastic chair next to the one I was in before crashing down into it</p><p>>"Still, there's nothing you really need to worry about bro. Lucy really does love you, and that's why we're all here today, you know?"</p><p>>"Yeah, I splashed so much cash on making sure this day would be perfect for her... getting Moe to cater some high quality pasta was easy, but the seafood and all? Don't even get me started how much I spent on that 'gourmet dino nugget bar'."</p><p>>"I totally thought you were joking when you texted me about that, but then I saw it myself man... that's dedication right there."</p><p>>"I mean, she's worth it really, every bit of effort and every cent of cost."</p><p>>he reaches over and gives me a firm pat on the back</p><p>>"You deserve it just as well man, you helped dig her out of a hard part of her life. Hell, you helped a lot of us out of a funk, me included."</p><p>>"Dunno Reed, I was just being me for the most part, I didn't do anything special other than be honest."</p><p>>"The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world, Mr Mous."</p><p>>I can't help but start laughing as he says that, even with his attempt at matching the delivery</p><p>>"Alright there, G-Man, no need to get deep with me here."</p><p>>He chuckles a bit and kicks back further in his chair</p><p>>"You feeling more assured now, amigo?"</p><p>>"A bit, I can't promise I won't break out into a big dopey smile the moment I see her in a wedding dress though."</p><p>>"Understandable man, still gives me good vibes to see two of my closest friends getting married."</p><p>>"What about you, what about Trish as well for that matter?</p><p>>Reed shrugs his shoulders and gives a smirk</p><p>>"Didn't you hear? Trish is dating some big shot DFL player these days, met him while working in her shop and they hit it off... as for me? It just isn't time for this bro to settle down, amigo, got so much stuff I want to do first."</p><p>>"Hah, fair enough man, good to hear she's doing well. She should be here if she got the invitation."</p><p>>"Think I saw her out there earlier man, Lucy probably asked her to be one of her bridesmaids."</p><p>>"Her best friend and the guy she wanted to kill back in highschool getting married, what a spectacle."</p><p>>"She isn't THAT hard on you these days is she?"</p><p>>"Nah, stuff mellowed right after high school. She's been by our apartment a few times to chat and all, fairly pleasent."</p><p>>"Right on, now you ready for the best day of your life, bro?"</p><p>>"Depends, are you ready to be a best man, Reed?"</p><p>>he gives me another smirk before extending out a fist for me to bump before we both get up out of the chairs before heading out the back of the building</p><p>>Out there in the blinding Volcaldera sun, along a nice elevated view of the sea is a fancy little wedding setup</p><p>>carpet rolled out to the back of reception building, flanked on both sides by seats for all the guests</p><p>>at the head of it was this opulant altar, preist ready and waiting</p><p>>Samantha had already made her way to a front row seat, so that was my cue to go ahead and get on the altar</p><p>>I make my way around the side as I was explicity instructed, given a short greeting from the priest and a warm smile from Mrs. Aaran</p><p>>from there the processional began</p><p>>Naser and Reed made their way down the isle before taking my flank</p><p>>followed shortly by Rosa, Naomi, and then Trish, whom headed over to the other side of the altar</p><p>>wonder where Stella is</p><p>>oh</p><p>>the stegosaurus makes her presence known by enthusiastically making her way down the altar, scattering flower petals around as she went</p><p>>once her peppering of the landscape had ceased she joined the other girls alongside the altar</p><p>>then finally the music ceased</p><p>>my heart essentially locked in place as it refused to beat during that silence</p><p>>knees weak</p><p>>arms heavy</p><p>>but I manage to hold the spaghetti</p><p>>here comes the bride begins to play</p><p>>and there came the bride</p><p>>as beautiful now as she had ever been</p><p>>the long and elegant white dress only accentuated that even further</p><p>>she looks right up to me with a warm smile</p><p>>I return one right back to her, albeit with some attached nervousness</p><p>>alongside her is Ripley, my soon to be father-in-law, sharply dressed in a suit of his own</p><p>>one of the most intimidating people in the world to me</p><p>>though today, his smile bears no malice towards me</p><p>>it seems genuine, like this is one of the best moments in his own life</p><p>>the pair of pteros reach the altar, Ripley giving Lucy a warm smile before giving a slight, approving nod to me</p><p>>he then makes his way back down to sit next to his own wife as the ceremony proceeds</p><p>>Fang hands her bouquet of flowers over to Trish before turning to face me and taking my hands</p><p>>I can't help but give her a big dopey smile</p><p>>the priest then recites out the long winded vows I had written down, having me repeat each one after him before ending my turn with</p><p>>"I do."</p><p>>he then repeats the same with Lucy, reciting vows back and forth with her before</p><p>>With the verbiage down, Naser comes from my side and hands the rings individually to both of us</p><p>>his smile is almost more goofy than mine probably is</p><p>>I slide the ring I was given onto Lucy's ring finger, before she repeats the same with mine</p><p>>finally, we took each other's hands once again as I heard the words I've been waiting to hear for years</p><p>>"I now pronounce you, husband and wife... You may now kiss the bride."</p><p>>and with what I pull her right up to me</p><p>>at this point we had enough trail and error and testing to find the best way to do this</p><p>>I tightly lock my lips to the snout of the gorgeous pterodactyl</p><p>>my wife, Lucy</p><p>>now and forever</p></div>
