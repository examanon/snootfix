                    <p>Epilogue</p><p>​</p><p>A breeze blew into the small studio apartment, slightly disturbing the curtains as it did so. The wind didn’t have very far to go in this small space as it rattled empty take-out containers, swirling around discarded clothes as it circled the small room. Into the deepest part of the room it blew, passing across the new again, but once old, couple of Fang and Anon. Only Anon felt it though; Fang had long since passed out, finally giving into the rejuvenating sleep that she so desperately craved, content that she was safe at last. Anon’s bare arms prickled against the cold autumn air, his jacket long since given over to Fang. It was only hours since he and Fang had gotten back together, a few months since his return to Volcaldera after his long stay away with the Navy. As his eyes drifted shut, Anon felt strange, as if the events leading up to his reunion with Fang had been accomplished by another version of himself. Listening to the breeze as it whistled softly through the stupid, Anon smiled, utterly content at the new life he was about to start. </p><p>The wind blew in from the open window, bringing a new beginning; but it was not the beginning anyone could have imagined.</p><p>Across town, another couple felt the breeze, snuggling up together in their new bed, in their new home. She presses into him, laying herself on his chest, draping a wing over the both of them. He strokes her hair, contently, happily. She had been asleep for hours: He, having only just fallen asleep, the horrible nightmare to which he woke up to a distant memory. </p>
