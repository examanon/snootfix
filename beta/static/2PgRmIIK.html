Your fiancé grasps a proffered forearm, sticking to your side. You think back to the months preceding the here and now. Reuniting with your high-school sweetheart after a stint in the Army, helping her move out of her parents’ place, finally getting on one knee to ask her the most important question of your life.</p><p>It’s been just a few months since you proposed to her. She was so shocked by it that for the first several seconds she could only stare at you, a mesmerized glaze occluding her normally amber eyes. The initial deer-in-a-headlight response was less than encouraging, and you can still remember silently panicking at her reaction.</p><p>She had blinked a few times, tears rolling down her scaled cheeks in fat droplets. You remember her face lighting up in the brightest smile you’d ever seen from her, rapid-fire “Yes!”s and incoherent declarations of love gushing freely as you’d embraced her. You’d held her there in your arms for several minutes, the ptero blubbering tears of joy into your dress shirt. She’d drawn her head back from your soaked chest and leaned up to your face, eyes closed, a gesture you readily reciprocated. Your lips touching the tip of her snout; the two of you had joined in a deep, passionate kiss, one that felt far too short once you broke it off. You remember touching your forehead to hers, catching your breath hot-and-heavy like.</p><p>“All that and I haven’t even put the ring on yet...” you’d said with a nervous chuckle, and she’d given her own before sniffling, lightly swatting you on the arm and looking up at you. “Came at me a little fast ‘s all”. Your hands had fallen from her lithe hips and hers from your broad back, and you’d slipped the simple yet elegant silver band onto her finger. You’d looked back up to meet Lucy’s gaze, and that time it was you who leaned in first for a makeout session.</p><p>A clawed thumb and middle finger in front of your face snap you back to the present. “Car’s back that way, dweeb,” she says, alcohol slurring her words just enough to be noticed. She motions in the other direction with a raised brow and a smile on her snoot.</p><p>You rub at your neck and sigh. “Sorry Loos, got uh… Lost in thought.”</p><p>She hums in acknowledgement, resting the side of her head against your arm and nuzzling against your bicep. Her four-door sedan enters view within a few minutes, and you head around to the other side to open the door for her before getting in the driver’s side yourself.</p><p>The drive home is a relatively quiet one, the silence only broken by the occasional drunken giggle from Lucy. Halfway through the drive she closes her eyes and reclines her seat back, wrapping herself up in her feathery wings. You can’t help but smile, finding yourself somewhat jealous you’re not wrapped up in those very wings right now. A few minutes later you reach the road that leads to the apartment complex you’d both moved into. It’s a decent spot, certainly better than your old pad on Skin Row. God that place was a fucking shithole; the only time it was ever a home to you was when Lucy was there. You pull up to a vacant parking space near the vast apartment complex, making sure to ride the brakes as gently as you can so as not to disturb the sleeping dino next to you. After putting the car in park, you quietly get out and shuffle to her side. You bend down and slip your arms under her back and legs to pick her up in a bridal carry, still very careful not to disturb her sleep. All the while she still has herself swathed up in her wings. If you’d tried this maneuver when you were eighteen you probably would’ve thrown your scrawny-ass back out.</p><p>With a brisk, steady pace you get home within a few minutes. She isn’t all that heavy; some would go so far as to say it’s like she’s made of feathers. You chuckle at your own joke and she begins to stir a little at the noise. It seems even in her sleep this girl hates your lame wisecracking. Once you reach the apartment door a realization hits you: She has the keys.</p><p>You sit in silent contemplation for a good few minutes. Only when your arm starts to ache does an idea hit you. Very, very gently, you begin adjusting her farther up your forearm, hooking your wrist around her thigh to try and get access to her pocket. With your hand at the precipice of its goal, you look up to gauge her expression, finding that same small smile still plastered on her blissful sleeping face. You snake your hand into her jean pocket, fishing around for purchase before finally finding the key-loop. Bingo! You insert the key into the door handle, twisting it and swinging the door open.</p><p>The scent of fresh-baked cookies wafts over you and you can’t help but smile at the pleasant welcome. Another one of Lucy’s great ideas paying off it seems; putting some vanilla extract in a coffee cup then popping it in the oven really does make a home smell amazing. And judging by the stirring from sleeping beauty, it seems someone’s waking up. You glance down to see Lucy’s open maw in a yawn, rows of her razor-sharp teeth out on full display. “Mmmm…Smells good in here.” she says groggily.</p><p>“Mhm. ‘Nother one of your ingenious ideas paying dividends,'' you snark; a half-sarcastic tone creeping into your voice. She giggles at that and unfurls one of her wings just enough to smack you in the face. You start to put her down, but are met with resistance as she shifts in your arms and looses a disapproving whine.</p><p>“Nuh-uh, you’re carrying me to bed like this, mister.” The will to please your lady outweighs the complaints raised by your aching muscles, and you soldier on past the living room to the bedroom. Pulling the same maneuver from earlier, you turn the knob and use your foot to nudge the door open.</p><p>The room before you is a bit spartan verging on bland, but pleasant memories lining the walls in framed photographs save it from utter austerity. You walk to the bedside and lay your fiancé down on the queen-sized mattress, but before you can pull away Lucy suddenly unswathes herself from her wings and uses the surprisingly powerful appendages to force you into her outstretched arms. She rolls over with you in her grasp, pinning you down against the soft sheets. Just as you open your mouth to protest, you find her snout up against your lips in a fiery kiss.</p><p>Her tongue forces its way into your mouth and begins dancing around your own, the faint yet unmistakable taste of alcohol following it everywhere it touches. For the first few seconds you find yourself completely dumbfounded while she performs her heart out for you. As things settle, though, you begin to reciprocate and lean into the kiss. You go back and forth with her, getting increasingly more domineering with it. She lets out some noise caught in between a moan and a gasp when you push your tongue back against her, forcing hers out and delving deep into her own mouth. As deep as you can go with your relatively short muscle, anyway.</p><p>She breaks off the kiss before you do, catching her breath like she had just run an olympic mile. “You must be as pent up as I am…” she says in a low, breathy tone.</p><p>You don’t bother responding with words, finding yourself wholly starved and craving an intimacy you hadn’t shared with her in far too long. Leaning in, you begin lavishing small kisses across her long snoot, starting next to her nostrils and ending right down next to the edges of her mouth.</p><p>She lets out a randy giggle and starts to push away from you in an attempt to escape your relentless smooching.</p><p>Now’s your chance!</p><p>You use her momentary preoccupation to your advantage, grabbing the surprised pterosaur by the shoulders and flipping her onto her back. Her face is initially one of shock, but it melts away into bliss when you start sucking on her neck like Nosferatu.</p><p>The temptation to rush into lovemaking is nearly overwhelming, but your desire to make this a memorable experience tempers your lust.</p><p>You’re going to give this girl a show.</p><p>A wicked smile tugs at the corners of your mouth and you wordlessly start to unbutton your shirt. Stripping at the pace you’re going is serving as quite the tease for the girl beneath you; Lucy squirms and lets out small coos and satisfied noises for each article of clothing you remove. Stripped down to nothing but your underwear, you begin to help Lucy disrobe, peeling off her blouse to reveal delicate sweat-slicken scales and soft feathers. A glance cast down to her cherry-red bra gives you a mischievous thought.</p><p>You dip down to her bust, take your middle finger and thumb to the clasp of her bra, and snap your fingers. Just like that, the under-garment containing her modesty slacks and loosens allowing you full access to her breasts. Lucy’s now bare chest heaves in anticipation of your next move, the soft moonlight gracing you with the visage of her small but perky breasts, the flesh of her areola and nipples a dark shade of blue. Her eyes dart from your chest down to the erection tenting your briefs and the sound of fabric rubbing together draws your attention directly behind you. Looking over your shoulder confirms your suspicions as you see her thighs twisting around almost of their own volition.</p><p>“Oh G-God, Anon...Please…I can fucking smell you...” She stammers in a heady tone</p><p>Your dick throbs at this declaration and your smaller head deems all foreplay concluded. You start leaving chaste but passionate kisses down her lithe frame starting at her clavicle and ending at her navel before dipping your fingers inside the waistband of her jeans and panties, swiftly pulling down in one fluid motion.</p><p>A satisfied groan escapes from the back of Lucy’s throat as the cool air helps alleviate the blast furnace coming from between her legs. The dark blue color of her lower lips matches that of her breasts and you find yourself staring at her unique sex in a fond familiarity.</p><p>“Dweeb” Lucy says in an irritated huff, resting her hand atop your head before forcing you down in between her thighs with a surprising amount of strength.</p><p>A staggered moan escapes Lucy as your lips make contact with her dripping cunny, thighs tightening around your skull, your nose jammed up against her pubic feathers. The heat and spicy aroma of her aroused sex quickens your heartbeat and you can’t help but to begin licking away at her.</p><p>Your tongue starts in long slow strokes from bottom to top, each time making her moan raise in pitch. To her credit, Lucy was doing more than just sitting there lamely as she began rolling her hips against your eager tongue, spreading her nectar across your face and down your chin. Lucy’s taste begins to drive you mad with desire and you find yourself plunging your tongue into her depths in an attempt for more of it. Your pussy-gobbling zeal earns you muffled but pleasured moans and encouraging tail thwaps against the mattress</p><p>Eventually the supple flesh of her thighs tighten like a vice on either side of your skull and begin to tremble in a sign of a rapidly approaching orgasm, an orgasm that you were going to make explosive. You make it a point to look Lucy dead in the eye as you swap your gentle ministrations to crazed tongue-lashing. Puckering your lips, you take her pearl in your mouth and start madly polishing it with the tip of your tongue.</p><p>And with that her dam broke.</p><p>The sound of fabric tearing reaches your ears through her thin legs though it proves to be an afterthought as a wave of feminine juices hits your face. Lucy thrashes wildly about on the bed making noises you didn’t know she could make, all the while you dutifully continued licking away at her spasming cunt; by the end of it you were on the verge of unconsciousness from lack of oxygen. Once Lucy’s legs relinquish your head you pull back and take a second to catch your breath, each one you take in tasting of Lucy’s tangy essence.</p><p>Lucy sits laying on the mattress in post-orgasmic bliss, dopey grin on her snoot, legs shamelessly spread exposing her glistening navy-colored petals. Your erection aches at the sight of this.</p><p>You wordlessly strip out of your briefs and your cock springs free to the cool air. Lucy looks over to you and her head casts downwards to your unrestrained manhood. Her eyes glance upwards to focus on yours and a look of unmistakable lust is in them. Without skipping a beat, you move in between her legs and rest your glans against her entrance, maintaining eye as you make one fluid thrust of your hips.</p><p>Her sex envelopes your member into her velvety folds and the both of you moan in unison. Lucy’s tightness was something not all that unexpected...But this...This was something else. You start at a slow but steady pace, still gauging the previously fragile girl you had reunited with a few months prior. She hisses through her teeth as you pull out, and lets out a drawn-out groan when your member fills up her passage again. “...Faster, Anon.” she coos</p><p>You’re more than happy to oblige. You pick up the pace with a firm, steady rhythm, falling into it with ease. Each thrust is met with the sound of scales on flesh and a breathy moan from Lucy. You crane down from your midsection and dig your face into her neck, suckling and kissing her neckflesh leaving bright-red hickies; it’s a stark contrast from the rest of her aqua scales. Lucy’s legs wrap around your waist and both of your hands move to find the other’s, intertwining your fingers in a lovingly firm grip. You can feel her walls start to twitch and clamp erratically around your cock, trying desperately to coax a load from you. “I-I’m close, Anon...Don-Don’t stop” she moans. You angle your hips and begin thrusting into her with a hastened pace. Her moaning turned to begging: pleads of “More”, or repeating “Please” over and over again. One last thrust sends Lucy the edge, a long drawn out “Yes” accentuating her peak and the inner walls of her vagina clamp almost painfully around on your dick.</p><p>Lucy spends the next several minutes of her post-orgasm high raking her nails across your broad back in lazy circles, humming to herself the song you wrote together. A dull ache radiating from your crotch brings you out of the pleasant moment as your once rapidly approaching orgasm simmers down to a bad case of blue balls. With a grunt, you withdraw from her depths, cock standing tall and slick with her feminine juices. Lucy takes great notice of this, and she looks up at you with an impish look on her long face.</p><p>“Not done yet, are you?” she asks in a rhetorical manner, flipping onto her stomach and sticking her pert rump high in the air with her stubby tail wagging to and fro.</p><p>Needless to say, you’re on her in a second.</p><p>You plunge yourself back into her with fervor and Lucy practically screams in response to your sudden onslaught, literally biting the pillow and grabbing the sheets as she holds on for dear life. You lean over her trembling frame burying your head face against her plush wings neatly tucked against her back and wrap your arms around her torso, groping her tits and pinching her diamond-hard teats.</p><p>From this angle you manage to stroke against her g-spot with every thrust. Her lips cling to your shaft jealousy as your cock pulls backwards before clenching down invitingly after each thrust, over and over again. The familiar sensation of a coil beginning to tightly wind was beginning to form in the pit of your stomach, and with every thrust it grew tighter. Lucy could feel your dick begin to throb, the prospect of your splooge in her guts proved quite the incentive as she began meeting your thrusts with her own. The feeling of a rapidly approaching orgasm was strong, but another sensation starts niggling in the back of your head; through the lustful haze of it all your inner voice calls to you. At first it’s drowned out by the lurid slaps of your hips slamming together and cries of ecstasy, but it gradually raises in volume until it’s all you can hear:</p><p>“TUG. THE. TAIL”</p><p>You lean back and sit up straight, your hand moves almost out of its own volition and you find it firmly planted against the base of her tail.</p><p>Raptor Jesus, please forgive me for the sin I am about to commit. With a tightened grip around the stubby appendage, you yank on it. Hard.</p><p>Lucy lets loose an ear-shattering scream of pure rapture, her pussy clamps down around you in waves so hard you have to actively push back to avoid being squeezed out. The not-so-gentle ministrations cause the coil in your stomach to come unwound explosively as you cum harder than you’ve ever cummed before, blasting her navy insides a brilliant ivory with your seed.</p><p>A groan comes from Lucy as you withdraw from her battered box and you collapse next to her. As soon as you hit the sheets, Lucy is already swathing you up with her wings in a cocoon of feathers. The next few minutes before succumbing to sleep is spent whispering sweet nothings and exchanging chaste but meaningful kisses.</p><p>Lucy may not have been the same woman you left when those three long years ago, but she’s the one you’ve come to learn and fall for over these past several months. She’s the woman you were ready to spend the rest of your life with, and the woman you’d be there for, no matter what.</p></div>
