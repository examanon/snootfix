A sly smile creeps onto her face as she empties the contents into a smaller can</p><p>>"Stay still."</p><p>>By the time the words register with Anon, she's already upon him, finger wet with paint</p><p>>Surely the stuff they sell at the paint store is less toxic than military grade paint, right?</p><p>>Anon figures these old clothes are ruined anyway. What's the worst she can do?</p><p>>Fang holds Anon's head still with one hand as her painted finger scribes lines and loops onto his face, wiping her finger clean with his shirt after she finishes</p><p>>Guess that's the first thing in the house that's getting christened</p><p>>Fang leans backwards into him as she grabs her phone, it's camera taking a quick picture of the two of them. Another image for the renovation album</p><p>>A snicker escapes her as she inspects her handiwork, angling the camera for Anon to see as well</p><p>>The word 'DWEEB' is written in two parts across his face</p><p>>he can hear Trish's haunting laughter when she sees this photo already. He'd have to get Fang back later. A bit of caulk in a worn out shoe of hers ought to do the trick</p><p>>"A bit of WHAT?!"</p><p>>Fuck. Anon is going to find the descendants of the person who named it caulking of all things and sue for defamation. Get the guy who named asphalt too while he's at it</p><p>>Yes, that's exactly how one pronounces it</p><p>>Fang can't stop laughing as he tries to explain what it means, going so far as to pull out a tube of it from its packaging for inspection</p><p>>It's primary use is to fill gaps in wooden trim and corners, drying to a semi-elastic fill that can stretch and compress as the building weathers the seasons</p><p>>Fang's eyebrows wiggle as she whispers out something else about gaps and caulking</p><p>>Anon's brain can't even begin to catch up and force his mouth to stutter out a response before she strolls out of the room, paint can in hand</p><p>>Good lord what that ptero does to him</p></div>
