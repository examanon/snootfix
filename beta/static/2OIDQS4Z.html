We'll settle this once and for all, ape" - Trish</p><p>That stupid trigger, just what does she have planned?</p><p>I knew Trish had it out for me, but I never expected she would call me out so directly</p><p>Should I really go in? Should I call Reed or Fang for backup?</p><p>No, I must face this alone. Mama didn't raise no bitch</p><p>Mustering all of my strength, I throw open the metal doors as dramatically as possible</p><p>Sadly, the effect is far less impressive than I hoped, the doors barely make back to the walls</p><p>Stupid hydraulic door bullshit</p><p>Trish is standing in the center of the room, looking pissed off and unimpressed as usual</p><p>"Well, I'm surprised you actually had the balls to show up." She glares as the doors swing closed behind me</p><p>"Cut the crap Trish" I retort, trying to sound more confident than I feel, "I'm missing out on some quality shitposting time, so let's make this quick."</p><p>"Fine." She snarls, clenching her fists and stomping up to me. Oh god, those horns could gore me in a second if she wanted to.</p><p>I am totally out of my league here, these noodle arms of mine can't compete with this bundle of pissed off lizard</p><p>"I know why you're really dating Fang." She declares, jabbing an accusing finger into my chest</p><p>The bottom of my stomach drops out. How on earth did she find out about Naomi's bullshit "plan"?</p><p>Has she been spying on me? Did Naomi try to recruit her as well? No, Naomi would never involve Trish in all this</p><p>Just lie Anon, bullshit your way out of this</p><p>"O-oh yeah?" I stammer, trying to keep cool, "And what reason is that?"</p><p>"It's because..." She smirks triumphantly, "You're just a disgusting, dirty degenerate with a dino fetish."</p><p>...What?</p><p>Well, shit. I mean... she's not technically wrong, I guess?</p><p>Damn, did I say that last part out loud?</p><p>C'mon man, get that mumbling under control</p><p>"I knew it." she grins mischievously, "You're just another typical filthy human male enslaved to your own brutish desires. You don't really care about Fang, she's just a trophy to you."</p><p>Holy crap Trish really is a racist cunt</p><p>"So!" Trish continues, flicking her hair and stepping back before I can retort, "You clearly have no self control, and I won't let Fang fall victim to your prolific lust."</p><p>Trish pulls her hoodie up and over her head, tossing it into a heap across the room</p><p>Wait, hold up. What the fuck is happening here</p><p>Without hesitation she grabs the hem of her shirt and hikes it up, revealing a small lavender bra and a cute set of perky, freckled breasts</p><p>What the fuuuuuuck is this?</p><p>"You're not going to get Fang." she declares, jabbing me in the chest with her finger as her breasts push up against my shirt. "Because I'm going to take care of all those filthy urges of yours."</p><p>Holy Raptor Jesus this girl is absolutely fucking nuts</p><p>Did I fall into some race-play fetishist's smut fiction?</p><p>Trish turns around and grabs one of the metal folding chairs nearby.</p><p>Leaning against the back, She thrusts out her ass and arches her back seductively</p><p>Looking over her shoulder at me, she reaches behind her and unclasps the button atop her wildly swishing tail</p><p>The sound of her jeans falling to the floor is like the drop of an atomic bomb, but I'm too far gone at this point to notice</p><p>"You can rut me like a beast in heat as long as you want, you brute." Trish licks her lips in anticipation, her eyes wild and frantic, "But I promise, I won't succumb to your giant monkey dick."</p><p>Man, I was not prepared to deal with this today</p><p>I just want to go home</p><p>I want to go home, crawl in the shower, and scrub these horrible memories away</p><p>"Well, what are you waiting for??" Trish demands, scooting the chair backwards towards me, "Get over here and pin me down. Pump my womb full of your stinking human baby batter! Make me a race traitor!"</p><p>Even from a distance I can see her panties are completely soaked. This crazy bitch is way to into this</p><p>A dedicated team of the nation's top psychologists couldn't unravel the spaghetti pile of deep seated mental issues on full display here</p><p>I only now realize I've subconsciously backed all the way up to the wall, putting this crazy triceratops between me and the only escape from this nightmare</p><p>Trish's breathing is growing more and more frantic, and I can tell she's getting closer and closer to snapping</p><p>If I don't give her what she wants, she likely to just take it by force</p><p>Please Reed, Stella, Rosa, Spears, ANYONE. SAVE ME FROM THIS CRAZY BITCH</p><p>The door flies open and Fang strides in, looking down at a piece of paper</p><p>"Hey Anon, do you want to go over this new science project we got?" She asks, looking up, "I figured we should pick a topic or-</p><p>Oh thank God, it's Fang</p><p>OH GOD FUCK, IT'S FANG</p><p>Fang stares at the ridiculous scene on display in front of her. </p><p>Trish, her oldest childhood friend, is half stripped down and panting like a horny dog while presenting her ass to me, who is pressed up against the wall like a prison inmate mid-escape</p><p>Somewhere in the distance, a pencil falls off a desk</p><p>"This... isn't what it looks like." I manage to choke out</p><p>Actually, come to think of it. This is probably exactly what it looks like</p><p>"Fang!" Trish shouts, turning beet red and jumping up straight. She quickly tries to hide her shame, pulling down her shirt and inching over to her discarded jeans</p><p>"I uh..." Trish stammers, sweating profusely. </p><p>"I mean, this is all his fault!" She points her finger at me, "He cornered me in here and tried to force himself on me!"</p><p>Oh, the sheer audacity of this bitch. I am so getting you back for this one day Trist, mark my words.</p><p>"Really Trish?" Fang crosses her arms, visibly rolling her eyes, "I'm not an idiot. I know exactly what's going on here."</p><p>Thankfully it seems my girlfriend isn't susceptible to B-Tier Hentai plot bullshit</p><p>I might actually make it out of here with my pelvis intact</p><p>"I figured you two would hate-fuck eventually." Fang explains, "About time too, you really need to get it out of your systems."</p><p>...Oh no</p><p>Oh please no Fang, don't abandon me!</p><p>"Anyway, I'll just wait outside until you're done" Fang waves, opening the door and stepping outside, "Have fun you two!"</p><p>Oh lord why have you forsaken me?</p><p>Was it the porn? The shitposting? The vaguely racist memes?</p><p>Trish stares in astonishment as the door clicks shut, unwilling or incapable of comprehending what just happened</p><p>Slowly her gaze returns to me, her eyes once more consumed by insane lust</p><p>Aw, fuck me...</p><p>"That's the idea." Trish grins</p></div>
