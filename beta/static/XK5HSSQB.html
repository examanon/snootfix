Prologue</p><p>Well, it finally happened. I guess everyone's had enough of my shit, and now I'm on my way to some stone quarry town all the way out in the boonies. God damnit, they just couldn't handle one last year of me?! Whatever, Mom and Dad didn't even try to understand me, sending me away to some backwater shithole, saying it's about "Facing the real world", FUCK THAT! Naser and Naomi, the asshole know-it-all's, always in my business, I swear I saw that bitch smile as I was leaving... Rosa and Stella, just a waste of time... Trish and Reed, my band mates and true friends, they understood who we were and knew what we wanted to do! Even if sometimes-</p><p>I'm cut off mid-thought as I'm nearly thrown out the car by someone's reckless driving, "What the fuck! Are you trying to fit in with these hicks already?!" I shout over the squealing tires, gripping whatever handles I can reach as I try desperately to keep myself planted.</p><p>Naser is fully concentrated on the road, getting back into the right lane before he speaks, "Sorry, si-eems, like the roads aren't as maintained-"</p><p>"What's wrong?" I cut him off, "Your car can't handle it out here?" I taunt, still keeping myself semi-braced for another wild maneuver.</p><p>He takes a breath, gripping the wheel for a moment before slowing down to a reasonable speed, relaxing a bit with a sigh, "I don't want to mess with these pot holes, who knows how deep they are! If I hit one, that's it! And do you know how long it would take for-"</p><p>I've already tuned him out as he continues on about boring shit, taking the opportunity to look around now that everything isn't a blur. It seems like I'm trading palm trees and the beach for a bunch pine trees and hills. It's not a very exciting view, but I'm not sure if I'll miss home much either. Friends aside, dealing with everyone else was a pain in the ass. I let out a dejected sigh and check my phone for the weather this week, and see my suspicions confirmed, that it's already colder here than at home. Ffffuck. I also noticed I've somehow missed a few texts from Trish and Reed.</p><p>T "Saw that loser driving you around." "We still good to hang out later?"</p><p>R "heyy, everythin good, dude?"</p><p>T "What's going on?" "Your mom saying you aren't going to VH this year?" "WTF"</p><p>R "u looked kinda down when the nascar went by"</p><p>T "Rock Bottom?" "That's so far away!" "Are you going to come back?"</p><p>R "trish texted sayin ur mom said that ur goin 2 sum other school?"</p><p>T "What about the band?" "This is bullshit!" "Hello?" "Text back when you can, please..."</p><p>R "bruh, thats a bummer, ngl tho, goin to miss u this year, hope u can visit"</p><p>I set my phone aside and rub my temples, goddamnit I don't want to think about this now. But, AUGH! I didn't want any of this shit to happen! Fucking Naomi, that silver-tongued bitch, she had a hand this, I know it! I let out a frustrated sigh and look out again, seeing that the hills and trees have gotten much closer now, and a sign that reads-</p><p>"Rock Bottom," Naser's voice interrupts this time, car slowing down even more now as we pull into the outer limits, "Home of-"</p><p>"A bunch of dumbass hill billies who still eat rocks for a living." I laughed, but I'm still very fucking furious, "Why the fuck am I being moved out here? I didn't even do anything!" I cross my arms and huff, gritting my teeth as I close my eyes.</p><p>Naser is silent for a few moments, before letting out a defeated sigh, "Spears found out that you and your band were the ones that spray painted the school." He squeezes the wheel again, "Lu-ook. Fang. Mom and Dad didn't have a choice," He holds up a hand before I could try cutting him off again, "You of all people should know how much of a hardass Spears is about beautification." He looks around at every sign, making unsure turns, before letting out a frustrated sigh.</p><p>"But why the fuck is it only me getting the boot?! It was the band's ideal!" I can feel the familiar sting of tears forming in my eyes and turn away, putting up a pissed off front as best I can. </p><p>He manages to find a gas station to stop at, but even with nothing distracting him now, he takes his time finding the words, "Because, Spears is very convinced you're the leader..." he constantly clenches his grip on the wheel for a moment, "and as such, he decided that your punishment should be more severe." When I think I have a moment to speak, he suddenly blurts out, "Dad managed to talk him out of charging you all with vandalism." He just stares blankly ahead, tapping the wheel as he's unsure of what to say anymore. It was like he just said something he wasn't supposed to.</p><p>I guess he did, because I couldn't find the words I had before. We sit in an awkward silence, my mind racing with so many thoughts, that just drown the rest of the world out.</p><p>I'm eventually stirred from my thoughts by Naser snapping his fingers in front of me, "Hey, you ok, Fang?"</p><p>"Huh? What?" I look around in a daze and see we're parked at mostly empty street with plain brick buildings on both sides.</p><p>He lets out an apprehensive sigh as he points to the building right next to me, "I said, we're at your apartment. You need any help taking in-"</p><p>"Fuck you, I got it." I've already opened the car door, and the trunk clicks open on cue. I barely manage to hold everything in both arms, making clear as day that I'm not coming back for a second trip.</p><p>He's gotten out to close the trunk, and calls out, "Your room is on the top floor, by the way. Your number and keys are-" </p><p>"I got them right here, dickwing!" I shout back at him as I get to the entryway, fumbling with the door handle a bit.</p><p>I look at his reflection on the window, and see him stand near the driver door, "If you need anything else, you know what to do. We'll visit during winter break, I think." He starts anxiously tapping the roof, "I, I'll miss y-"</p><p>"You can leave anytime...!" I make a flicking motion with my wings, and crack open the door a little. I just want a bed to fall into already, this day has gone on far too long.</p><p>It takes a moment before he finally retreats back into the driver seat, hearing the gears shift and engine roar as he pulls away. When I don't hear the piece of junk anymore, I let out an exhausted sigh, and drag everything I had through the doorway. I'm still lost in thought as I carry everything through the building, my world literally feels like it's on my shoulders by the time I enter my apartment. Finally setting everything down doesn't ease the burden, and as I carry my guitar case to the bedroom, I know don't even have the energy to play.</p><p>I lay the case next to me as I crawl into bed, giving it a tight embrace as I finally let the tears out. God damnit, why am I like this? All I feel I can do now, is to sing some wordless melodies, apart of a song I hear when I get like this. That song is all that brings me peace anymore, letting me slowly drift off to sleep.</p><p>There's nowhere to go but up now, right...?</p></div>
