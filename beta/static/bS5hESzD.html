Is there anything else?"</p><p>>there's not a hint of recognition in those eyes, maybe I did actually change a lot since then</p><p>>but I still wish to see even a spark of the Fang I knew, is that selfish? am I ego-tripping for wanting them to change for me, all over again? after all, my retarded self-centered monkeybrain did fuck us both up way back the-</p><p>>"Oh hey, yeah, holy shit you're Anon, right?"</p><p>>ohshitohshitohshitohshit here it comes, brace for impact, she opens her mouth again</p><p>>"Time flies, how have you been?"</p><p>>she lets out a faint smile, and pops the earbud out, letting it fall and just hang limply on the brim of her DinoMart shirt</p><p>>there's even a faint glint of warmth in her eyes, all of a sudden my anxiety-ridden mind is at ease once more and I can compose myself enough to respond</p><p>>"Yeah, long time no see. It's... Good to see you again, how are you holding up?"</p><p>>"Could be worse, got myself my own flat, some cool instruments, Reed's moved away to work for his dad but me and Trish jam with him over the Dinoscord some times."</p><p>>"Cool, cool... I..."</p><p>>how do you say that you're sorry for such a colossal fuckup</p><p>>I've been dreaming of this moment for years, and here I am stuttering like a broken record once more</p><p>>back to square one, strike three, two yellow cards</p><p>>but it's them that break the silence</p><p>>"So... I'm sorry about how we left things off last time at the pizzeria, I wasn't in a particularly good place back then... Ehm..."</p><p>>it's a bit uncanny seeing them, the once so cocksure goth pthero Fang, struggle with words, but they push through</p><p>>"How about we meet up for a coffee, take a walk some time this week and just clear the air? It's been far too long since last time. I'm free tomorrow, and friday since I work over the weekend."</p><p>>"Sure, tomorrow? I can meet you up at your place, I live in the middle of the city now, ain't much there to see."</p><p>>"Tomorrow's great!"</p><p>>once again, they show that lustrous smile that I thought I'd never see again</p><p>>thinking about it for years, and how I permafucked it, and now I get disproven while buying noodles on a tuesday evening</p><p>>"Here's my address, there's a nice trail there that passes by a park and a café!"</p><p>>after some clarifying directions, we say our awkward goodbyes, and I head to the register</p><p>>I can't believe I'm back to talking with Fang again</p><p>>I can't believe we're meeting up again</p><p>>if I die don't wake me</p></div>
