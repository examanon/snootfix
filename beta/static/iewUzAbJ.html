                    <p>Chapter 2: Carousel of Agony</p><p>​</p><p>Another day, another attempt of trying to go six hours without wanting to blow my brains out. After a relatively uneventful and long walk, I finally approach the school, not particularly bothered with how late I am.</p><p>It's a particularly foggy day out, as the clouds enshroud the sky, giving a degree of eeriness commonly seen in shitty horror movies.</p><p>A thought occurred to me that stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>Weird how I just noticed this now. I didn't see it when I… Wait…</p><p>Why don't I remember leaving my apartment this morning?</p><p>....</p><p>Huh, weird...</p><p>I make my way closer and closer to the school, but a buzz emanates from my pocket, beckoning me to grab my phone and read the notifications.</p><p>A text from Fang?</p><p>"♫Control over my life you denied, and now death approaches from the sky. Why'd it be me you had to vilify? Goodbye Volcano High.♫"</p><p>What the actual fuck?? Something is VERY wrong here.</p><p>I approach the building's entrance with a feeling of uneasiness and dread. The closer I get to the door, the more I notice a disturbing lack of noise from the school. Sure, class has already started, but it's usually still louder than this.</p><p>As my hands grip the door handles, every instinct in my body is telling me to turn back and run away as far as I can. At the same time, my mind is telling me to enter and investigate the building after receiving that cryptic text from Fang.</p><p>Well… No more turning back.</p><p>I open the doors entering the school, my eyes close as my nose is instantly struck with the overwhelming metallic stench of wet ozone, the smell that everyone knows…</p><p>And when my eyes open, I am greeted by the sight of the school's hallway, a place I've made myself familiar with over the past couple of months, navigating through the daily slog…</p><p>My school's hallway, reduced to a mountain of corpses.</p><p>A sinking feeling grasps my heart in horror as my mind begins to process the image in front of me.</p><p>Amidst the sea of red, the remains of countless of my classmates laid across the floor, the light devoid from their eyes like a doll. God no… This isn't real… This isn't real.. This isn't real…</p><p>"No! NO!" A cry emerges from the hallway ahead of me before being cut off by a loud gunshot.</p><p>The shot startled me enough to lose my balance and trip over one of the bodies, falling face first in the puddle of blood.</p><p>I emerge, trying to regain my breath while wiping away the blood off my face. As I can see more clearly, my eyes are caught by the body lying face down to my right, noticing the floral green jacket riddled with bullets and the wings of the corpse being misshapen… Oh no..</p><p>Naser!</p><p>I don't need to turn the body over to know it's him. I'm so sorry, there's nothing I can do.</p><p>I returned my direction to the source of the scream. However, the bodies that lay in front of me became alarmingly familiar.</p><p>Naomi, Rosa, Spears?!</p><p>No, no this isn't real, this is all just a horrible fucking nightmare, and I'm waking up right now, I just have to get out of here.</p><p>I try to navigate through the bloodied corridor, treading carefully to avoid tripping or stepping on my former classmates.</p><p>More and more of the victims become familiar. Reed, one of the few people here who was genuinely nice to me, lying motionless on his back with a bullet hole leaking between his eyes.</p><p>Next to him is the body of his bandmate Trish, crumpled against the wall with a large gunshot in her upper chest.</p><p>None of this makes any sense.</p><p>Why the fuck is this happening? I take a left to follow the source of the cry, and the first thing I notice is how immaculate the hallway looks, contrasting the bloodbath I just exited. No bodies laid scattered across the floor, save for one.</p><p>My gaze spots the puddle of blood growing larger from the green stegosaurus that lay huddled against the lockers, her face stained in tears and her stomach in crimson.</p><p>Stella?</p><p>*BANG* *BANG*</p><p>My observations are cut short as both of my legs crumple underneath, causing me to fall to my knees in excruciating agony, my ears ringing from both shots. The impact of the fall on my shins only intensified the pain…</p><p>"FUAAAA-" I attempt to muster a scream, the pain preventing me from opening my throat further. I can only hyperventilate as the searing white pain ravages my body.</p><p>I hear a pair of footsteps become louder and louder, the sound of leather boats knocking against the hard floor. Fear and sorrow envelopes me further when the figure enters my vision and turns to face me.</p><p>Fang.</p><p>Her wings are bloodied and scattered with bald spots, her arms tense as she grips the revolver in her right hand, the barrel still smoking.</p><p>She remained still and stared me down, eyes full of hatred and malice, her body quivering with rage.</p><p>Millions of emotions go through my mind as my eyes meet the face of my attacker, shock, heartbreak, remorse. The feeling is almost indescribable.</p><p>"F-fang, please… I…" I attempt to weakly muster out, the agony making it difficult to speak coherently.</p><p>"Shut up…" Fang snarls, rage visibly bubbling from her as she raises the pistol towards me. "You made me do this!"</p><p>"And you're gonna get what's coming to you..."</p><p>BANG</p><p>The gunshot causes me to cry out in fear and shoot up, yet I am still alive.</p><p>Additionally, I find myself not surrounded by the bodies of my former classmates but rather in Rosa's living room, drenched in my own sweat on her couch.</p><p>I take a moment to gather my bearings and pull the blankets off of me, revealing that only one of my legs is injured rather than both of them.</p><p>Fucking hell… I told them this is exactly why I try not to sleep. The dreams I've been having are only getting worse and worse.</p><p>Sometimes I'm forced to relieve that day on repeat, watching everyone around me die horribly than the last. Other times, the ghosts that haunt me daily, extending their torment to my dreams too, forcing me to suffer their wrath again and again.</p><p>Well… I'm awake now at least, better get my ass out of bed and see where Stella and Rosa are.</p><p>I take a quick look around the room and spot the desk chair sitting by the coffee table to my right and beside it a pair of crutches leaning against the makeshift wheelchair.</p><p>Seated on the chair laid a note that simply said: "For Anon." I already have a pair of crutches at home. They don't have to give me another pair. I really don't deserve any of this…</p><p>Although I do need them to walk, I grab hold of both of the crutches, position one on each arm, and lift myself off the ground.</p><p>It's awkward, but I manage to support myself with the crutches and put most of my weight on my non-crippled leg.</p><p>It's a little bit since I last used crutches, so I take a few seconds to get a feel for them and make sure I know what I'm doing so I don't fall on my ass.</p><p>I put all of my weight on the makeshift legs and use my right leg to move forward, and shift the weight back to my foot while using the crutches to move forward until I gain a sense of rhythm. Using that formula, I make my way out of the living room and into the corridor of the Castillo household.</p><p>As I make my way towards the kitchen, I examine some of the items that decorate the hallway, photos of Rosa and her family, artwork, religious memorabilia. Nothing too dissimilar to what was in her living room.</p><p>But the table right of the hallway catches my eye and stops me in my tracks, a framed picture of a rather burly-looking older male ankylosaurus, auburn hair with white streaks, a rather bushy beard. He's smiling in the picture with warm eyes, and beside the frame laid two unlit candles and a cross hanging above the photo.</p><p>The realization hits me that the photo on the table is supposed to be a memorial to someone that the Castillo's lost as I notice the words at the bottom of the frame.</p><p>Se ha ido, pero nunca se ha olvidado.</p><p>An epitaph.</p><p>Gone, but never forgotten.</p><p>Was he Rosa's father, her grandfather perhaps? Whoever he was, he must have been a very important man to Rosa and her family.</p><p>My eyes leave the memorial as I enter the kitchen. The first thing I catch is Stella sitting motionlessly at the kitchen table, still wearing the same anime-themed pajamas as last night, holding a warm cup with both hands as Fang aims a revolver towards her head.</p><p>…</p><p>Wait, what?</p><p>Fear enshrouds my heart.</p><p>No no no no no, am I still dreaming? Fang's not supposed to be here.</p><p>All I can do is close my eyes and yell.</p><p>"NOOOOO!!!"</p><p>My terrified scream causes Stella to jump in fear while letting out a scream of her own.</p><p>"EEEEEE!"</p><p>"HEY! ¿QUÉ TE PASA, POR QUÉ GRITAS Y TE PONES ASÍ DE LOCO?!"</p><p>My eyes open to see Stella sitting at the table hyperventilating, her hands grasping a cup of coffee, with Fang nowhere to be seen…</p><p>And now my schizo-tiered outburst has sent the lime stegosaurus into a panic attack.</p><p>"Well?! What do you have to say for yourself An-on?!" I finally take notice of Rosa standing by the stove with a rubber spatula in hand, shooting me an angry glare.</p><p>"I-I'm sorry, I thought I didn't recognize you guys for a second."</p><p>"Dios mio… Are you sure it was just your leg that was broken, not your eyes too?" Rosa shoots a confused glare at my lie.</p><p>Setting the spatula down, she takes a seat at the table to comfort her distraught stego. Head buried in the table, her breathing slowing down as Rosa rubs her shoulder while reassuring her quietly in Spanish. Unlike Stella, Rosa is fully dressed in a crimson hoodie accompanied by a dark black pair of jeans, similar to her outfit from the day prior.</p><p>"Sorry for being retarded, I… had a pretty nasty dream last night." I apologize to the two and make peace. "Let's just say what I saw in the dream made me a little… jumpy this morning."</p><p>Rosa continues her confused stare towards me. However, her demeanor softens as if a light switch went off in her head.</p><p>"Oh sí! I remember you said last night you often had bad dreams, no?" Her face lit up with sympathy as she recalled our previous conversation.</p><p>"Yeah.. This one was pretty bad, I saw it happ-</p><p>"Please… don't..." A muffled yet breathy voice emerges from the startled stego, face still buried in her arms</p><p>My attention is directed towards Stella. Her breathing slows down, and her body relaxes as she looks up to me, face and eyes puffy. Stella's look is filled with a variety of different emotions.</p><p>Discomfort.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>Sympathy.</p><p>Pain.</p><p>"P-please... don't talk about the dream." Her eyes fixated on mine as she requested.</p><p>The day Fang turned Volcano High into a shooting range deeply scarred Stella, whatever happened to her. It seems any mere mention or allusion to what happened that day seems to upset her. Recalling how careful Rosa is when speaking about her friend's mental health or how she would avoid directly happening, just referring to it as 'that day,' it would probably be a smart idea for me to do the same thing.</p><p>They did a lot for me yesterday, even when I didn't deserve anything, the least I could do is not be a dick.</p><p>"Sorry, Stella… I won't." I directed my words towards the disturbed stego as I took a seat at the table, then glanced at both of them. "And I'm sorry for scaring you both, I-I didn't mean to."</p><p>Stella replies to my apology with a gentle nod. Rosa's expression eases as a slight smile appears across her face.</p><p>"Está Bien An-on, it happens." Rosa reassures me. "So, how is your leg feeling this morning, and how do the crutches help?"</p><p>My leg?</p><p>Well, it still feels like it's about to fall apart at a moment's notice. But it's not as painful as it was yesterday, I suppose… I probably should be wearing a cast, but a doctor can only have so many medical supplies in her house…</p><p>Still, it's not the leg I'm worried about.</p><p>"A-Anon?" Stella's words snap me back to reality.</p><p>"Huh? O-oh uhh, it still hurts a little bit, but I do feel a little bit better today." I attempt to answer their concerns with a half-truth, but they don't seem to be convinced by my summary.</p><p>Then a brief silence follows as Rosa tries to analyze my words while Stella goes back to her drink.</p><p>"So.. How did you guys sleep last night?" I ask both of them, trying to change the topic and break the silence.</p><p>To my surprise, Stella is the first one to answer my question as she sets her cup down and looks back at me.</p><p>"I couldn't… sleep last night, so I just watched more episodes of this new anime I'm checking out called Vinland Saga." Stella's expression brightens, contrasting the frightened state she found herself moments prior. "It's a really cool show, and it's about Vikings and stuff!"</p><p>Huh, I find it hard to wrap my head around Stella watching any anime that isn't magic girl or fujoshi shit, let alone one about Vikings. I guess a lot can happen in six months.</p><p>"Uhhh cool, Stella!" I manage to choke out, not really sure where to direct the conversation next. "How uh.. How far did you get?"</p><p>"Ay Niños, as fun as this topic is for all of us, I'm afraid we have to leave very soon!" Rosa interjects after glancing at her phone, why does she need to leave so early?</p><p>"If I'm going to drop you and Stella home and make it in time for school, we have to leave now An-on!"</p><p>Why couldn't the part of my brain that causes me to mumble like a dumbass get broken rather than my leg?</p><p>Ehh never mind about that, It completely slipped my mind that it was a Monday today and that Rosa is still going to Volcano High.</p><p>"Oh r-right, I forgot about that. Busy day today, Rosa?" I ask as the focused ankylosaur begins gathering the books and notes that are scattered on the table.</p><p>"Sí! I have a test for my morning class, a student council meeting at lunch, and I also have to work with the gardening club after school!" Rosa explains, a hint of weariness gripping her voice, it can't be easy having that much responsibility.</p><p>Not that I would know, obviously.</p><p>"That sounds pretty productive…. How about you Stella, what are your plans?" I direct my question towards the somber stego, who I caught mid-sip of her drink.</p><p>Stella, caught off guard by the question, started to choke on her coffee and began coughing, with Rosa patting her back as she gave a slight chuckle.</p><p>"Ohh uhh… I-I don't know yet…" She answered with uncertainty, her voice sounding hoarse after substituting coffee for oxygen.</p><p>But it's not like I can't relate with that. I've got no fucking clue what I'm gonna do when I get home.</p><p>"How about you An-on? What will you do?" Rosa questions me, seemingly reading my mind.</p><p>"Me? I'll uh… I…" I struggle to answer. Rosa makes it sound like she's asking for my plans for today, but I know full well that question has a broader meaning.</p><p>What can I say other than what I've already been doing for the past five months? Just withering away in my apartment while I aimlessly scroll the internet and replay Rock Ring on repeat until my eyes bleed?</p><p>'I… I don't know yet."</p><p>"G-glad to see I'm not alone there." Stella uncharacteristically responds with a hint of sarcasm. I don't think I've ever seen her use sarcasm before.</p><p>"No importa, the day has only just begun. I'm sure you two will figure out what you want to do eventually!" Rosa chimes in as she rises from the table, clearly ready to depart. "But we have to leave now if we're going to make it on time!"</p><p>"Okay, I just need to put on some clothes first." Stella sheepishly asks as she exits the room, understandably since oversized weeb shirts and cat slippers typically don't make the best public outfit.</p><p>Wait, this gives me an idea.</p><p>"Uhh, I just gotta use the bathroom first if that's cool?"</p><p>"Por supuesto An-on, just be as quick as you can!" Rosa excuses me, prompting me to rise from the table albeit awkwardly due to the crutches and hobble myself into the hallway.</p><p>I probably should have asked where exactly the bathroom was since I didn't have to use it at all last night. I see two of the doors on each side of the makeshift memorial.</p><p>Taking a lucky guess, I open the door on the left only to see a closet, filled with a couple of coats, boots, and a plaque obscured by the various articles of clothing, only the name visible.</p><p>Sebastián Castillo.</p><p>Gathering from what little I can see of the plaque, it looks like some kind of award, so why would something seemingly prestigious be hidden away in a closet?</p><p>I probably shouldn't even be looking in here…</p><p>I close the door as quietly as I can, not to let Rosa know that I am violating her family's privacy. I carefully step away from the closet and then make my way over to the door on the right, successfully locating the bathroom this time.</p><p>Compared to the rest of their house, the bathroom does seem rather plain. Rather than the colourful decorations and Latin memorabilia, the room is adorned with a mirror, soap, drawers, a sink, and of course, a toilet. The latter of which isn't why I went to the bathroom…</p><p>I'm a piece of shit for doing this...</p><p>Locking the bathroom door, I began to check the cabinets below the sink for any trace of pills, painkillers, Ambien, Adderall. Hell, I'll even take some random prescription meds as long as it makes me fall asleep.</p><p>But all I find is just some extra rolls of toilet paper and a bottle of wakinodex. Standard bathroom appliances…</p><p>The objects stare at me as if they're mocking me for not failing to find my treasured resource or how I'm raiding my friend's cabinet for a quick fix. I wonder if I'd be able to-</p><p>*KNOCK* *KNOCK*</p><p>"Vamos An-on! We need to go now!" Rosa's voice bellows from the door.</p><p>Never mind…</p><p>"Uhhh sorry, coming!"</p><p>I flush the toilet and run the sink to not arouse any further suspicion, and then unlock the door to see a particularly impatient ankylosaur, holding a backpack in one hand and a pair of car keys in the other.</p><p>"Ready now?" She asks before moving towards the door.</p><p>"Y-yeah sorry about that… Wait, where's Stella?" I ask as I shut the bathroom door and follow her throughout the hallway</p><p>"¿Dónde crees? She's in the car waiting for us!" She turns around to face me with a scowl. The sudden hostility from Rosa catches me off guard, stopping me in my tracks while trying to keep myself standing with the crutches.</p><p>Rosa's scornful look quickly evaporates and turns into one of remorse, as if she realized the words that just came out of her mouth.</p><p>"Lo… Lo Siento An-on, I've just been dealing with a lot right now… With school, work, life, figuring out what I want to do once I graduate."</p><p>And having to hang around two emotionally broken teenagers.</p><p>"I shouldn't have snapped at you like that. I'm sorry…." Rosa sighs as her body relaxes.</p><p>Rosa definitely seems a lot more patient than I remember. If I recall correctly, she threatened to kick my ass with the dreaded chancla after falling the school garden's flowers, or how I couldn't find Fa-</p><p>...After I couldn't do what she asked, and now she's been nothing but understanding to me, patient, kind, and to me of all people? Why?</p><p>"Let's get going, sí?"</p><p>Thankfully I don't think I mumbled that out loud…</p><p> </p><p>About 15 minutes pass as we drive further into Volcadera Bluffs. Since Rosa lives on the outskirts of the city, the drive is a bit long but enjoyable. I've been continuing my earlier conversation with Stella about that new anime she's been watching. It's almost… refreshing to see her cheer up compared to the downtrodden state I've usually seen her in.</p><p>"And then he meets this really big Viking guy who was friends with his father, like he's really strong too, and there's this one part where he even uppercuts a horse!"</p><p>Even Rosa chimed into the conversation, which surprised me since I didn't take her as one who would partake in anime.</p><p>"There's no way he could beat Goku or Naruto!"</p><p>Raptor Jesus… And I thought Stella had normie taste…</p><p>But still, it's just nice to be able to have a conversation with another living being, not just a loser behind a screen, and certainly not the dead. Is this what it feels like to have friends again?</p><p>Even before coming to Volcadera Bluffs, I hadn't had a friend for a long time. After the incident, I came to the conclusion that friendship would once again be nothing but a distant memory to me.</p><p>But I'm still not sure what to make of this. Both of them did more than enough for me, especially Rosa. And I repaid her by trying to steal medicine from her family, some fucking 'friend' I am. A part of me just wanted to see this as a one-time thing. They only helped me out of pity. They didn't need leaving a former classmate to rot on the street hanging on their conscience.</p><p>But… Another part of me doesn't want to let go of that and believes that their intentions were genuine.</p><p>As the roads slowly transition from rural to urban as we make our way into the heart of Volcadera Bluffs, and after few turns into converging neighbourhoods, Rosa pulls into a driveway which can mean we have arrived at Stella's house.</p><p>A clean three-story house of modern design, accompanied by a Hadro Civic sitting in the driveway and a well-maintained garden facing the house. Not unlike Rosa's house, a part of me forgot that Stella is also a skilled green thumb like her best friend.</p><p>"Thanks again Rosa, I appreciate you helping me out and having me over!" said the Lime Stego in a rather cheerful manner as she unbuckled her seatbelt and grabbed her bag, but not before turning back to me.</p><p>"And it was great seeing you again Anon, I hope we can talk again sometime."</p><p>Why would you want to talk to me, though?</p><p>"Y-yeah, me too. It was great seeing both of you again." I muster out to Stella</p><p>"Would it be okay if we exchanged numbers so we can talk?"</p><p>Wait…</p><p>The retarded half of me is saying 'lawl a girl is trying to get my number' whereas the realist part of me is trying to find a way to refuse so I can just wither away some more.</p><p>"Oh, si! That's a great idea, An-on let's exchange numbers too so we can stay in touch!"</p><p>I guess I don't have much choice in the matter, don't I? Ehhh, I suppose it's the least I could do.</p><p>I comply and spell out my phone number both to them, prompting them to send me a text message to add them back.</p><p>'Hola An-on, Rosa here!'</p><p>'Astrology reveals the will of the gods.'</p><p>Two text messages that perfectly describe the two...</p><p>"It was nice to see you again Stella, I hope you have a good one" I wave goodbye as she exits the car and enters her house, her body language slightly more cheery and positive than the morning I saw her as.</p><p>"Okay An-on, where do you live?"</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>"Uhhh about that… I-"</p><p>"Vivir en Skin Row? I already know that." Rosa lets out a chuckle. "I mean what is your address?"</p><p>I hope she's okay with this…</p><p>I tell her my address, and to my surprise, she doesn't object to driving her car to one of the shittest and most dangerous parts of town. Even the taxi driver wouldn't dare set foot there.</p><p>"No te muevas, we'll be there soon!" Rosa chirps from the driver's seat.</p><p>Enjoying the ride, I lean my head back against the seat and look towards the window to my right, wishing to see the city pass by as the car moves.</p><p>However, I see a familiar face staring back at me rather than my own reflection. The face shoots a smug smile, contrasting my disturbed face.</p><p>"Christ, bad enough you fucked everything up with Fang and me. But now you're gonna drag Stella and Rosa into your shit too?"</p><p>Naser, why are you here? Why now?</p><p>No no no no no, go away.</p><p>"What's wrong? Too scared to face the consequences of your actions?" Naser seemingly replies to my own thoughts with a laugh and flashes a smug smirk in my direction. "I knew you were a pussy, but I didn't think you were this sad."</p><p>No, none of this is real. The Naser I knew wouldn't talk like this, nor would he be this vindictive.</p><p>"Aww, am I being too mean? Maybe if you weren't such a shitty friend to everyone around you, maybe they wouldn't be so 'vindictive.'" Naser pointed his finger at me through the reflection while echoing the last word in a mocking tone.</p><p>"So… Be honest with me here, are you gonna let them die too?"</p><p>Please… No no no no</p><p>"Like you did with me?"</p><p>Stop…</p><p>"Leave me THE FUCK ALONE!"</p><p>It takes me a second to realize that I said these words aloud, as the car suddenly came to a stop, and a rather confused voice called out from the driver's seat.</p><p>"¿Qué demonios? An-on what's wrong?" Rosa asks with a confused tone as she turns around to face me.</p><p>Shit… How do I even explain this?</p><p>"Sorry Rosa, I uh… thought I saw a bee."</p><p>"A bee?" Rosa replies flatly. "Did you also see a bee this morning in the kitchen? Por favor, tell me what's wrong."</p><p>Oh, it's nothing, Rosa! Just your average hallucination! Don't worry about it. I'm just a schizo having arguments with dead people. Everything's perfectly fine here!</p><p>"Hallucinations?" Rosa inquires with a degree of shock and concern.</p><p>Fuck. I mumbled that… Well, I guess I HAVE to explain now…</p><p>"Okay… Okay… I'll tell you everything, Rosa, but let's continue on the road."</p><p>Rosa agrees with a nod before shifting the car from 'park' to 'drive', which kind of surprised me a bit since I thought she would refuse and stop the car to hear the whole conversation first.</p><p>"Okay An-on, tell me everything."</p><p>I let out a defeated sigh.</p><p>"I still see Fang every day… Naser and Naomi too, they visit me… To remind me of all the mistakes I've made, and how I let them die."</p><p>Rosa's face has a mixture of shock and confusion, evidenced by her reflection in the driver's mirror.</p><p>"They… visit you?" she inquired.</p><p>I nod. "I mean… Yes and no, I know they're dead, but it still feels real, and they come to haunt me by reminding me of how badly I fucked up, how everyone died because of my actions." I explain, exhaustion plaguing my voice.</p><p>"That's why I freaked out in the kitchen, I dreamed last night that Fang shot up the entire school, and I mean the entire school. But when I woke up, I saw Fang aiming a gun at Stella's head."</p><p>I can hear Rosa mutter something in Spanish while behind the wheel, clearly shocked by my revelation.</p><p>"Dios mío... And, you've been having these nightmares and hallucinations since?" she inquires, sadness and sympathy plaguing her voice, I see the conflict on her face from the driver's mirror, as if she wants to stop the car.</p><p>I answer her question with a nod of my head.</p><p>"Yeah, It started after around the time I left the hospital. I visited the cemetery and watched Fang and Naser's funeral, from a distance, of course… I didn't deserve to be there. I've made them all suffer enough." I confess while fighting every urge in my body, begging me to stop talking. "And… When I got home that night, that's when I first saw Fang. She just stood there, leering at me, eyes full of contempt and hate."</p><p>"If it weren't for me, she'd still be alive, they'd all still be alive-"</p><p>My confession is interrupted as the car comes to a sudden stop and Rosa raises her voice from behind the wheel.</p><p>"¡Ni una palabra más!"</p><p>Rosa unbuckles her seatbelt and turns from the driver's seat, facing me. Her face full of sadness, concern, anger, and her eyes were on the verge of tears.</p><p>"I told you! None of this is your fault An-on!" Rosa shouts, slapping her hand against the glovebox, emphasizing her point. "Fang was a monstruo. She always has been! You couldn't have stopped her. Nobody could."</p><p>She's wrong. She wasn't a monster, not to me… She was just… lost…</p><p>Rosa stretches out her left hand past her seat and takes hold of my own left hand, giving it a tight squeeze.</p><p>"You're not alone An-on, No más." Gazing into my eyes deeply as her voice breaks slightly. "Fang… Era pura maldad.""</p><p>"But-" I attempt to interject before being cut off.</p><p>"Fang made YOU suffer, not the other way around!" She tightens her grip on my hand, accidentally causing a small amount of pain.</p><p>"You don't have to hide your pain, not with me, not with Stella. We're here for you."</p><p>You are?</p><p>"Of course, para qué sirven los amigos?" I apparently mumbled that out loud as Rosa's lips creep into a smile. "Before you woke up, Stella was telling me just how happy she was that we found you again. We were so worried about what happened to you after the shooting!"</p><p>"I haven't seen that happy in a long time An-on."</p><p>"Really, me? Why?" I ask.</p><p>"I can't say too much, but…." Rosa hesitates before finding the right words. "Stella sees a bit of herself in you, and it makes her happy to see that there's someone she can relate to."</p><p>Someone she can relate to… Wait, is she referring to Stella's anime obsession? Plus, I'm pretty sure Stella enjoys gardening too.</p><p>"Wait, she can't relate to you? I thought you guys were best friends?"</p><p>"Oh, we are for sure, she's like a Hermana to me!" Rosa's face lights up, seemingly worried that I got the wrong idea from her statement. "But you know, she has her passions, and I have my own."</p><p>"De todos modos, I wanted to ask. Stella and I are planning to get lunch on Friday, and we wanted to ask if you would like to come?"</p><p>They want me to come to lunch with them?</p><p>I mean… Money is really tight right now, I can't really afford to be blowing it all on eating out.</p><p>But it was nice to see them again, I still don't know what to make of this but… Part of me wants to see them again, and to know that I won't be alone.</p><p>"Y-yeah. I'd like that Rosa."</p><p>Delight washes across the ankylosaur's face as she finally lets go of my hand, leaving behind a slight shade of blue across the skin.</p><p>"Maravilloso! I'll be sure to fill you in all the details soon!" Rosa turns back to face the windshield and adjusts the car from park to drive as we continue our journey to Skin Row.</p><p>As I'm contemplating her words and her invitation, a new wave of emotions washes over me, contrasting the ones that have plagued my mind for the past five months.</p><p>Anticipation, satisfaction, perhaps even joy?</p><p>I'm not alone anymore?</p><p>One day earlier…</p><p>Those eyes look up at me, begging, fucking pathetic.</p><p>"W-wait-"</p><p>Fuck you...</p><p>"SHUT THE FUCK UP!"</p><p>*THUD*</p><p>I slam the metal bat against his chest, again and again, each swing more brutal than the last. This bastard fucking dies today.</p><p>*THUD* *THUD* *THUD*</p><p>"You took everything away from me!" I roar with hate. "Just fucking die! Skinnie piece of shit!"</p><p>I get a couple of swings against his leg for good measure, I hear a sharp crack as the metal meets his skin. Good…</p><p>Fuck he's passed out, no good.</p><p>"Get the fuck up!" I shout at the grovelling little monkey giving him a kick in the groin. "I need you awake for this."</p><p>I raise the baseball bat towards his head, and before I can bash his brains out, a voice calls out from the car behind and distracts me.</p><p>"R-rosa!"</p><p>Is that.. Stella?</p><p>""¡OYE! ¡ALÉJATE DE ÉL!"</p><p>W-what? Rosa?</p><p>*HONK* *HONK* *HONK* HONK*</p><p>Fucking hell, everyone in the ass-end of skin row is gonna hear that, I gotta get out of here.</p><p>I don't wanna leave my work unfinished... But I'll find him again.</p><p>I give him a sharp kick to the leg again, causing him to cry out and take off as quickly as I can, taking a quick turn into the alleyway to my right.</p><p>I don't know if they're following me or not, so I instinctively take cover behind one of the dumpsters, fuck everyone who ever talked shit about me being short.</p><p>I wait a few moments, anticipating the footsteps of my pursuers to become louder and louder. Still, all I hear is the distant yelling of Spanish?</p><p>"¿QUÉ ESTÁS HACIENDO? ¡VEN Y AYÚDAME A METERLO EN EL COCHE! ¡AHORA!"</p><p>I don't speak Spanish, so I can only assume Rosa's calling me out. Fucking cunt, why would she and Stella save a worthless human who did nothing but cause misery for everyone around him? It's a mystery to me.</p><p>"Don't just stand there! Help me get him to the van, Vamos!"</p><p>Wait… They're not coming after me?</p><p>My suspicions come true as ears are greeted by the obnoxious sound of rubber hitting the cracked pavement road as the tire's screeching becomes fainter and fainter. I can only assume they're gone now.</p><p>Fuck the both of them, fuck Anon, fuck that weirdo anime-loving stego bitch, and fuck that stupid religious fascist.</p><p>The heavy painting caused by my adrenaline quickly turns into rage. Why couldn't I finish the job? Why couldn't I make things right for Fang?</p><p>My grip on the bat tightens.</p><p>WHY COULDN'T I JUST FUCKING KILL ANON?? GODDAMNIT!</p><p>The dumpster echoes throughout the alleyway with a 'twang' sound as I take out my rage by beating the object as hard as I can.</p><p>*TWANG*</p><p>FUCKING!</p><p>SKINNIE!</p><p>BASTARD!</p><p>And then, as if I had the wind knocked out of me, I dropped the bat to the ground, and I'm left with exhaustion as I seethe with cold hatred.</p><p>And beneath that, sorrow.</p><p>No friends left, the family wants nothing to do with me, no real future, and Fang is gone… Forever…</p><p>This world is nothing but a black pit, filled with the shittiest of people.</p><p>...The job's not over yet. I still have work to do.</p><p>I crouch down and reach under the dumpster to pull out a worn black duffel bag, the kind that hockey players usually use to store their equipment.</p><p>I still can't believe I had to wear this ridiculous fucking outfit when I pulled this job. Raptor Jesus, I look like a character from one of Riley's video games.</p><p>No time better than now to get this shit off, I remove the paintball mask first as the cold wind hits my face, kissing my scales with its cool icy wind.</p><p>Dropping the mask as it lands into the bag, I began taking off all the other articles of my clothing, along with the steel-toed boots I was wearing, leaving me standing in an alley in my socks, wearing nothing but a tank top and some light shorts. It also doesn't help that I'm doing all of this during a particularly cold autumn night in a dark alleyway.</p><p>Eager to warm myself up, I unzip the bag, revealing a clean pair of clothes consisting of my favorite yellow hoodie accompanied by my typical track pants and red boots, my typical outfit. Also one of the only things I could grab when I left home.</p><p>I begin to dress myself rather as quickly as I can while hiding behind the dumpster, I don't want some perv to see me half-naked in an alleyway. The cold makes it difficult to move my arms around the hoodie and properly fit them in.</p><p>After rather hastily getting dressed, all that's left to put everything away.</p><p>I pick up the bat, noticing the slight blood stains on it. I begin to carefully 'wrap' with the getup I just disguised myself in, kind of like a Christmas present.</p><p>After putting the clothes away and zipping the bag shut, all that's left is to head to Lil Tru' and get rid of this shit.</p><p>And go to one of the few places that haven't abandoned me.</p><p>About an hour passes, and I finally enter one of the livelier areas of Little Troodon. This part of town kind of reminds me of home, making me feel at ease, even if only briefly.</p><p>Approaching the end of the street corner, I turn around and instantly spot my destination.</p><p>Dino Moes</p><p>As I approach the restaurant entrance, I glance through the windows to see the establishment filled almost to its entirety.</p><p>I'm honestly surprised. Why the hell are there so many people here on a Sunday night? Just what I fucking needed, an entire building full of people to see some 'triceratops thug' carry a duffel bag containing a bad Halloween costume and a bloody bat.</p><p>Let's just get this over with…</p><p>I enter the restaurant, opening the door with one hand, carefully not to hit the door with my bag, a bell rings at my arrival and my nostrils are hit with the overwhelming scent of cheese, tomato sauce, and meat. Carnivore meat.</p><p>"Welcome to the historic Dino-Moes, table for one?"</p><p>A human woman calls to me with an unenthusiastic expression. Dressed in a typical apron and hat with the Dino Moes logo.</p><p>"I'm here to see the manager." I reply curtly.</p><p>"Okay, hang on." she turns to her left and calls out. "We got a code K at the front desk!"</p><p>"A KAREN?!I'M COMIN! I'M COMIN!"</p><p>Code K… Did this bitch just call me a karen? I've had enough monkeys to deal with today already.</p><p>Finally, the jolly-looking Tyrannosaurus Rex comes from around the corner where the server was looking.</p><p>"AY TRISH! GOOD TO SEE YA, JUST COME IN MY OFFICE IN DA BACK, I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YA!"</p><p>"Will do Moe." I dryly nod as I begin to heed his direction, passing by all of the tables of people having their dinner as they stare at me.</p><p>What the fuck are they looking at? 'Oh no triceratops, she's gonna ruin our shitty dinner.' It takes all that I have to resist the urge to tell these shitheads off.</p><p>I finally entered the room in the back to see a rather well maintained and clean office, compiled with a filing cabinet, some shelves containing various awards and framed newspapers, with of course some booze. Centered against the wall laid a rather clean-looking oak desk, the only objects on it were a filing board and two glasses.</p><p>I'm surprised Moe manages to keep this place so clean, considering those arms of his.</p><p>I sit in the chair adjacent to the wall as I continue to wait for the lively Tyrannosaurus Rex.</p><p>I'm overwhelmed with the thoughts that have been racing through my head the past few days. Are my siblings okay? Why isn't Reed answering my texts?</p><p>Why couldn't I kill that Skinnie bastard?</p><p>I had him right where I wanted him, but before I could finish things, those two goodie losers from school showed up and ruined things. Why would they even want to protect a piece of shit like him?</p><p>Anon. Ruined. Everything. He took Fang away from me.</p><p>Fang, my bandmate, my best friend, my l-</p><p>"ALRIGHTYS, sorry bout dat! Just had ta deal wit' some tables, ya know how it is." Moe finally enters the office, interrupting my contemplation.</p><p>I turn around to see the usually 'larger than life' grin from the restaurant's owner dissipates to a rather calm one, betraying his usual persona as the door closes.</p><p>"So… Did ya do it?"</p><p>"Yup." I nod as I unzip the duffel bag to show the blood-stained bat, along with the shitty disguise.</p><p>Moe lets out a deep sigh as he walks over to the shelf and grabs a bottle of whiskey.</p><p>"Y'know, we normally don't serve unda-aged patrons here, but you'se looks like you'se could some." He offers as he brings the bottle back to his desk, setting it by the glasses in front of me.</p><p>"I'm not a patron."</p><p>"Heh, I beg ta differ, considering all the jobs you'se taken from me the past two months!" He chuckles as he pours the whiskey into the glasses, filling them both with auburn ambrosia. But not before placing an envelope in front of me, I can briefly make out shades of green through the paper.</p><p>"You know I didn't do this for the Money."</p><p>"Yeah, but you'se be an idiot not to take it." Moe shrugs before his look becomes more serious. "Look, let me be real with you, kid."</p><p>"Da only reason I had you'se do dis was cause I owed a buddy a favour, not that ol' Moe here had much choice." He explains. "Hopefully now dat you taught dis punk a lesson, he won't be a problem for im no' more."</p><p>"If you didn't want him to be a problem anymore, you should have given me a gun, not a bat."</p><p>My retort elicits a groan from Moe in response as he begins to rub his eyes while struggling to do so.</p><p>"Look, kid, we've already been over dis. You've done good work so far, offerin' security and whatnot. But I don't need a hitman."</p><p>Fucking coward, of course he doesn't have the balls to see what needs to be done.</p><p>"You're kidding, right? That piece of shit deserves to die, if it weren't for him Fang would still be alive-</p><p>"LISTEN!-" Moe's voice bellows through the office, cutting me off.</p><p>"Listen… I mean, yeah, maybe you'se right and he is a piece a'shit."</p><p>Maybe? He IS that and more.</p><p>"But dis obsession of yours with dat Anon kid isn't healthy. It's gonna eat ya up, but it's not too late! You'se a good kid, you'se can stop takin' jobs from me and get back on da right path." Moe attempts to convince me.</p><p>"It's not too late to take back ya life."</p><p>What the hell does he know? I pick up the glass and down the entire glass. The harsh liquid trickling down my throat helps ease my nerves before sitting it back down on the desk.</p><p>"My life ended a long time ago, Moe."</p><p>I proceed to stand up and walk towards the exit, but I call out before I open the door.</p><p>"I'll be back next Friday."</p><p>My response elicits yet another sigh from him as he further deflates in his desk and picks up his own glass.</p><p>"Yeah, sure. Be seeing ya Trish."</p><p>I exit back into the restaurant and close the door behind me. Doing my best to avoid looking at those nosy pricks at the tables as they glance my way with judging eyes. What the hell do they know?</p><p>"Have a good day." The skinnie server calls to me with a dull expression as I promptly ignore her and walk out the door, once again ringing the entry bell.</p><p>Now that that's dealt with, I just want to get back to my apartment and not have to worry about anyone else, Moe and his high and mighty bullshit, or Reed just being high in general.</p><p>After what happened that day, Reed really started to lose himself with that carfe shit. I'm not even sure how much of him is left to be honest. Eh, hopefully, he should be preoccupied when I get back though.</p><p>As I walk home through the dark streets of Little Trodon, my mind continues to be overwhelmed as I'm reminded by just how shitty life has been.</p><p>After I proved to be disappointing as always, my family threw me away, failing school and just being a shitty sister.</p><p>The former has been particularly fucking me over the most. Not many places want to hire a triceratops dropout. 'Oh I'm just another bad egg! I'm just gonna cause trouble!' Fuck all of them.</p><p>And worst of all, that fucking skinnie still lives. Who the fuck does he think he is? He comes out of nowhere and ruins VVURM DRAMA, destroys everything we had, and…</p><p>He took Fang away from us… from me…</p><p>I loved them… more than anything else, and he fucking killed them.</p><p>I swear, I will find him again, and I will bash his brains out when I find him next.</p>
