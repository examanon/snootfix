                    <p>Title: A Look Beyond The Shore</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Trish, Reed</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>Inhale...</p><p>A slow sigh...</p><p>This simple action allowed Anon to take everything in. The savory smell of the salt water, the whistling winds flowing by everyone's ears, the cawing of the seagulls, and the perfect air brought him a wonderful feeling of content that he unfortunately hasn't felt in a while. With everything in mind though, he wouldn't trade this for the world. He had the girl, he had the ones who would always watch his back, and he had the bright future ahead of him now.</p><p>Everyone's decked out in their own special outfits, too. Trish is in an all-black swimsuit with an eye-catching lei flourishing with a heavy variety of colors, Reed's in a simple white tank top with black swim trunks and shades glowing with a vaporwave-esque color palette, Fang's in a one-of-a-kind VVURM DRAMA top with fire in the background along with a swimsuit of her own underneath. Anon's in a jacket like Naser's with grey and red swim trunks.</p><p>Reed takes another inhale with his boof, smiling as he does so before glancing to Anon.</p><p>“Hey, man…”</p><p>“…I’m glad you’re here with us.”</p><p>“You’ve changed us, man. What we have right now… it’s something that we’ve been missing.”</p><p>“We didn’t really have a sense of direction. We didn’t know where to go.”</p><p>“You… did so much for us all. Our band is starting to thrive, our relationship is stronger than ever…”</p><p>“I can’t thank you enough.”</p><p>“I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</p><p>Reed slowly wraps his arms around Anon, letting out a stoned sigh as he does so. </p><p>This is nice….</p><p>Anon happily wraps his arms around Reed, not bothered by the heavy smell of weed invading his nostrils. Trish notices this, and she can barely contain her excitement by the look on her face. Her tail is wagging incredibly fast, too.</p><p>Does she ship this or something?</p><p>“Guys…”</p><p>Anon and Reed let each other go with a happy sigh as Anon continues.</p><p>“This has truly been a wonderful adventure. You’ve all given my life meaning. Before you all came along… I had no idea where I was headed. Now, I have a great future of me and the best group of friends that any person could ask for.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t trade you all for the world.”</p><p>A moment of happy silence follows. Everyone is touched by Anon’s words, and it shows.</p><p>“Stupid skinnie…”</p><p>A curious Anon looks at Trish, waiting for her response.</p><p>“Ugh… I can’t believe I used to hate you. I tried pushing you away, and… I wasn’t seeing what I could have missed.”</p><p>“You’ve grown on me, you idiot…”</p><p>Trish wipes away a tear with a closed hand and sniffles. Anon starts to feel witty as he responds himself.</p><p>“What’s wrong, trigga? Couldn’t get enough of me?”</p><p>She quickly jabs Anon in the gut, forcing a laugh out of everyone.</p><p>“OW!”</p><p>“You deserve that, prick.”</p><p>“Yeah… I probably did.”</p><p>“Heh, can’t believe I used to call you that…”</p><p>Anon turns his head to Fang, with a true smile on his face.</p><p>“I wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for you.”</p><p>“I love you, Fang.”</p><p>Anon makes his way to Fang and embraces her with his head on her shoulder. Fang lets out a small chuckle as she practically cradles Anon with her arms and enveloping him with her wings.</p><p>“Love you too, dork…”</p><p>The feeling of Fang’s embrace combined with the texture of the wings surrounding Anon makes the world around him melt into nothing. It was almost as if he had prematurely entered heaven. It was at this moment that Anon knew that everything would be okay.</p><p>Another long silence follows as everyone takes in the world around them. Nothing could possibly ruin what they had right in front of them. Time seems to slow down as senses enhance and envelop the moment. After what felt like a welcome eternity, Anon and Fang let go of their embrace as he speaks up once more.</p><p>“With whatever I may be doing in the future, I don’t want to do it without you all.”</p><p>“I had been thinking about joining the Navy for a while, but it seems impossible because you wouldn’t be there.”</p><p>“Heh, even now I’m not sure on what I want to do.”</p><p>Everyone else seems to look at each other as if they have been given a cue. Reed bumps Anon with his elbow to grab his attention, and notions Trish to head to the car.</p><p>“Trouble with career ideas, bro? You don’t need to stress on it, man.”</p><p>“We thought about a few ideas.”</p><p>A nudging from behind steals Anon’s attention from Reed. He looks to see Trish holding a-</p><p>Guitar case?!</p><p>Trish doesn’t get the chance to talk before Anon grabs the case and quickly unlocks the hatches. He opens it up to reveal a stunning, brand new red electric guitar. Etched onto it was the VVURM DRAMA logo along with everyone’s names written and faces doodled. This wasn’t just some thrift-shop instrument, it was a brand new design with serious work put into it.</p><p>Anon could only stare as Trish chuckles happily, finally getting to speak.</p><p>“So… we know that you’ve been having some trouble looking for something to do when you get out of high school and all that…”</p><p>Anon digs through the case more to find a VVURM DRAMA hoodie similar to Fang’s top, also made just for him. A look in the compartment shows a heart-shaped pick with “A+F” scratched onto it. It looks to have been made by Fang herself. He continues to examine everything from the case, barely able to contain his racing thoughts. Out of every possible event that could have happened, this probably was the least expected. Trish lets out another chuckle at his reaction.</p><p>“Hehe… and we were thinking of some solutions for you, and after some real careful consideration, we all wanted to ask you…”</p><p>“Anon, would you like to join our band?"</p>
