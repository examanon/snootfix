                    <p>Title: First Time</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang</p><p>Rating: NSFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>Route 4</p><p>Soft guitar chords filled the air as Fang played next to his bed. Leaning back in his chair, Anon listened while thumbing through the different threads available on his favorite South Korean Masked Wrestling Forum. There was something of a rebellion going on against the moderators today, but that was hardly new. Revolutions like this happened constantly, usually led by someone evading some kind of ban. Still, they never seemed to have any success, not that it was surprising. The mods did it for free, after all.</p><p>“Fuck Jannies.” He whispered under his breath, seeing one of the constantly reposted images that was always used in a thread like this. He had to give it to the people who were constantly skirting the line between being a normie and getting an IP-range ban. What they lacked in creativity, they certainly made up for in perseverance. Anon was tempted to add a picture of his own, just to stoke the fires a bit, when he heard the guitar playing stop.</p><p>Wearing an oversized t-shirt that she’d somehow managed to procure and cut a hole in the back of for her wings, Fang looked up at him. “You say something, dweeb?” She asked, cocking her head as she looked over her shoulder. Admittedly, as close as they were, he hadn’t been quite ready to introduce her to the hellhole of his favorite pastime, which was why he was using his phone right now instead of his perfectly good computer right next to him. Desperately searching for something to say, Anon’s eyes zeroed in on the first thing that he could see, namely her colorfully marked and well-used guitar.</p><p>“New song? Haven’t heard this one before.” He said, desperately hoping that his ruse wouldn’t be seen through. As was typical now, his cute Ptero girlfriend rolled her eyes before looking down at her instrument.</p><p>Strumming a new chord, she paused and said, “It’s Black Magic Woman. Seriously? I thought you liked old dad rock songs.” Playing through a few more measures, he could clearly hear the classic Santana rhythm. Since he actually liked this song, he now felt just a little more retarded than usual.</p><p>Suppressing the instinct to dive back into the warm and welcome embrace of calling people slurs online, Anon set his phone aside. Leaning forward, his hands on his legs, he listened as Fang picked up the pace. Ever since she’d put down the bass, her practice on all kinds of different styles was showing results. She was getting better and better, something that bothered him just slightly. If people could actually improve with diligent effort over time, it really opened up new avenues for him. Maybe he could give it a try sometime.</p><p>“Yeah, I mean…” He began, biting his lip. “I just thought you were putting a unique Fang twist on it. Cause it sounds good.” It wasn’t a flawless recovery, but he did see just a hint of a smile on her snoot as she continued to play. It took a few more minutes of near flawless playing, but the Ptero eventually reached the end of the song with a bit of a flourish. Strumming the chords mindlessly after the final note, she set the guitar aside before looking up at him with a distinct look in her amber eyes. </p><p>Rising up, she gestured vaguely towards the bed with a nod of her head. “I’m cold.” She said bluntly, and he had to stop himself from saying something stupid. It took just a moment, but the answer came to him just like it had with her less-than-gentle assistance in music class back at school. He knew how to react to this one! Fang smiled as he jumped to his feet, wrapping her arms and delightfully fluffy wings around his waist as they both dropped down onto the bed. There was no point in pulling up the blanket, since there was more than enough heat just in their embrace to make them both happy. And Anon had to admit, he was very, very happy at that moment. Who knew that the loving embrace of another person could actually be nice?</p><p>Nuzzling her long snoot against his neck, Fang hummed the same song she had been playing a few moments before. “What do you even do on your phone?” She suddenly asked, and Anon froze up as if she’d put icy feet against his back. Which had, in fact, happened more than once in the middle of the night. “I know it’s not texting anyone. You don’t have any friends.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck you.” He growled, and the Ptero laughed at the completely unnecessary and entirely accurate insult. “I’ll have you know that I have plenty of friends. You should know. You’ve known them all longer than me.”</p><p>“So you were texting Naser?” She asked, a smirk on her adorable face. When he shook his head, she immediately replied. “Of course you weren’t. You call him a bro, but you also wouldn’t leave any messages where Naomi can read them. And I know you’re sure as hell not messaging Trish or Reed. You don’t need drugs from the latter and well, the former is pretty obvious. Is it Stella or Rosa?” Grimacing at the thought of being in contact with the one woman who could guess his power level, Anon shook his head again. “Please, Raptor Jesus, don’t tell me you’re messaging Spears?”</p><p>With a sigh, he tried to deflect the uncomfortably personal conversation. “I’m not messaging anyone! Just trolling around on the internet. There’s a lot of stuff in the world that I can’t see looking out my window.” Honestly though, there was a reason he kept his curtains closed as often as possible. No one wanted to look out to see Skin Row. Too much exposure would turn someone into a depressed doomer or something.</p><p>Wrapping one of her legs around his waist, Fang ran her fingers over his chest. As nice as it felt, he was immediately reminded of the complete lack of musculature there. /Fit/ would be able to tear him apart at just a single photo. “C’mon, that’s a shitty answer.” She said, and he had to admit that she was right. Again. As was usual these days. “Were you looking at porn?”</p><p>Threatening to sit up and pull away, Anon saw the potential answers flash before his eyes like he was playing a hentai game or some Ren’Py stuff that amateur devs pumped out on a daily basis. “Oh, it was porn?” Fang exclaimed with a laugh, and he shook his head almost violently. “It’s all good, you’d just have to share. I’ve seen some of the others’ stashes, you know. Reed’s got a whole drive full of weird music video stuff and gay porn. Naomi is completely into dominance. And you didn’t hear this from me and I will absolutely kill you if this gets back to her, but Trish has a human fetish like you wouldn’t believe.”</p><p>Opening his mouth, no words came out and Anon merely laid back down while presented with all this new information. He was somehow completely shocked and entirely unsurprised at the exact same time. The first thought that came into his head was somehow managing to use this against the Triceratops, but he supposed that Fang wouldn’t be in support of it. At least he could mention on his favorite Snoot Drawing Discord that Triggers fucked human men, or something of that nature. That would be fitting.</p><p>“No, it’s not porn.” He said, adding a firmness to his tone that he hoped would end the topic for good. “Besides, I’m not into any of that kind of stuff.” It was as brazen a lie as he had ever told her, dwarfing the time with the concert on an extreme scale. </p><p>Resting her head against his chest, Fang shuffled slightly to better look into his eyes. “What are you into, Anon? Have you got a type? Should I be wearing a shitty maid’s dress right now?”</p><p>Now that was a mental picture that he could have lived without and yet was extremely grateful for. At the same time though, he was at a loss for words. She had seen his old type in full color back on that fateful day in the auditorium, along with the entire Senior body of Volcano High. But his type now? Anon wasn’t entirely sure he even had an answer to that. Biting his lip, he gently touched the feathers of her shoulder, before saying, “You’re my type, Fang.”</p><p>For just an instant, she blushed. The moment was quickly erased as she slapped his chest and said, “You’re such an incredible dweeb. Seriously? ‘You’re my type, Fang.’ That’s the kind of shit that they say in one of those movies my mom watches on loop when my dad’s drunk as hell. Seriously, what do you like?”</p><p>“And if I am being serious?” He said, insisting on the point. Anything to get away from the porn would be best, he figured.</p><p>“Then you’re…” She said, lowering herself back down to look at her hand. The blush returned as she realized that he wasn’t joking or being purposefully cheesy. “Anon, I… Fuck!” The exclamation would have surprised him, but he had an entire half year to get used to the way she thought through things. “If you mean that, really mean that… Does that mean you’ve thought about taking this farther? You know, farther than we’ve gone before.”</p><p>Every single day was probably the most honest answer to that question, but it was hardly the one that he could actually give. Fang was looking at him with a very serious looking in her soft, amber eyes, and he had to stop and consider for a moment how to respond. Ever since that first day, seeing her from the steps, he’d thought that she was attractive. He didn’t even want to go into the mental images he’d had of the girls in lingerie or Fang in a swimsuit. Pursing his lips, he matched his girlfriend’s intense gaze and said, “I mean, of course.” It was honest, and didn’t feel quite as awkward to admit as he had thought. “You’re gorgeous, and you’ve got the cute rocker chick aesthetic down. So you can’t blame me for wanting that, but there’s more to it than that.”</p><p>“Oh? What else is there?” Fang said, her voice even softer now. Anon didn’t believe for a second that she’d never considered it either, but he had kinda opened the door for a bit of insight. Whether he wanted to or not, he was about to show her a bit of what made him tick, even if it came out as a rambled mess.</p><p>“Fang, you… You make me better.” He said, desperately hoping that spaghetti wasn’t spilling everywhere as he spoke. Anon struggled to find the words, and he felt consistently more embarrassed as he continued to speak. Despite it, everything sounded alright, even fitting. “You didn’t force me to be better, and I’m not changing just so I can be with you or anything like that. I’m the absolute worst at explaining feelings and shit, so just bear with me here. But when I’m around you, I just want to be the best I can be. Like you know when you watch one of those big hype sports movies and when it ends you just feel motivated to get up and play a sport you were always complete shit at? And then the next day you remember that it’s actually a stupid idea and you move on with life. It’s like that, but the feeling just… Doesn’t end.”</p><p>Planting her hands on the bed around his chest, Fang leaned up to get a better look at him. “Anon, I…” She began, only to shake her head. With her long, silver hair falling down around her features, she looked like something out of an old style art piece, the kind that get shared online with a meme because one of the background characters was making a funny face.</p><p>“Hold on, let me get through this.” He said, knowing that if he stopped he might not be able to start again. His heart was pounding, the nerves close to shutting him down, but he had to get through it. Gritting his teeth, Anon said, “It’s not just some good or bad morality system in an old rpg. It’s more than that. I genuinely feel like my time with you has changed me. Forced me to grow, to think differently than I ever did before. Fang, I… I’m not perfect, not by any means. But I want to be better because of you. No one has ever had that kind of impact on me. So when I get to be with you, when we’re here cuddling… I guess I do want more. Not just cause ‘lol have sex’ but because you make me happy. Not just in general, but happy with myself. And I want to make you happy as much as possible. And that just so happens to be one of the best ways to do it. Or so I’ve heard.”</p><p>Staring at him, her gaze burning holes into the back of his skull, Anon wondered if he’d gone too far. That was all unbelievably cheesy, something he would have immediately ridiculed on a certain Polynesian Flight Simulator Board, but it was how he felt. For the first time in years, maybe even his entire life, he felt like he had a purpose when he was around her. He felt like he had a future. Taking up the guitar, getting more into engineering, even working out a bit here and there to get rid of his noodle arms, those were all side effects. Fang made him feel alive.</p><p>“You are the biggest dweeb alive.” Fang said, shaking her head. Something about her dry tone caused him to laugh out loud in agreement, but the Ptero touched his chest to quiet him down. “I’m just really, really glad you didn’t start singing Hoobastank’s The Reason right now. That would have been way too much. Anon, I… Thank you for telling me that. You always seemed so confident in who you were. Like you knew what you were doing. Like you didn’t need anyone or anything. But I guess you were a lot more like me than I thought. It just took you saying more than you have literally ever said at once to prove it.”</p><p>This time it was her turn to speak, and Anon kept his mouth wisely shut. “I just wanted to be like you. To have you like me. For the longest time, I guess I saw you as the answer to my questions. But you’re not. You never were.” Ego stinging a bit, he prepared to respond, but she elbowed him softly. Fang wasn’t done yet. “You taught me that. Intentionally or not, leaning heavily towards not right now, I didn’t need to rely on anyone else for an answer. Not Naser, not Trish, no one could solve my problems for me. But you didn’t even try. You were there for me, but you didn’t do it for me. And I am so, so grateful for you.”</p><p>With a shrug, she brought her soft, feathery wings in close around him. “Honestly, I don’t know what the future holds. We’re graduated now. High school is over. We’ve got our lives ahead of us. If we weren’t together… I would be okay, thanks to you. I would make it. I’ve got my music, I’ve got people who care about me, but I don’t lean on them for everything. I can stand on my own two feet, and I’m free to fly.” Fang smiled, her eyes misting over a bit. Anon couldn’t hide the fact that his own were too. “That said… I can’t really see myself anywhere else but here. Right here, Anon, in your arms. You make me so, so happy too. I wouldn’t do this with anyone else, and I wouldn’t even want to. So, I guess what I’m saying is… I want to do a different kind of cuddling with you tonight.”</p><p>Pausing, Anon looked at the Ptero in a sense of disbelief as the mood changed. “Say what now?” He asked, completely unprepared by his extensive experience with roleplaying games for the sudden tonal shift. “Does that mean…”</p><p>“It means I am taking your pants off, yes.” Fang said, looking at him. There was just a hint of something else behind her smugness though, something that he recognized from a few critical moments of their time at Volcano High. She was nervous, afraid even. At first it was a shot to his ego, wondering if she was afraid of what she might find, but as she began to sidle down the bed he realized that that wasn’t quite the case. They had never done this, and as far as he knew, neither of them had done anything like this at all.</p><p>Sexy phrases from confident anime badasses came to mind, as well as one liners by Arnold Schwarzenegger for some reason, but Anon quickly shut those out. Life had taught him that he didn’t have that kind of game, but these past few months had also given him a lesson in being who he really was. “I want that, with you.” He said softly, and Fang smiled. “Take all the time you need, I guess. No rush.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m sure you’d like that.” She said, regaining her confidence. Taking a lingering look at his very obvious erection that had sprung to life under his pants, she gently eased her hands under his belt. It took her a moment, but she finally managed to get it off. With his pants loosened, it took only a bit for her to tug them down, with just a little bit of help. As he moved, Anon noticed her tail wagging at a rapid pace, definitely a sign of excitement. With only his underwear blocking access to his manhood, Fang paused again, just staring at the mound. “You know, I always figured I would be doing this to musical accompaniment.”</p><p>Gesturing to his computer, Anon replied, “I do have some playlists at the ready.” She smirked at him, and he shrugged. “What, you’ve never imagined getting down to Faithfully by Journey?” He demanded, and Fang laughed.</p><p>“I’ll admit, I’ve never imagined that. But now I am. Fine, get your lame playlist up. Let’s see what awful taste you have in boner music.” She said, letting him get up to waddle awkwardly over to the computer. It took only a minute, but soon enough music was pumping through the shitty speakers he had on his desk. Smooth jazz sounded out, just a little bit better than elevator music, and he yanked off his pants before jumping back onto the bed. Reaching out, he snagged his hand around her neck and pulled her into a kiss.</p><p>For what it was worth, the move took her by surprise, and Fang stayed for a good long while pressed against him. Suppressing the urge to boop her snoot, Anon could feel her hand trailing down his chest again. As she hooked her fingers under the hem of his boxers and pulled, he realized that the moment of truth had finally come. He’d figured she had snuck a peak on the times he’d come out of the shower, but this would be the first time she got a full look.</p><p>“Well, fuck.” She said, but the tone of her voice defied the meaning of the words. Slowly wrapping her fingers around the shaft of his cock, she bit her lip. “You’re bigger than I thought. Not huge, but…” Gently stroking her fingers along the sensitive skin, she grinned as he let out a soft sound of satisfaction. “Like that? Just try not to blow up in the first minute or something.”</p><p>Deciding that revenge was certainly on the table, Anon reached down the small of her back, finding her tail an instant later. Fang froze at his touch, before warming up to it and letting him do as he wished while she continued to stare at his standing erection. Continuing even further, he slipped his hand between her thighs, taking a deep breath. “So long, virgins.” He thought to himself before touching her dark panties.</p><p>With a little gasp, Fang looked down. “Not quite there.” She whispered, a hint of nervousness in her voice again. Shit. Cursing the information given to him by hentai artists, he shifted slightly to move his hand forward. This time, the Ptero hissed in pleasure, and he could feel the warmth under the fabric as he rubbed against her slit. For several moments, they just felt each other, exploring each other’s bodies in a moment of mutual affection and indulgence. Maybe it was a little awkward, but Anon didn’t care in the slightest. It felt really good.</p><p>“Okay, I’m gonna try something.” She said, lowering herself down. Realizing what she was about to do, Anon froze again, only for his girlfriend to pause. “But, uh, I don’t want you to stop either. Let me get these off.” Lifting her hips off the bed, she pulled her panties down, completely lacking any sultry grace in the movement. It was a very practical movement, but the efficiency was completely lost on him as he saw, for the very first time, the soft mound of downy feathers where her pubes would have been. As she noticed him staring, she slowly lowered herself back down to the bed. “Well, get back to it.”</p><p>One hand reached out, stroking against her feathers, and he whispered, “Silky.” A moment later, he realized that he had said it out loud, notably as Fang burst out laughing. Burning red, Anon tried to salvage the situation, looking just a little bit further down to where her naked, swollen sex was waiting. With the same kind of soft touch he would use to pet his mini Roomba, he began to stroke her folds, sliding the digit along the length of it.</p><p>“Holy fuck, you’re something else, Anon.” Fang said, wiping away a tear. “I’m glad you were the first to do something laughable and not me though.” Tensing up as his finger rubbed against her clit, she shook her head. “I do love you, you know.”</p><p>Anon knew, and he loved her too. Bending slightly, he kissed her again, even as his hand continued to test out just what he could do between her pale thighs. When she broke away, she brushed her long hair out of her face and grinned. Now it was her turn, and he prepared himself for both the best and the worst at the exact same time.</p><p>Opening her mouth, filled with enough razor-sharp teeth to make a lesser man shrink away, Fang stretched out her tongue to slowly slide along the underside of his cock. Pausing, she seemed to consider the taste, only to nod approvingly and gently wrap her snoot around the crown of his manhood. Sucking softly, if haltingly, she continued to use her tongue where she could. Anon was left completely overwhelmed, the sensations from below wiping out whatever clever catch phrases he would have used. Finally, he let out a single groan of pleasure, blushing as the Ptero smirked in response.</p><p>As the music changed to a new song, one that was more intense than the last, both of them moved a little bit faster to match. As Fang managed to slide down to fit nearly half the shaft into her snoot, Anon deeply regretted not putting a speed metal song in the playlist for moments like this. He wasn’t complaining though, slowly discovering more of what she enjoyed in return. Every time he rubbed her clit, she would tense up, and easing a single finger into her depths was enough to have her purring around his member. It was definitely something to keep in mind.</p><p>Incredible as it was, what Fang had said earlier came back to his head. Trying almost desperately to keep from reaching his peak a little too soon, he let out a long groan. Whether his girlfriend had innate skill or he really was just a complete virgin, he knew he didn’t have long to go. Unwilling to accept that outcome, Anon tapped the Ptero on the shoulder, and she slowly lifted herself back up to look him in the eyes. “I… Raptor Jesus, I need a break. Give me a few minutes, or I’m gonna burst.” He said, and she smirked, entirely too pleased with his admission. Narrowing his eyes, he gestured to her wet, swollen folds. “Let’s see how you like it, huh? Let’s switch places.”</p><p>“Bring it on!” Fang exclaimed, giving his manhood one last lick before shifting in bed. Placing her back against the wall, she spread her legs, giving him a completely shameless view of her lower body. “Show me what you’ve got, Anon.”</p><p>Lowering himself down, he stared at his girlfriend’s slit and froze. It was one thing to touch her, but it was another to come face to face with the forbidden fruit itself. Fang sensed his hesitation and giggled before saying, “It’s not going to bite you, dweeb. As far as I know, I don't have vagina dentata.” Swallowing his nervousness, Anon extended the one finger salute to the Ptero and leaned in, opening his mouth. Breathing quickly, he stuck his tongue out, dragging it along his girlfriend’s naked slit. When she moaned in pleasure, and nothing actually snapped out at him, his confidence soared and he dove in for more.</p><p>With Over and Over by the Smallpools playing in the background, he feasted to the beat. Literally moving with no idea of what he was doing, he tried out every idea he’d ever heard online, some better and some worse. Spelling out his name with his tongue seemed to do alright, but nibbling on her soft thighs didn’t get any reaction. By the time they got to the chorus, he’d figured out a few of the things she enjoyed, and worked the area over with his mouth until he was sore. “I wanna call you mine, and never let you down.” Fang sang along with the chorus, her voice supremely better than anything he could have managed. “I wanna feel it’s right, over and over.”</p><p>“I wanna get inside, and take it up and down.” Having nothing better to do, Anon followed the song, plunging his tongue in between her folds. Rewarded with a pleasant gasp as she lost the song for a moment, he moved even faster. Eager and enthusiastic to please, despite his lack of experience, he did what he could. Soon enough, Fang’s juices were coating his lips and dripping down his chin, and he had no interest in stopping to clean up. “I wanna live this night, over and over.”</p><p>Throughout the song, he explored her body and found what she liked. Just like before, it took time, but he couldn’t really imagine doing it any other way. With Fang, feeling it out was the way to go, and he relished the learning process for every moment that passed. Like she had in music class, the Ptero guided him to what was best, letting out musical sounds of happiness every time he hit just the right note. When her legs were clenching around his head, he knew that he was nailing the solo, and that was good enough for him. Between rubbing her clit and deep, slow licks, he was perfectly happy with the results, and kept going until his jaw was sore.</p><p>Another song went by, and Fang lifted herself up to take a deep breath. “Fuck, that’s good.” She said, before realizing that she had said that out loud too. Smacking him in the shoulder, she growled, “Don’t get used to it though. It’s not that good.” Looking down at his well-soaked manhood and then back into his eyes, she smiled. “I think I’m ready for more, if you are.”</p><p>Barely able to nod and far from actually speaking, Anon watched as the Ptero straddled his hips. With his erection standing tall, she hovered just above it with her fingers on his chest. Taking her time, just as he had said, Fang slowly lowered herself down, letting out a soft sound as the tip of his cock slid against her wet folds. Hesitating, she waited for several long moments, looking to be unsure of herself. </p><p>Reaching out, he tenderly took hold of her hands. Threading his fingers through her own, Anon whispered, “Fang, only if you want this.” The words had slipped out before he’d even realized that he was saying them. A part of him accepted that as an internet shitposter, he probably would be more comfortable cockblocking himself, but this was ridiculous. Taking a moment to compose himself, he added, “I do love you. And I do want this. But I only… Well, I want you to be happy too. I’m not gonna rush you.”</p><p>“Shut up.” She said, surprising him. Kissing him again, she gripped his hands so tightly that the circulation was cut off for a moment. “I want you so badly, damn it. You’re being so… Friggen sweet right now though. You’re supposed to be all awkward and shit. So just shut up, and let me do this.” As if proving it to herself, she lowered herself down again, sliding his cock against her slit once more. Wings furling out behind her, Fang took a deep breath before easing herself even further down. With his cock suddenly pushed inside of her, it was as if explosions were going off in his vision. The pleasure was, well and truly, beyond description.</p><p>Taking nearly the rest of the current song to recover from that first descent, the both of them were quickly spewing out expletives and moans. Gently sliding up and down his manhood, her hands gripping his own, Fang didn’t go fast at all. Admittedly, she didn’t need to. The situation was incredible as it was, and all too quickly he realized that he was getting closer to the edge. Grunting, he tried to get her attention. Sounding like a neanderthal, Anon failed to get the words out, but somehow she seemed to get the gist of it.</p><p>“I know.” She whispered, her voice strained. “Me too. I want it all inside.” Like a starting gun going off, that last word was enough to send him over the edge. Anon groaned loudly as he came, feeling her walls clenching around his cock as she climaxed as well. Painting her depths in white, he had the best orgasm of his life, by far. It was over in moments, but it had felt like an eternity to him. For the while that his pleasure peaked, Anon was in heaven, his angelic girlfriend right there with him. In the clouds, he embraced her with everything that he had, feeling his love and affection reaching a new intensity he had never even imagined.</p><p>Breathing hard, the two of them simply tried to catch their breath. Slumped against his chest, with her feathery wings wrapped around him like a blanket, Fang had tears in her eyes. These weren’t tears of sadness though, something that he recognized well enough. When the both of them were physically capable of doing so, she kissed him again and again. Her tears mixed with his own, though he would never admit it to anyone, and for a long time they were as close as possible. Closer even, practically becoming one, he thought.</p><p>“Was that a stupid choice?” She whispered, and he realized what she meant. Even now, he could feel the warmth of his cum dripping around his cock and out of her folds. “Did Biology class even go over that kind of shit?”</p><p>“Does Volcano High even have a Biology teacher?” He asked, completely unable to remember the answer. “But whatever happens…” Pausing, Anon looked up at his cutie 3.14 Ptero girlfriend. “I’m glad I did it with you, Fang. There’s no one else I would rather be with, not in all the whole fucking world.”</p><p>Wrapping her arms around him in the warmest embrace of his life, Anon could hear Fang’s soft breathing as she whispered words of love in return. Whatever happened next, they were together, and that was all that he needed. His eyes drifted over to his phone, wondering how he would mention this to his favorite Peruvian Matte Drinking Chatroom. Maybe something about how they were all going to make it, or how Ptero GF’s were best.</p><p>Turning his gaze to his lover, Anon smiled. For the first time in years, he felt no need to head to the internet right now. He had everything that he wanted, everything that he needed, in his arms. That was good enough for him.</p><p>*****</p><p>Years later, sprawled atop the roof of Volcano High, Anon tried to catch his breath once more. For all the more ‘adult’ changes Lucy had made to her life, she still had a bit of a wilder side. Fucking on the roof of her workplace certainly played a big part of that. This spot, where they had first truly come to know each other, had become the favorite for his late night visits. He wondered how she explained her constant late nights to her boss, if she explained them at all.</p><p>Looking down at his beloved wife, wearing a nice big wedding ring as well as the amber pendant he had given her all those years before and little else, he grinned. “What are you looking at, dweeb?” She asked, her breasts rising and falling quickly as she recovered from her latest orgasm. With experience had come skill and endurance, and they’d both managed to last significantly longer than their first time together. “I hope you didn’t get any cum on my skin again. The principal saw the stains the other night.”</p><p>Rolling his eyes, he wondered what the younger Fang would have said about that. He doubted that she would have given two fucks about who saw the results of their lovemaking. Finally, he kissed her again and said, “I’m looking at the most beautiful woman in the entire world and the love of my life.”</p><p>Blushing once more, a sight that he never got tired of, Lucy gripped his hand tightly. “Still gotta be sweet like that, huh?” She asked, no hint of displeasure in her worn out voice.</p><p>“Yeah, guess I do.” He said with a laugh, kissing her again. “Never saw any reason to stop.” That much was certainly true. Even five years apart had never dampened the feelings he’d felt for her, and on his return she’d shown that she felt the exact same. Even today, it still amused him to think about the days at college. Joining with a frat while he studied, the more confident Anon had been approached constantly by his brothers and interested girls, but he’d never even considered the possibility. Though they were on a break, his heart had been back here with Lucy, and he’d never even gone on a date. They’d texted constantly, sending memes of increasingly complex inside jokes back to each other to the point that they were practically speaking their own language.</p><p>Was it unsurprising to find out that she’d done the exact same thing? She’d had options, certainly. Cops that knew her dad, single faculty members at the school, even the occasional student had all made a pass, but she’d turned them all down. Even though the miles separated them, they had remained as close as they could manage. Lucy had never taken her Christmas gift off, always wearing it as a reminder of him.</p><p>Rubbing her fingers along the amber pendant that matched her eyes so well, Lucy grinned up at him. “You know, I didn’t just ask you here for a quick lay. Principal is looking for parent volunteers to chaperone at the school dance. No one is actually volunteering, so I figured I would ask you. Up to relive some old memories?”</p><p>Biting the inside of his cheek, Anon was interested in turning her down immediately. Even if his wife had grown to enjoy working with the kids here, he wasn’t exactly keen on watching a bunch of horny teens grope each other on the dance floor. “Three questions affect the answer that I will give.” He said, holding up three fingers. “One, will I be required to dance? Cause these guilty feet have got no rhythm. Two, will you be performing? And three, will you be wearing that sexy as hell purple dress from our prom?”</p><p>Sliding the brown sweatshirt down over her breasts as she sat up, Lucy grinned. “There was no call to quote George Michael to me, Anon.” She said, and he shrugged. “No, you will not be required to dance. You just need to stand at the side of the room and wag your finger sternly at kids if they try to make out on the dance floor. I won’t be performing, as fun as it sounds. A preselected playlist will be used for the most part, with a small performance by a garage band of students. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?” Chuckling, she leaned in to give him a little kiss on the cheek. “And if you say yes to this, I’ll wear the purple dress to the dance. And afterwards too, if you behave.”</p><p>With answers like that, Anon didn’t have the slightest reason to say no. Grudgingly nodding his head, he couldn’t help but smile as his Ptero wife hugged him warmly. “Will you actually be wearing underwear this time?” He asked, his voice muffled by her embrace.</p><p>“During the dance? Absolutely, school policy. But afterwards?” She pressed her snoot to his ear, whispering some particularly lewd promises about what he could expect after the dance was done. Eyebrows raised, he was more than happy to accept that response. As she finished with another kiss, he turned to kiss her back with a big smile on his face.</p><p>Wrapping his arm around the woman’s waist, he followed her gaze as she looked out to see the last light of the sun fading over the horizon. Life had been a wild ride, and it didn’t look to be slowing down any time soon. In all honesty though, he wouldn’t have it any other way. Anon had meant it years ago when he’d talked with Fang, and he believed it even more now with Lucy hand in hand. He was a better person now, with a purpose that no one could ever take away from him.</p><p>When he’d first come to Volcano High, he’d been expecting the worst half year of his life. A fucking dinosaur school filled with every color of the rainbow? A part of him would have rather died. But Anon had come to realize that within these walls he’d found something far greater than he ever could have imagined. With Lucy by his side, he’d found true and lasting happiness. And despite the challenges that had come and would continue to come, maybe that was enough.</p><p>They were all going to make it.</p><p>Fin</p>
