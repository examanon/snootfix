He's a special kind of retard, but he means well in every sense. He's got a weird thing against humans though..."</p><p>>You roll your eyes, knowing full well of Naser's weird human racism. He seems to like you though, at least. No sense on pondering it.</p><p>>Everything's going along, you play games, listen to some metal, etcetera, etcetera.</p><p>>You look over at Olivia in her wheel chair, scooching around uncomfortably.</p><p>>Maybe she needs to pee or something?</p><p>>Her dad wasn't here either. Oh shit.</p><p>>"Uhm...sorry Anon. I-it's just. It's bath night...and I usually have one by now, but... dad's gone for the time being and I dunno what to do."</p><p>>You think out your choices...</p><p>>You could gulp help her, probably... or.</p><p>>You could just leave, give an excuse... to say bye...</p><p>>but...</p><p>>That's such a horrible thing to do. Not even you would do that, what the fuck were you thinking?</p><p>>If you needed help, you'd hope somebody, anybody would help you.</p><p>>With rising heat in your face and your ears, you stammer out...</p><p>>"I mean...if you n-need help or somethin...I could help you if..you know. You uh...want...me to?"</p><p>>Olivia stares at you, her face unreadable. The sheer unemotion makes you feel nervous.</p><p>>Her face cracks, a 'pfft' and a giggle later, she's holding her stomach.</p><p>>Damn, now you feel dumb for asking. Was that not normal to ask?</p><p>>"Gosh, Anon. didn't expect you to want to bathe the crippled girl so much, heheh."</p><p>>You hold out your arms in defense of yourself.</p><p>>"WHAT?! N-NO LIKE, I WAS JUST SAYING, Y'KNOW?"</p><p>>You can't help your volume control, your spaghetti dropped and now it's code red all over in your mind.</p><p>>"Re-laaaax~ I'm just messing with you, peach-fuzz."</p><p>>"Peach...fuzz?"</p><p>>Olivia giggles at you repeating her weird new pet name for you.</p><p>>"You know...because you're kind of the color of a peach in a way, and peaches tend to be a little fuzzy, kind of like how your face is a bit fuzzy. It's cute."</p><p>>You could've sworn you were completely bald from genetics, but peach fuzz? Maybe Raptor Jesus didn't hate you.</p><p>>"My offer still stands though, Olivia. I don't mind helping you whatsoever. After all you're my friend, right?"</p><p>>Olivia's playful mood falters a small bit, her smile tacked on unlike before.</p><p>>"Come on, you don't need to do that, I can wait, dude. Besides... I ain't much to...look at."</p><p>>Anon sidles up besides Olivia and gets her to look him in the eyes.</p><p>>"That's so not true, and you know it! You're really pretty, Olivia. Don't think otherwise. I get it, being... unable to walk sucks, but you're a trooper! Look, I've helped my grandma shower before, it's the exact same thing, right? How bad could it be?"</p><p>>Olivia looks taken aback a bit, but smiles smugly.</p><p>>"If you insist, big guy..."</p><p>>Man you really need to shut the fuck up sometimes...</p><p>>right now you're helping Olivia undress and get ready to shower.</p><p>>While at first she was smug, by the time her hoodie came off, then her shirt, then her jeans, and just being in her underwear, her tone changed drastically.</p><p>>You go to help her unfasten her bra, but before you can, you realize it doesn't have a harness in the back.</p><p>>"Uuuhhhh, Olivia... Where's the bra thing at? To unhook it?"</p><p>>"Oh! Sorry, 'non. I got it. It's in the front, just gimme a sec."</p><p>>You see her arms fiddle near the front of her chest, and before long, you see her bra loosen and fall from her shoulders.</p><p>>You gasp out a shy "Oh!" and look away, hoping to keep her from feeling too embarrassed.</p><p>>There was a pause, until then she opens up.</p><p>>"Uhm... I need help with my underwear."</p><p>>It takes you a second before you realize what she's implying.</p><p>>You mentally prepare yourself with helping your friend.</p><p>>You walk up to her front and smile, hoping to ease the tension.</p><p>>Her embarrassment is palpable even from here.</p><p>>You begin tugging near her thighs.</p><p>>"alright, up."</p><p>>Doing so, you get them to slide off as she goes to use her free hand to cover up her privates.</p><p>>You almost let out a groan in sympathy, getting second-hand feelings of shyness from this.</p><p>>"Hey... sorry this is weird. But at least you get to shower, right?"</p><p>>She smiles a little and chuckles.</p><p>>"Y-yeah...heh, guess you're r-right."</p><p>>Once done you align her to the bath, and notice there's a shower chair.</p><p>>"Oh sweet, your dad got you one of those chairs, huh? That's really nice of him!"</p><p>>"Yea, he's an amazing guy. I love him a lot."</p><p>>Your heart melts at that, knowing he really is a cool guy.</p><p>>You place a hand onto her shoulder to let her know the next step is coming.</p><p>>For this you look away so as not to look at her naked form out of respect.</p><p>>you hear a tired sigh and look back into Olivia's eyes wondering what might be wrong.</p><p>>"You need to look at me when we do this, dumbass. I don't wanna fall and make your task harder than it already is. So just look at me, I don't care if you see my fat tits, dude."</p><p>>You get a genuine laugh out of that</p><p>>"Alright, alright! sorry, okay? Alright, now just put your hands on my shoulders, okay? I'll help you up."</p><p>>You begin wrapping your arms around her upper body, realizing she's nowhere near as chubby as you initially though. Once you've got a good hold on her, you tell her.</p><p>>"Alright on the count of three, I'll pick you up just enough to get on the chair, alright? Here we go."</p><p>>Getting no more than a small "mmh-hmm" from her, you count down.</p><p>>One</p><p>>Two</p><p>>Three!</p><p>>Lifting her up, you step one foot into the shower and help her shimmy onto the chair, placing her legs into the tub itself.</p><p>>With that done, she goes back to covering herself up and she smiles to you.</p><p>>"Uh...thanks, man. You really didn't have to do this for me."</p><p>>You roll your eyes and sigh with a smile.</p><p>>"Shush. We got this far, I'll be damned to not help you all the way through, okay?"</p><p>>You playfully rustle her hair in which she leans into it and giggles.</p><p>>Time for the actual shower part.</p><p>>Now... how are you going to shower her without getting your clothes wet...?</p><p>>May as well go with the flow.</p><p>>You begin stripping your top.</p><p>>Olivia looks over and stammers.</p><p>>"What're you doing, man?!"</p><p>>You shrug and tell her innocently,</p><p>>"I don't wanna get my shirt wet, so I'll just take it off and help you bathe. Why, does your dad not help with the bathing part?"</p><p>>You feel like you might've overstepped a boundary here.</p><p>>"H-he does help with parts I c-can't reach, but I can just...skip that stuff for now..."</p><p>>-</p><p>>"No! You are not skipping parts of your body, Olivia. That's how you get rashes and other nasty stuff! I'll let you wash the parts you can wash, and if you REALLY need help, I don't mind helping you one bit, alright? I'm here to help you."</p><p>>Olivia doesn't respond to that, and just quietly asks me to turn on the water. You nod and notice it has a temperature reading on it.</p><p>>"Oh damn, does this heat up the water before spraying it out? Neat"</p><p>>Noticing her calming down when you make small talk, you make sure to do this more often to keep her from shutting down to stuff around her.</p><p>>The whole time you turn on the water, you laugh when getting soaked by the shower, you help her wash her back, her hair, and when it came to it, you helped her down there when she asked and only if she asked.</p><p>>Once everything was done, you finally managed to get her dried, clothed and back into her wheelchair in a timely fashion. You even got some praise out of her for it.</p><p>>"Damn, that's a record right there. Usually takes my pops a good hour and a half to do that. You did that in about half an hour. Nice job. Might just need to hire you!"</p><p>>You laugh at her gracious thanks and shrug off the praise.</p><p>>"hehe, hey. What are friends for, huh?"</p><p>>It goes quiet for a good bit with you and her just smiling at each other.</p><p>>That's when her facade falls. It started slowly.</p><p>>You could tell from her eyes.</p><p>>Tears started to fall, a sniffle, then she put her head into her hands and bawled.</p><p>>With the two of you sitting on her bed, you were able to comfort her, letting her fall into your chest, hugging her as tightly as you could.</p><p>>There was no need for you to cry, in fact you felt the opposite reaction.</p><p>>You just sat there and combed your hand through her hair and supported her back with your free hand, rocking her back and forth.</p><p>>"Sssshhh, ssshhh sshhh-hey what's the matter? It's okay, it doesn' bother me one bit, alright?"</p><p>>After some more hiccups and tears, you finally hear her try talking to you.</p><p>>"I...I-I'm so phugin' useless! I ha-hate being like thi-hi-his!"</p><p>>Now it was time to start feeling that stinging in the back of your nose, that welling up of water in your eyes...</p><p>>"Olivia! Please! It's okay! I would NEVER think any different of you! Don't think of yourself like that. You're such a good person, o-okay?!"</p><p>>You started burying your face into her freshly washed hair. So soft and nice, you kept rocking each other back and forth, neither of you wanting to let go.</p><p>>"You're a good girl... Your dad loves you so much, your friends love you... I love you too."</p><p>>She sniffs, her crying dying down a little. You started rubbing her shoulder to let her know you're here for her.</p><p>>You smile again for the time you've lost count to, thinking of something that'd hopefully brighten her up.</p><p>>"You know who else loves you?"</p><p>>...</p><p>>"Wh....who?"</p><p>>You tilt her head up with a nudge to look in the direction of her rat, Guts.</p><p>>During this whole thing you almost forgot his existence, but thankfully he existed at the best times when he's needed.</p><p>>Just seeing Guts in his cage set Olivia off again on another tirade of crying, burying herself deeper into your chest so much to the point you fall onto her bed with her in tow</p><p>>She starts mumbling apologies one after the other so quickly it's almost impossible to keep up.</p><p>>Seeing Olivia so emotional really does something to you. Someone usually so laid back just letting out this much sadness is jarring.</p><p>>But you persist, you need to be her rock right now, and by Raptor Jesus you're gonna be it.</p><p>>What felt like a good hour passes by the two of you, Olivia just laying halfway on your chest, fiddling with your shirt, the occasional sniffle coming from her.</p><p>>"Did you mean what you said, Anon."</p><p>>You look down at Olivia who trying to look you in the eyes, but doesn't seem to muck up the courage to do it completely.</p><p>>"Did I mean what?"</p><p>>"Y...you know. That...you loved me?"</p><p>>"Well, yea of course I love you, Olivia! You're a great girl."</p><p>>Olivia sighs in a frustrated tone, seemingly not getting the answer she wanted.</p><p>>"I want you to do something, okay?"</p><p>>You shrug, "Okay, what would that be?"</p><p>>"Kiss me."</p><p>>Your eyes almost bulge out of their sockets with that request.</p><p>>"B-but Olivia...I'm with Fang! That's not something I can do..."</p><p>>While going through this conversation, you both sit upright again and you notice the sun's gotten a bit closer towards the horizon. Must be around five or six by now.</p><p>>You look down at the miserable baryonyx leaning on you, trails of dried tears all over her green cheeks.</p><p>>"I know! I know...but...you're the only guy's who's seen me like this besides my dad...I just thought that maybe...could you at least give me something in return?"</p><p>>You pause yourself there for a moment, thinking hard about this. You love and appreciate Olivia a lot, like a sibling even, but what she's asking is dangerous...</p><p>>You can feel her scaly hand brush up and lay itself down on yours and you look her in the eyes again.</p><p>>You should really stop looking into her eyes...it's going make you make bad choices...</p><p>>"...Alright...but just this once, okay?"</p><p>>Olivia looks down contemplating what's about to happen.</p><p>>You're also contemplating what's about to happen.</p><p>>"You promise I get to?"</p><p>>You roll your eyes and try to smile through the situation.</p><p>>"Well, duh. C'mere. You do at least get to have this, I guess."</p><p>>Before closing your eyes and puckering your lips, you could see Olivia's tail thumping repeatedly on her bed. Looks like somebody was excited.</p><p>>You guided your hands to Olivia's head, holding it by the sides and caressing her scaled cheeks. The thumping got louder.</p><p>>Bringing your lips together, you make sure to let it last enough to be enjoyable, but not long enough to turn into something more, lest you go over the point of no return with Olivia.</p><p>>During the kiss, the thumping reached maximum speed, and slowed back down as you parted from the smooch with her snoot.</p><p>>Her eyes fluttered open and looked right into yours. The redness on her face never once leaving as she smiled at you.</p><p>>She gave you a near back-breaking hug, wrapping your arms around her as well.</p><p>>"Thanks, peach fuzz. That...that was nice."</p><p>>You smile at her again, running your hand through her short green hair.</p><p>>"Glad you enjoyed it. Uh...sorry this can't, you know...be anything more, Olivia."</p><p>>She deflates a little, but rebounds just as quickly, though you can tell her smile seems a bit more forced than usual.</p><p>>"Nah I get it, Anon. It'd be wrong of me to...get inbetween what you and Fang have, man, but...can I ask you something?"</p><p>>"Mmmh? Sure, what is it?"</p><p>>She looks down from you, the thumping having completely ceased by now.</p><p>>"If...i-if it doesn't ever...work out between you and uh, Fang. I'd be by your side if you wanted...me..."</p><p>>You fell silent at this, your arm still wrapped around your friend. Could you really stay this way with this kind of tension between each other?</p><p>>"That's quite the proposal, Olivia. Heheh...uh... I'll genuinely keep that in mind, but you need to promise me something, okay Olivia?"</p><p>>She looks up to you, completely bewitched by you at this point. She leaned into you as you looked at her.</p><p>>"Don't wait for me, okay? If you ever find someone out there for you, go for it."</p><p>>Her smile never ceased, her having relaxed right into you.</p><p>>"On one condition, then."</p><p>>Oh boy, this wouldn't bode well for you, but you'll bite.</p><p>>"What's the condition, Olivia?"</p><p>>"Gimme just one more kiss and we'll call it even."</p><p>>You shake your head in disbelief and chuckle softly. You expected something much more than that, but you guess she deserved it after having literally let you bathe her.</p><p>>"Fine, but only one more time, okay? We can't be doing this...much."</p><p>>The last part sent her tail thumping against the bed again, albeit a bit quieter.</p><p>>"Deal. Now, c'mere."</p><p>>Maybe this wouldn't be so bad...you just hoped to Rapter Christ this won't spiral out of control.</p><p>>Hopefully.</p><p>>The last thing to wander your mind before getting assaulted by the baryonyx was just how far this was going to go.</p><p>>She needed it, so it wasn't nearly as bad as if this was under normal circumstances...or at least that's how it felt, hopefully nobody would judge you for this if anyone found out...</p><p>>The End...</p><p>>For Now...</p></div>
