Every time we would see each other, at a liquor store or in a run-down bar or at dealer’s house, you made it clear to me that you hated me. You hadn’t seen your parents or your friends or your brother since high school, and you hated me for that. You hated me for those things I said at the beach all those years ago, probably still hate me for those words.

Reverently, he lays them on the hard stone, set in a forgotten corner of the destitute cemetery, his hands shaking slightly as the brush the name inscribed upon it. Withdrawing his hands back into his pockets, Anon takes one final look at the name chiseled on the small slab before turning away.</p><p>Here lies Lucy</p><p>2001-2025</p>
