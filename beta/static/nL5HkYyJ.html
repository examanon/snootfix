Something to surprise her with whenever I get back from this hell.</p><p>It was the night before a patrol, and I was strangling the life out of my guitar trying to make something resembling music come out of it.</p><p>Anon</p><p>Piece of shit.</p><p>Dying cats make sound better than this.</p><p>Those guides on the communist melon farming bulletin only seem to be taking me so far.</p><p>I wish I had a teacher here.</p><p>Lucy...</p><p>Skip</p><p>KEEP IT THE FUCK DOWN</p><p>From the darkness, I hear something cut through the still night air.  A major league beer-can coming right for the back of my head.</p><p>This time, it only grazes the side of my head.</p><p>Least I learned something in the service.</p><p>Got a problem? Twink?</p><p>Skip might be more jacked then me, but he's a manlet. He'll never learn. Throws a mean fucking fastball though, he played division one highschool ball you know? Was scouted, but got fucked for a drug violation.</p><p>You know how fucking late it is to be making that racket?</p><p>And I'm on watch tonight, and more than far enough away you can just use your earplug.</p><p>Not good enough fucker, get an electric or something. I don't need to be subject to this shit before a patrol</p><p>Bags under his eyes, looks like he's not exaggerating.</p><p>Take mine, don't need em anyways.</p><p>He takes them, but looks me up and down again. Guess he needs to chew me out some more. For his “ego”</p><p>Skip    </p><p>Still pining over your girl back home?</p><p>Never should have told him about her.</p><p>Anon </p><p>Lay off, faggot.</p><p>What, she know your out here so Exxon or whoever the fuck can dig up the remains of her grandparents?</p><p>Gruff</p><p>You talking shit about me again Skinnie?</p><p>The twig of a soldier yawns as he approaches the fire, his ebony skin would have kept him hidden in the dark had the scales on his elbows not given him away.</p><p>Can it halfbreed.</p><p>Which part of me are you referring to there, my race or my species?</p><p>Both.</p><p>Alright, though for a white boy you look far more Italian if you catch my drift.</p><p>The fuck does that even mean.</p><p>You tell me, smoothskin.</p><p>From his tone, I can tell he is genuinely confused how that insult didn't land.</p><p>This guy might be half my size, but I know better than to fuck with him.</p><p>I didn't need CQC to tell me not to fuck with a dino, even a half dino, but some fuckers like Skip needed that experience hands on.</p><p>Why you even pining after this girl if she's back home? She'll have long ago since left your sorry ass.</p><p>I peg the full can of beer between his eyes.</p><p>Out of all the options he could chose, he chose to headbutt it.</p><p>Not the correct answer, made obvious from the way his head spun as it crunched against his forehead.</p><p>Raptor fucking Christ Anon.</p><p>Gruff laughs, and takes a bite out of a Bug protein bar</p><p>I still can't believe you eat those things</p><p>Gruff </p><p>Don't knock it till you try it. want a bite?</p><p>Last time I ate a type B ration I threw up for an hour straight.</p><p>You're a bit over-dramatic there, but suit yourself.</p><p>He shoves the entire bar into his maw. His face looks human enough until he opens his mouth and it looks like the fucking predator</p><p>So why you even bring that thing if you can't even play?</p><p>Because</p><p>Skip holds the cold beer can to his head, covering up the third eye I opened up on him</p><p>His girlie back home taught him how to play,        </p><p>And? Sounds to me like your just jealous. He ain't being that loud. I didn't wakeup till I heard you scream.</p><p>A DINO girlie Skip</p><p>Wait, he's got a Dino girl? Anon?</p><p>I nod at him.</p><p>Fuck. Still, kinda shocked he got anyone with the way he hangs up all those cartoon girl stickers.</p><p>It's called anime.</p><p>You think I give a shit?</p><p>Don't knock it till you try it.</p><p>Figured you just had a fetish though when the sergeant chewed you out after finding that pterodactyl pocket pussy.</p><p>Onahole</p><p>Ona-what</p><p>Onahole, fuck those imitation American sex toys.</p><p>Raptor Christ Anon.</p><p>Anyways...</p><p>Skip opens the beer can, feeling like he's done a good enough job of keeping his wound covered.</p><p>I need some shut eye, keep it down alright. I get you miss your girlie but you got to focus on what's in front of you.</p><p>He disappears into the darkness, the last thing being visible in the dark being his middle finger.</p><p>Cunt.</p><p>Gruff takes a seat next to me by the fire.</p><p>Let me help you out a bit, I played back home you know. Learn a new song, suprise your girl when you get back home.</p><p>He takes a look at my guitar, and his eyes widen.</p><p>These strings... let me see if I got anything.</p><p>For the first night in a long time, I managed to make music come out of this thing.</p><p>I wish you could hear it Lucy.</p><p>...</p><p>The next day, on patrol, our driver ran over an IED.</p><p>I had the devil's luck, just some bruises, same with Skip.</p><p>Gruff, on the other hand, lost his right leg.</p><p>Earned himself a medical discharge.</p><p>Lucky bastard.</p><p>For a second night, I was able to play something resembling music.</p></div>
