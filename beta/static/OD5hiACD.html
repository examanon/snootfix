You're a great guy."</p><p>>...</p><p>>Thanks?</p><p>>Anon is basically the go-to excuse for a lot of his friends to say,</p><p>>"I'm not specist! How can I be specist when I'm friends with Anon? He's a human!"</p><p>>"I mean, I don't blame you man."</p><p>>"If you saw where I live, you'd be pretty disappointed."</p><p>>"Anon, don't tell me you live...in Skinrow?"</p><p>>Dialogue_choice.png</p><p>>"Sorry if I sound like I'm prying, but"</p><p>>"What makes me so different from the rest of 'em?"</p><p>>"Hmmm... I think it's the way you're so adaptable."</p><p>>"Naser... What the fuck does that even mean?"</p><p>>"You're human and all, but you act like your own self. You don't get into any kind of mob-mentality."</p><p>>"The fact that I can talk to anybody is a miracle, Naser."</p><p>>As Naser lets out a chuckle at Anon's expense, the song ends and switches to the next in the playlist.</p><p>>MoonPtero- Right Wing Death Squads</p><p>>???</p><p>>"LOOK I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY, OKAY, ANON?"</p><p>>"No, no, I know."</p><p>>"I actually find it kind of catchy, believe it or not."</p><p>>"Turn that shit up."</p><p>>Anon takes a glance at the MoonPtero playlist on the car's dashboard</p><p>>Right Wing Death Squads</p><p>>Notorious PPP</p><p>>Fresh Ptero</p><p>>Pterotopia</p><p>>Shootouts</p><p>>49 Faggots and One Dune Skinnie</p><p>>Triggerland</p><p>>Crank Dat</p><p>>Triceratops Lives Don't Matter</p><p>>In Da Party</p><p>>Enter the Triple P Mafia</p><p>>Shooting For Diversity</p><p>>Dear lord, is Naser okay?</p><p>>Maybe Naser and I have more in common than we thought.</p><p>>It seems we're both off-the-charts autistic.</p><p>>"Hey, Naser"</p><p>>What the hell is 'Human History Month' anyway?"</p><p>>"I've literally never heard of it"</p><p>>"It's some dumb shit a bunch of skins wanted to do for," Naser raises his voice's pitch and makes it nasally for this as a mocking expression "rEpReSeNtAtIoN!!!"</p><p>>"Is that why Fang tried handing me a stick?"</p><p>>"She just came up to me, all embarrassed"</p><p>>"And handed me a stick just expecting me to say something about it"</p><p>>"Is that, like"</p><p>>"Part of the whole thing or what?"</p><p>>"Anon. I'm actually surprised you didn't know about the whole "Human History Month" stuff."</p><p>>Anon deadpans at this</p><p>>"Dude, I've kinda lived around both communities my entire life. I'm guessing the human month shit is new?"</p><p>>"Kinda, yea. Although seeing how it's gone, looks like humanity's pretty damn divided inside itself any how."</p><p>>Naser chuckles a bit glumly, but sees Anon's face drop down a smidge.</p><p>>Yea...might've hit a raw spot with that.</p><p>>Good job, you just made your human depressed about his entire species' existence.</p><p>>"I know what you mean, Naser. It fucking sucks."</p><p>>Naser perks up a bit from this.</p><p>>"Huh? What d'you mean, bro?"</p><p>>Anon looks forward to the ever moving road. His gaze never changing. It reminded Naser of a movie with a human in it that always looked depressed.</p><p>>"We've always been at each others' throats when you look at it. It's no wonder your people were able to just...get everything together."</p><p>>Naser doesn't look over to him, instead opting to just watch the road.</p><p>>"Yea... I guess I see what you mean...</p><p>>The rest of the car ride is spent in silence, a silence that comforts, but also makes the both of them feel anxious...</p><p>>...Until Anon interjects once more</p><p>>"Naser...?"</p><p>>"Do you... really hate humans that much? Like, all of them?"</p><p>>"Uh..."</p><p>>(sigh)</p><p>>Naser crosses his fingers in anxiety, not entirely sure on what to say</p><p>>Anon continues to deadpan his friend, not realizing he's making it worse</p><p>>"I mean..."</p><p>>"How do I-"</p><p>>(SIGH)</p><p>>"Look, I'm not asking you to just... say you love them all unconditionally and shit, man."</p><p>>Anon looks away, rubbing one of his arms nervously.</p><p>>"It's weird, usually this kind of shit doesn't bother me one bit, but sometimes, not even from you, but I feel like people see me as something that's not... worth it."</p><p>>Naser slows to car down and pulls to the side.</p><p>>He slumps down, hitting his head on the steering wheel a tiny bit on the way down. A deep breath in, and one out as he calms his headache.</p><p>>"Anon! I don't... I don't hate you, okay? You're an amazing bro, I'd even... go as far as to think of you as a brother, man..."</p><p>>Anon notices Naser's voice crack a bit at the mention of considering him a brother.</p><p>>His glare softens seeing Naser open up this way with him.</p><p>>He smiles at Naser.</p><p>>"I love you, bro. I'd call you a brother too."</p><p>>Naser looks at Anon, completely silent.</p><p>>Even after all of the questionable shit, Anon thinks of him as a brother.</p><p>>"God dammit."</p><p>>Anon pulls Naser into a side hug, patting his head.</p><p>>Anon chuckles a bit at Naser's breakdown.</p><p>>"You're a big baby sometimes, you know? Don't change, man."</p><p>>They both laugh after a bit of a tearful moment. Calming down, they both get back onto the road, listening to tunes all the way.</p></div>
