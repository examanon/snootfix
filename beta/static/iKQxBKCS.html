                    <p>Title: Bros Nap</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Naser, Ripley, Reed</p><p>Rating: NSFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>      Bro Nap’s </p><p>      Anon couldn’t believe he was going to Fang’s house tonight for something other than hanging out with Fang. He had mixed signals about that house. It contained the love of his life and potentially the end of his life, at the end of a golf club. At least he wouldn’t be alone, because this was a sleepover! Childish sounding as it may be. It was also necessary. Recently a human gang war had broken out on skin row and Anon doubted the safety of his crappy apartment.</p><p>      With him walked the pink smokestack known commonly as Reed. Apparently, his place had burned down due to no fault of his own, which Anon had serious doubts on. Both refuges carried only the essentials. Sleeping bags, PJs, and dental care. Though Anon suspected Reed had something extra in his backpack. A bold move considering Naser’s dad resided at their destination. Hopefully they would not all die from Reed’s mistakes.</p><p> </p><p>      Ten minutes later and the two were walking up to the front porch. Anon was going to let Reed knock but realized he had made an error as Reed just swayed in one spot, seemingly in another world. So, he stepped up and took the risk, tapping away on the door. A low groan emanated from a dazed Reed, causing Anon to look back as he continued to absent mindlessly knock. Right after he did the door opened and Anon failed to stop himself in time as his hand knocked onto a snoot. The one that belonged to Fang’s dad. </p><p>      Looking back with a face of pants shitting fear. Anon quickly retreated from the Angry Father. Fang’s old man raised an accusatory finger at the boys. “If it wasn’t for my boy’s generosity I….” He was interrupted by his less murderous wife slipping in front of him. “Oh my! What fine young gentlemen, so kind of my Naser to invite you over this evening! Come in come in, I’ve made snacks.” With that she turned and dragged her husband inside with her. </p><p>      Reed shrugged at the momentarily petrified Anon and went inside. Anon hesitantly following. There Anon saw Naser, Fang’s mom, and Dad sitting in the living room. With Reed already moving to take a load off. Still feeling the need for self-preservation Anon sat in the chair with the most distance from Naser’s Dad. Surprisingly Fang was not present. Anon made to quietly ask Naser, who was sitting nearby, but Naser knew that question was coming and whispered “Girl problems” And that was the end of that inquiry.</p><p>      “Okay boys it’s already late so have your snacks, head up to Naser’s room, and set up your shit there. And I’m a light sleeper so no funny business!” Said Naser’s Dad, scanning the three for any signs of weakness. He seemed satisfied enough with the fearful looks he got. At least he thought that Reed was giving off that look, hard to tell. That boy wasn’t right. He then got up and left the group to go polish his golf club collection. While Fang’s mom said her good nights and went off to find a quit place to read.</p><p>      This left the boys on their own as they finished the cookies Fang’s mom had left out. “So, bro’s I got this sweat new shit I’ve been meaning to…” Reed started, reaching towards his bag. “Reed for the love of Raptor Jesus please.” Naser implored. Anon went pale and started muttering things. Reed pulled his hands up and smiled. “Just messing with ya bros. It’s my Xrox in there.” </p><p>      “Reed I don’t have a TV in my room.” Naser replied. Reed looked disappointed but took a quick puff of something he took from his pocket and went back to a dazed state. Naser sighed and lead the two up to his room. His bedroom was just big enough for Reed and anon to roll out their sleeping bags a reasonable distance away from each other. Reed took the side closest to Naser’s bed and Anon the side of the wall. After that they took turns heading off to the bathroom to get changed. Anon’s PJs were plain green while Naser’s was somehow the same pattern he had on his jacket. And Reeds was pink with a pattern of small joint smoking T-rex’s covering the entirety of it. </p><p>      Naser took a glance at Reed and seemed nervous, well a different kind of nervous. Though Anon was to socially inept to pick up on anything. “Yo bro you’re looking stressed, if you need any help…” Reed began.</p><p>      “No Reed I’m fine, now we need to get some sleep. It’s gonna be hard enough to achieve as soon as Fang starts going off on her guitar.” Naser interrupted. Anon didn’t feel the need to get involved. He had to get up early to run some errands anyway. Naser clicked the lights off and everyone got under their covers. Reed almost instantly started snoring so it took a bit for Anon to achieve slumber but the muffled sound of fangs guitar a few rooms down finally helped him sleep. </p><p>      Only for him to wake up a few hours later into the night to see Naser tossing and turning in his bed. Clearly having a rough time of things. Reed was up to, and slowly crawling up the side of the bed! Anon’s eyes went wide, followed by him quietly muttering to himself and seemingly coming to a decision to remain silent, closing his eyes only halfway. Reed continued his climb until his body was held up by his arms directly over Naser’s own. Naser stopped turning and laid straight, his eyes snapping open. Amazingly, he didn’t immediately scream in horror and thrash around. Instead, he sighed and looked into Reeds now gentle eyes and spoke. “Reed… we can’t do this again and not with Anon right over there.”</p><p>      “Bro you need this tonight. A bro can tell.” Reed said, looking down at Naser’s groin where a stiff tent had been pitched. “Dammit fine…bro but you got to start helping me with my stress in more discreet places then my house.” Naser relented. Reed nodded apologetically and backed on down to his bro’s crotch. Where he slowly pulled down Naser’s pants, letting his long rod spring out. He then reached into his bag beside the bed and brought out a bottle of lube. Covering his hands in the stuff before setting to work methodically pumping Naser’s member. Naser let out a few sporadic gasps and groans. Bringing a wry smile to Reed’s face. </p><p>      “Time to be a real bro.” Reed said sensually. Now that Naser’s dick was lubed as can be, Reed took things further. Pulling his owns jams down and swaying his tail hypnotically. He put his arms around behind Naser’s shoulders and used them as grips as he positioned his smooth, light pink, rear over Naser’s crotch before lowering himself down. Naser’s face was a mix of embarrassed and aroused as he looked into Reed’s face. Reed returned the look with a droozy smile and rapidly bouncing eyebrows. The rut started out with Reed doing most of the work, coming up and down on his bro’s dick as pre started to dribble from the tip of his own.</p><p>      Then something awakened in Naser, an expression conveying intense lust overcame his face and his hips started bucking. Thrusting hard like a jack hammer into Reed. It was now Reed’s turned to gasp and let out a shaky moan. Intense muttering was faintly heard from the corner of the room before a new weight was felt on the bed and hands reached around either side of Reed and grabbed his dick. “You need a bro for yourself Reed.” He heard Anon say while the human’s hands started jerking him off. </p><p>      It did not take long at this pace for Reed and Naser to reach their climaxes. Reed came first. He groaned deeply as his load shot forwards into Naser’s face. Naser tried to close his mouth but a little of Reed’s seed got in first before he swallowed and came. Pumping Reed full of pent up spooge. Reed’s ass cheeks clenched and he happily took all of his bro’s burden. Everyone clenched their respective cheeks harder when the light to Naser’s room turned on. The trio’s heads swiveled around to see Fang’s Dad standing in the doorway. The big man had a thousand-yard stare in his eyes and he took one long chug of his beer can, staring Naser in the eyes for a moment before flicking the light off and slamming the door shut in front of him. </p><p>      Everyone’s face was beet red and they slowly dislodged from each other. Doing a quick clean up in silence and going back to bed. There was no more movement from Naser. The next morning Reed was already gone before Anon woke up. Naser only gave him a look as if to convey the importance of never saying what had happened here. Anon concluded that he and Reed would no longer be sleeping in Naser’s room and made quick work of gathering his things. On his way out he had one more encounter with Fang’s father. “Maybe I don’t have to worry about you and Fang after all. But stay away from Naser or this Club will be going up your ass no lube!” He yelled as Anon bolted out the door. A confused Fang looking out the window of her room at her escaping boyfriend.   </p>
