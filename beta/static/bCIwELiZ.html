                    <p>Garden of Rosa</p><p>​</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>A few weeks passed since my first date with Rosa. Rosa and I had been spending a lot more time together, and her and Stella seemed to mingle well with the rest of the Fang Gang. It was strange to think that at the beginning of the year, I was bound and determined to coast through under the radar, invisible. Now, not only had I accumulated a handful of friends, I even had a… girlfriend. A beautiful Latina Dino Gee-Eff. I was even shitposting less as of late, my hands automatically texting Rosa whenever I whipped out my phone to visit my favorite Mongolian throat-singing IRC. </p><p>Good job Anon, you’ve ruined your chances at wizardry.</p><p>Still, it wasn’t all good. It seemed Rosa was a little embarrassed about our first kiss, the word having gotten around to her family that she was making out with some skinny out in Old Town. Since then, the most I’d gotten to do with her is hold hands as I walked her to class. For us being in a dino-human relationship, most people in the school seemed to be alright with it, actually. Reed had shot me his patent-pending double finger-guns when he first noticed us, accompanied by a very serious “Broooo!”. Even the purple menace, Trish, seemed pleased; at least, I choose to assume her shoulder-punch that day was in congratulations, no matter how hard it hurt. The only one who seemed less than enthused was Fang. She seemed…sad, when she saw Rosa and I walking together to lunch, her face falling as her hands had twitched towards her wing. She hid it well, though, teasing me later that day about how there was no way I could survive Rosa’s cooking. But I caught her looking at me when she thought I couldn’t see, that same sad expression on her face.</p><p>…</p><p>Did Fang…</p><p>No way, we’re just friends, right?</p><p>…Yeah, just friends.</p><p>So why do I feel so awkward when I’m around her? The other day, Fang asked for help in finding a venue for the band to play, Trish and Reed apparently finding other things more important than getting a good location to play at. I tagged along with Fang as she trekked all across the city, escorted by Naser and Naomi. Naomi kept asking about Rosa, how we were doing, saying how glad she was at our “blossoming relationship”. The whole thing set Fang off, and by the time we found a place to play – Dino-Moe’s, her uncle’s pizza shop – I thought Fang was going to choke Naomi out with her own tongue. Fang barely said goodbye to me when I left her house that night, mumbling her thanks as she trudged up to her room, leaving me standing in the doorway with the Chiffon Commandant. </p><p>“Si, I worry about Fang, An-on. We should do something nice for them!” Rosa added the next day at lunch. I was hanging out with her and Stella today, Fang and the gang needing all the time they could get to practice for their concert. Rosa and I were holding hands again under the table, a habit we’d developed since our first date.  “They work so hard on their banda, it must be difficult, when no one…” Rosa’s voice trailed off, the three of us suddenly very introspective about the state of our food. It was true that Fang’s first concert hadn’t gone over very well, and we all dreaded the same thing was going to happen this next time. </p><p>“You said they were doing better now, right Anon? Fang’s playing the guitar now, that’s got to be better!” Stella’s voice was her usual upbeat cheeriness, but I could tell she too was worried. </p><p>“Yeah, a lot better than that double-bass get-up they were using.” I mentally cringe, recalling the time Reed whipped out his phone to show us a recording of VVURM DRAMA’s early days. Ouch. The thought of a performance like that doesn’t sound like the best way to spend a Saturday, but the thought of getting to go to the concert with Rosa… Even though we’ve been going out for a while now, most of that time was spent together at school or talking walks at a park or getting a bite to eat. Going to the concert together would be a big step in our relationship. “Fang’s really excited about this concert, though. They really want to shove it in the faces of people who didn’t believe in them before.” I’m stalling for time, hoping I can muster up the courage to ask Rosa out without a serious pasta spill. </p><p>“I did a tarot reading the other day for them, and it came out really well! I’m sure it’ll all go smoothly.” Stella’s face was full of self-satisfaction as she took another sip of whatever Japanese soda she had imported, as if her tarot reading had all but confirmed the concert would go off without a hitch. </p><p>“Still, I wish there was something else we could do. I preocupa about Fang, Stella, and no amount of your Diablo-worship will stop that!” Rosa wagged her finger at Stella, a gesture she did often whenever Stella’s tarot readings came up. I learned quickly I wasn’t the only guy in a relationship with Rosa: Raptor Jesus had got there first, and I was gonna have to share. </p><p>Stella opened her mouth, no doubt a retort prepared for her old friend. If I didn’t ask Rosa now, I would have to sit through another argument about the importance of one’s immortal soul, and how Raptor Jesus had sacrificed himself for all of us, dino or human. </p><p>The moment of truth was at hand.</p><p>“We’ll just have to be there, to support the band, to support Fang.” I can already feel my face blushing. Taking a deep breath, I tried to keep my voice calm. “S-speaking of, Rosa, did you want to… you know, uh, come to the concert with me?” I glance shyly at Rosa, hoping my palm isn’t too sweaty against her hand underneath the table. Rosa flashes me a big smile, her cheeks reddening slightly as she gives my hand a squeeze.</p><p>“Aww, mi novio! Of course I will go to the concert with you, tonto. I am just glad you asked me before I asked you!” Rosa moved her other hand to caress my cheek, something she always did when I did something she found particularly sweet. I smiled back at her, her crimson eyes locking in with mine.</p><p>“Oh. My. GOD! You guys are so cuuuuuuute!” </p><p>One of these days Stella, one of these days…</p><p>A ear-splitting squee from Stella interrupted our moment, causing Rosa to withdraw her hand from my face quickly. “WhatareyougoingtowearRosa? I’ve got this SUPER cute outfit you can borrow if you want. I was gonna wear it, but then I…” I turn my attention back to my food, chuckling as Rosa turned her attention to her best friend. I knew better than to get between my girlfriend and her best friend, especially when they were chatting about clothes. </p><p>My girlfriend, huh.</p><p>…feels nice to say.</p><p>***</p><p>The night of the concert approached quickly. I arrived early to help the gang set up, Rosa agreeing to meet me there with Stella closer to showtime. Mercifully, Fang seemed to be more like her old self around me, laughing and joking around as I helped Reed run the sound check and set up the stage. I could tell she was nervous, they all were; this was going to be the first time playing in front of others since the disaster my first day. Offering what encouragement and support I could, I left them in the back room of Dino-Moe’s, a text from Rosa saying her and Stella were there.</p><p>Stepping back into the restaurant proper, I was surprised at the crowd that showed up. The place was packed, filling the none-too-small space Moe had set aside for us. Scanning the room, I finally caught a glimpse of a twin pair of green space-buns near the back of the crowd. Shouldering through the crowd towards Stella, I am ill-prepared for what awaits me.</p><p>“Anonnnnnn, this place looks great!” Stella flashes me a big smile when she sees me. Apparently her outfit plans had fallen through, and her simple white t-shirt displaying a familiar slogan was accompanied by her regular shorts. Trying not to think how well “oppai” described Stella, I turned my attention towards what was currently taking my breath away: Rosa. Her floral print dress was swapped out for a tight red spaghetti-strap crop-top and tight jeans, the plunging neckline exposing Rosa’s expansive cleavage, the waist-high jeans clinging to her every curve. Rosa’s usual sandals were gone, replaced by a pair of high-heeled pumps that caused her already ample ass to stick out seductively. A smokey grey eye-shadow graced her eyes, and her lashes had been curled to perfection. She was wearing lip-stick, a sinful red color on the end of her snoot. Even her hair was different, shimmering in the light of the restaurant like stars in the night sky. Raptor Jesus help me, she was gorgeous! </p><p>“D-do you, uh, like it, An-on? Stella said it made me look muy hermosa…” Rosa was fidgeting with her crop-top, alternating between pulling the low neckline up to hide her large bosom, and pulling the bottom down to cover more of her stomach. “I told her it was too short, too exposición, but she didn’t listen!” Her little black clutch swings widely as Rosa gestures with her hands, a sure sign of her emotions.</p><p>“Actually, what I said was it made you look super hot, Rosa! It’s from an anime Anon, I can give you the title later.” Stella gave me a wink and a nudge before heading out into the crowd, an enormous shark-like dinosaur who I vaguely remember being on the football team scooping her up in his arms and twirling her about. </p><p>Stella, you are forgiven.</p><p>“Rosa, you look…wow. I-I mean, you look really, really nice. Not just nice! Better, uh… you look really hot. Not hot, beautiful! Not that you’re not hot too, uh, it’s just, you know, you look…” Unable to find the right mix of praising Rosa’s look without sounding too much like the horny teenager I am, I continue to stammer. Seems I didn’t avoid that spaghetti spill after all. Rosa stands there, blushing beneath my admiration as my eyes track up and down her body repeatedly. </p><p>Mercifully, a cheer from the crowd ends my suffering. Glancing over, I see that VVURM DRAMA has taken the stage at last, Fang and Trish shouldering their instruments as Reed takes his position behind the drums. Immediately they launch into their first song of the set, eliciting another roar of approval from the crowd. A rough mosh-pit has already opened up in front of the stage, the crowd jumping and dancing in time with the music. Turning back to Rosa, I manage to take her by the hand, leaning over to shout in her ear above the noise.</p><p>“Do you wanna dance?” An eager nod from Rosa is all I need to lead her out into the crowd. Before long, the two of us are jumping up and down like the rest of them, throwing our hands in the air like we, indeed, just do not care. A glance over to Rosa reveals she’s having fun, laughing and cheering the band along in rapid Spanish. The jumping of the mosh pit sends her breasts heaving up and down, threatening to bounce out of the small top at any moment, but Rosa doesn’t seem to care, too caught up in the music to notice. I can’t peel my eyes away, however, making a mental note to ask Stella for the name of that anime. As I finally pull my eyes away from what is the biggest chest I’ve ever seen, I notice Rosa’s been staring at me this whole time! Blushing, I try to say something, anything, over the music, but Rosa just smiles at me, a mixture of embarrassment and self-satisfaction spreading on her face. Did she want me to check her out?!</p><p>The set goes on for roughly an hour, the crowd singing along to Reed’s incomprehensible lyrics as best they can. Some of the crowd had gotten a little rowdy by the end, and I managed to watch out of the corner of my eye Stella going down at the front of the mosh pit, her chad-shark companion too busy head-banging to care. By the finale, the band is soaked in sweat, and Fang’s one last mad strumming is met with thunderous applause and cheers from the assembled crowd. I applaud just as hard, and Rosa’s shouts of “¡bis!” join in with the rest of the crowd’s cheers. As the band begins to walk off-stage the crowd disperses, leaving Rosa and I standing there, beaming at each other. Rosa is covered in sweat, her body glistening in the light of the restaurant, and I struggle to keep my eyes on her face. Taking both my hands in hers, Rosa gives a few excited hops up and down, giggling to herself. I’ve got to grit my teeth this time to not look down.</p><p>“An-on, they were maravillosa! Fang seemed so happy on stage! Ahh, me divertí mucho!” Rosa pulls me into a hug, pressing her sweaty body against mine. Hoping she can’t feel how happy I am to see her, I hug her back, my hands inadvertently stroking her hair as I do so. Rosa settles her chin on my shoulder, pressing her sweat-damp cheek into my own as I lean my head down. This close to her, I can smell her scent, a heady aroma of sweat mixed in with her familiar floral smell. There’s something else as well, some sort of perfume that wasn’t there before, and before I can stop myself I inhale more of her, smiling. Rosa’s body feels nice pressed against mine, and I hug her tighter, feeling the not insignificant weight of her breasts against my chest. By now I’ve learned to ignore the alarms in my head, instead filling it wholly with the sensation of Rosa.</p><p>After a moment our embrace ends, and my hands find themselves resting on her waist. “Yeah, they were great, the whole band…” Glancing up at me, Rosa wraps her arms neck, our faces dangerously close to one another. All I can do is stare at her, my mind filled with her smell, her face, her body. Filled with how beautiful and sexy she is, how happy she looks right now, her smile splitting her face. </p><p>Damn, but I wanna protect that smile. </p><p>Slowly, we lean into each other, our lips parting. Something catches Rosa’s smokey red eyes, causing her to glance towards the stage even as mine close entirely. Suddenly, Rosa pulls away from me, leaving me to make duck-lips at no one as she turns her head.</p><p>“Stella!” Rosa rushes over to her friend at once. Apparently things had gotten a little too rowdy in that mosh pit, and by the look of Stella she had suffered the worst of it. “Ro I am so sorry Stella! Come, I shall nurse you back at my home! Anon, help me carry her to the car!” Pulling Stella’s arm over her shoulder, I’m reminded just how strong Rosa is as she drags the dazed woman to her feet. Hurrying over to help, I take Stella’s other arm, and between the two of us we manage to drag Stella through the thinning crowd to where Rosa’s car is parked outside. Muttering to herself about how she should have never let Stella out of her sight, Rosa manages to drop Stella into the back seat, buckling her in before turning back to me, mopping her brow. </p><p>“Is Stella going to be alright?” The cool night air feels nice, a welcome relief after the heat of the dance floor, but I still feel flushed every time Rosa glances towards me. </p><p>“Si, si, she should be fine. Ohhh, those bastardos! If I find out who did this…” Rosa mutters to herself in Spanish as she fiddles with her clutch, finding her keys at last. Her face is vivid, nearly as angry as when I had fallen into her flowers.</p><p>“Do…do you want me to help, at all? I can go with you to…” My voice trails off, my hands flopping to my sides. This wasn’t how I imagined this night to end, with Rosa leaving to go nurse a concussed Stella back to life. I suspect it wasn’t how Rosa wanted things to end either, with how close we were at the end of the band’s performance. Rosa looks up at me once more, the anger vanishing from her face at once. Pouting her lips, Rosa puts her hand to my cheek once more.</p><p>“Aww, mi novio! It’s okay, I can manage. Oh lo siento mucho, An-on, I have to run off on our little date night.” Rosa slowly strokes the side of my face, a tender touch of her fingertips. “I’ll make it up to you, okay?” </p><p>I smile, taking Rosa’s hand in mine and giving it a little squeeze. A sudden moment of realization makes me understand what those squeezes were, for us: A tender expression of our mutual attraction for one another. In the absence of kissing, it was what Rosa and I had adopted to say just how much the other one meant to us. Rosa squeezes back, her crimson eye staring up at mine.</p><p>“That’s okay Rosa, I’ll text you later toni – mmph!”</p><p>My voice is cut off as Rosa leans up to kiss me. Unlike our tender kisses we shared weeks before, this one is hard, almost savage, Rosa biting my lip slightly as her tongue enters my mouth, teasing my own before caressing across the inside of my lips, both bottom and top. There’s a hunger in Rosa’s kiss, a sense of wanting something more, like a starving man settling into their first meal. Eventually, Rosa settles back down, slowly breaking apart as a soft sigh escapes our lips. A trail of saliva links us together momentarily before Rosa licks her lips, as if to savor the taste of me.</p><p>“I PROMISE I’ll make it up to you, mi novio. Goodnight, An-on. Text me, si?” Rosa flashes a mischievous grin as she walks to the other side of the car, raising her eyebrows as she gets in. Bidding me goodbye with a honk and a wave, Rosa drives off, leaving me standing dazed and confused on the curb. I raise one hand to my lips, wiping off a remnant of lip-stick that had transferred to me. Smiling, I start making my way home, not caring about how far the walk to Skin row was, or how late it was. </p><p>She promised, huh?</p>
