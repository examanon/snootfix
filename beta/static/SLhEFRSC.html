Finally, another day of school over with. Trudging laboriously up to my shitty apartment, I fumble the keys out of my pocket. How the hell had Fang convinced Spears to let her out of sixth period this semester? She could’ve at least waited for me, her damn boyfriend, before heading off. I know she’s got her own stuff going on, but it would still be nice to see her after school. I push open my apartment door, dumping my backpack on the floor before a voice nearly sends me out of my skin.</p><p>“Hey Anon, what’s up babe?” It was Fang, a mischievous look in her amber eyes. Her quick peck on my cheek in greeting left me fumbling for words like an idiot, still too stunned at her sudden appearance in my apartment. How long had she been here?</p><p>“Just stopped by to grab my guitar. Left it here by mistake, and I’ve got a jam sesh with Trish tonight.” The words tumbled out in a flood, Fang nearly tripping over herself to explain what she was doing. As she hoisted her guitar case up, I could see her face was flushed, her beathing labored. “I’ll catch you later, okay?” </p><p>“Y-yeah, y-you too.” Nice fucking going Anon. My eyes flicker over to my computer screen, a sinking feeling opening up in my stomach. Shit, did I forget to clean up today?</p><p>Fang laughs, giving me a quick jab on the shoulder before pulling the door open. “You gotta work on your mumbling dude. Anyways, laters!”</p><p>The second Fang left, I fly to my computer. How could I have forgotten to delete the browser history this morning?! Ever since Fang started dropping by unexpectedly (thanks Naser, for getting her a copy of my key), I had been diligently making sure to hide my power-level as much as possible: All Saturina wallpapers archived and deleted, all anime torrenting paused, all browser history deleted every day before school. But today… I had been in such a rush to leave, I had forgotten all of my careful steps to isolate my weeb-side from my girlfriend. It was bad enough she had seen those photoshops I had made last year; no way she would stick around if she thought I jerked it to anime titties and was downloading the entirety of K-On! off of my usually Scandinavian basket weaving forum!</p><p>I tried to keep my heartbeat down as I jammed my password into my computer. Fuck, how could I have told Fang that as well?! Here we go, finally. Now, to open my trusty copy of FlintFox, navigate to the browser history, scroll down aaaaand…My hand froze, the blood in my veins turning to ice. Not only had I not deleted my browser history, but Fang had also totally seen it! Entries from last night littered the screen, threads from all my usual boards mapping out a list of Fang’s snooping. Video Games, Anime & Manga, Mecha; They all painted a clear picture of my desperate neetdom, and Fang had seen it all. I slumped back in my chair, unable to tear my eyes off the screen. Cradling my head in my hands a thin wail began to escape my lips. It was over.</p><p>Wait a minute…. The last thing I had checked out, a tasteful “Is food bad for you?” thread, WASN’T the last thing that was viewed. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to re-focus on the screen, delving deeper into just what Fang had been looking at. It seemed she had done a little digging into how much of a hopeless loser I was, checking out the anime board first, the threads ranging from normie-tier Dino-Ball-Z discussion (Rosa’s influence) to shitty slice-of-life harem shit (Stella’s hand, no doubt). From there, she migrated over to Mecha for a bit, checking out some imported models from Japan that I made sure to save for later viewing. A shitpost thread or two on Video Games kept her interest for a bit, and then…</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>She had found the pink boards.</p><p>Random; Politically Incorrect; Cams & Meetups. It was like a who’s-who of desperate internet losers. Nothing on each of those boards seemed to keep her attention for long, thank goodness, but I couldn’t help my mind from spinning out the worse case scenarios for each board. How would Fang tolerate a wrecked thread? A meteor-dodger one? What about the porn? Surely Fang couldn’t have missed those, they were all over the place!</p><p>The more I scrolled up, the worse it got, however. It seemed Fang not only found the porn threads, but found a LOT of them.  Big titty threads, big ass threads, anime porn threads. Reading the evidence of Fang’s discoveries, I couldn’t help but begin to wail again. If she thought this is what I looked at all the time I was on the computer, I was fucking finished. I could almost hear her dad storming into my apartment, his golf-club raised high with murderous intent after Fang blabbed that I spent my time jerking it to shitty nudes. Or maybe it would be Naser, setting out to do more than just shove me against some school lockers. I wanted to bury my face in my hands, close the tab, pull the plug; anything to avoid facing the truth of what happened. But still I continued to scroll, digging myself a deeper grave with each little spin of the wheel.  </p><p>Thank Raptor Jesus on his cross of rock I forced myself to keep going.</p><p>From the entry-level pink boards, Fang had turned her search in a decidedly more erotic direction. LGBT became Handsome Men became Sexy Beautiful Women. Page after page and thread after thread of softcore porn rolled on, no one thread keeping Fang’s attention for very long. From there, it was over to Adult GIF. From the look of my browsing history, she must’ve visited every single thread on that board! My rictus of fear slowly gave way to a shit-eating grin as I investigated further. The usual threads – Blowjob, YLYL, Amateurs – were on the list, none really catching Fang’s eye, until at last, Fang had found her holy grail: Human-male-on-dino-female. </p><p>Evidence of dozens of threads flowed by, hundreds of images providing detailed evidence of Fang’s depraved fetish. From the looks of things, she must’ve opened every single image she could’ve found, and from the timestamps on each they were open for a while. Suddenly, her flushed face and mischievous look made more sense. So that’s what she had been doin! With a wicked grin, I grabbed my phone, pulling open the messenger app, intent on a little revenge.</p><p>Anon: saw what u were doing ;)</p><p>Anon: tonite u wana see the real thing?</p><p>A brief pause, and then Fang’s response sent my phone buzzing.</p><p>Fang: OMG yes please <;V</p></div>
