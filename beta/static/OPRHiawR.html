This is important."</p><p>>there's that Trish I knew and loathed</p><p>>I roll my eyes and let her lead me all the way outside to the garden shed</p><p>>"Okay, we're in the middle of nowhere.

Stupid fucking ape. Never gonna look at Fang again..."</p><p>>I'm not so sure about that, but it looks like Trish is in her own world</p><p>>May as well enjoy myself too</p><p>>I start to thrust up into her, matching her every time she drops down</p><p>>this catches her off guard and the smug front breaks into breathy groans mixed with half finished derogatory insults about humans</p><p>"Ugly ape."
