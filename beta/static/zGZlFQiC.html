And he needed to find something to him calm down. Now this had not been his first choice, but as he pulled the Nascar up to Reed’s van Naser knew he would need this for the coming days. Getting out of his car, Naser strolled up and knocked on the van’s side shakily. The large door slid open and a pink raptor peeked his head out. “Yo Naser! You accepted my invite. Nice.” Reed said waving Naser inside. Naser climbed on in and crouched to the side of Reed who closed the door and turned to him. </p><p>       “Look bro I know how hard it’s been for ya, so I’m glad you came to have a nice few puffs with me. It’ll calm ya right down bro, no long-term addiction guaranteed. And if you need to offload some shit on a bro I’ll be right here. Taking a trip with ya.” </p><p>       Naser was still hesitant. He told himself this was a one-time thing and he would never sink this low again. If anything, the thought of his father’s retribution held him to that. They both took a seat at the back of the van. Reed wasted no time in taking out a bong, bringing his lighter up under it, and inhaling the first vapes. Then he lazily passed it to Naser who hesitated a few seconds before remembering all he had been through with handling Naomi and his sister the last few years and he finally took the boof. Inhaling it like the newbie he was and coughing hard until he learned to pace himself.</p><p>       The world became blurry and Naser gave a droopy smile. He now understood that Reed was living the good life. No nagging control freak of a girlfriend, never letting him do anything she didn’t expressively approve of. Even after high school she controlled everything down to their sex life, not letting him have release until she felt it was right! What a bitch! In Naser’s now drug addled state his mind was free from his usual inhibitions and a need to release all his stress would no longer be stopped by a now nonexistent self-control.     </p><p> </p><p>       Naser slowly unbuckled his pants and dragged them and his undergarments down to his knees with his thumbs. Letting his gene inherited thick, spear like, black shaft, grow to full erection. Reed, who was on cloud nine, registered the phallic sight in blurry detail. Quickly snapping him back to earth as Naser began working his hands up and down his dino pecker, drool running down from the bottom of the man’s beak. Reed now understood that this was a far more serious bro problem than he had first suspected. A full five alarm emergency of a bro in need! </p><p>       Sliding around to Naser’s front view, Reed looked him dead in the eyes and asked “Dude. Mind if a bro helped you out?” Naser’s face seemed to return to lucidity for a quick moment and his face reddened. Though after moment’s contemplation, he sheepishly nodded. Reed’s caring eyes drifted down to Naser’s throbbing member. “Yea don’t you worry bro I’ll take that pent up stress for ya.” After uttering those final words Reed kneeled down and gently slid his body back to the point that his snout was at Naser’s groin and his upper body in-between his legs. </p><p>       Reed took things calmly, wrapping his arms around Naser’s thighs and planting his hands on each of his buttocks. Finally, Reed opened his mouth and lowered it around Naser’s impressive member. His tongue started off pressing down on the top of the now sweaty saft and then easing down the side before circling the entire dick. Swiftly Slickening the dick in its repetitive course while Reed’s jaws closed slowly and he began to bob his head up and down. Getting closer to the base of Naser’s dick each time. A passionate sound erupted from Naser’s mouth, A low deep moaning that ended in a sigh. Tears building from the edges of his eyes. </p><p>       Reed dutifully went on for a few more minutes like this. And though some precum was tasted, Reed could not bring Naser to his climax. The man must have been hard trained by Naomi; Reed concluded. Something more had to be done. Lifting up his head, Reed stood up and turned. Naser looked at Reed pleadingly, worried that he had stopped. Though his eyes went wide when he saw Reed bend over and slip his pants down over his tail and then dropped them to the floor entirely. The pink raptor twink then sensually raised his tail high. Showing his shapely, soft, though still form keeping ass. Reed’s head looked back over his shoulder and his jaws parted to let out a ring of smoke. Which Naser saw as a heart in his inebriated state. </p><p>       Naser was now sweating bullets and tore off his jacket in a vain attempt to cool down. As he did this, Reed lowered himself quite carefully down onto Naser’s rock hard shaft. Reed’s ass cheeks hugged his pole comfortably on its trip to Reed’s exit. Given how wet the shaft now was it was a tight but quick pop of an insertion. Not wanting to treat Naser the same as Naomi had. Reed began to quickly pump up and down on Naser’s bone. Soft ass slapped against Naser’s groin as Reed’s long, fluffy tail swayed up and down in sync with the bouncing.</p><p>       “Reed…. I” Naser said in-between huffs and puffs. “Don’t’ sweat it bro, just giving you what you need” Reed said through strained grunts. Reed felt a powerful tensing in the shaft that was now deep inside him and brought his ass down fully one final time. Naser let out a strong gasp as a wave of pure bliss and heat smothered him and he at last came hard. Load after load shot deep into Reed quivering ass, seemingly never ending. Causing his tail to curl up around Naser’s body. The cum entering Reed felt thick and hot, but cooling fast. The two bros sat connected like so for a time. Riding both the afterglow of the intercourse and the drugs. </p><p>       At last Reed found the strength to dislodge himself from Naser and stood up. And Naser pulled his pants back up after cleaning off any residual cum that hadn’t stayed inside his bro. He then stood up, collected his jacket and opened up the Van door. Giving one look back at Reed, Naser tried to get out a sentence. “Reed…. look about this…” </p><p>       “Don’t harp on it dude, A bro’s gotta do what a bro’s gotta do.” Interrupted Reed, doing his classic Finger bang towards Naser. The shaken Naser gave a curt nod and let a little smile show as he walked back to his Nascar. Now knowing that drugs might not be his only new addiction to worry about.  </p></div>
