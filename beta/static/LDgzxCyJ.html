Lucy walked with her hands comedically outstretched in front of her, acting like she would find a new obstacle with every step. We were walking through the city park where we had reunited six months ago, soft twilight enveloping everything in a dim light interrupted only by the park’s lamps as the twinkled on, one by one. With my face this close to Lucy, I can smell her hair, the delicate mix of coconut and orange blossoms filling my nose. In the time since I returned to Volcaldera, I had tried to fill my entire life with her, working hard to absorb as much of her as I could. Hardly a day had gone by when we didn’t see each other, but picking up our relationship after such a long time away hadn’t been easy: Lucy had changed, more than just what she had admitted to me that first night we were together. She seemed tense, as though she was still protecting herself from something, a feeling that I suspected only got worse when I was gone. I often caught her staring off into space when she didn’t think I could see, a morose expression on her face. Seeing her in those moments would break my heart just a little bit, but ultimately only served to deepen my instinct to protect her. Tonight, however, she was all smiles, her beauty on full display even as I picked her up from her parents house. Ripley and Sam had become like another set of parents to me as well, and had done wonders to support us through the early stumbles of our relationship. Sam was especially overjoyed to hear Lucy and I had started dating again, and it seemed my time spent in the deserts during the war had done wonders to improve Ripley’s opinion of me. The expression on his face when I had informed him of my plans for tonight as we waited for Lucy to get ready for our date had be priceless.  </p><p>“Anon, geez, can’t you just tell me where we’re going?” Lucy asks, laughing as her heel catches momentarily on something unseen on the concrete path. I had made her close her eyes a few blocks away from the park, but I could do little to hide the cool night air or the smell of the water from her. Both of us are wearing our best formal wear, Lucy resplendent in an amber-colored halter dress, a cream-colored wrap draped over her arms, a string of pearls from her mother around her neck. I had donned my old dress uniform, slightly surprised that it still fit after these months of Sam’s filling Sunday church lunches. Neither the sort of thing one would usually wear when trekking across a public park late at night, but I had promised Lucy something special tonight, and I intended to make good on that promise.</p><p>“Hey now, I said no hints! It’ll spoil the surprise…” I whisper in her ear, feeling her body tremble slightly as I do so. I slow Lucy to a stop, careful not to press into her wings too harshly, keeping my body well back from her. My heart was beating out of my chest, now that we were so close to our destination, and I didn’t want the soft pitter-patter of my heart against her wings to give away the surprise. We weren’t far from the bench where we reunited, the spot I had picked out for our date this evening. In truth, that spot that would always hold a special place in my heart, and we had re-visited that park bench so many times over our relationship I was worried Lucy would recognize where we were going by feel alone. Giggling as I accidently bumped her into a trash can, Lucy moved her hands to mine, half-heartedly attempting to pull them away.</p><p>“Pleeeeese? Just a little peak? I’m sure it won’t spoil anything…”</p><p>“No, no peeking babe!” The nervousness gives my voice a slight edge as I hold my hands firmly against her eyes. Lucy immediately drops her hands, and I can feel her body tense up slightly. It’s the same reaction whenever I raise my voice even a little around her, or put my foot down on an issue. But Lucy always yields, and I quickly reassure her everything is ok, hoping to dispel any unwarranted tension. “Please Lucy, just a few more steps, then you can open your eyes, okay?” </p><p>“Okay Anon, I trust you,” Lucy responds, as meek as milk. Kissing her on the top of her head, I guide her the rest of the short distance towards the bench, removing my hands from her eyes at last.   </p><p>“Okay, open your eyes…” I whisper, my hands now resting on her shoulders. Slowly, Lucy blinks her eyes open, those amber orbs drinking in the bench before her, drinking in what I had planned hours before hand. Draped across the seat of the bench is a white cloth, dozens of red camellia petals strewn over the surface. Thirty-six small candles also dotted the bench, resting on small plates and dishes I had carefully collected from Lucy’s mom. Sitting in the middle of all of this was a small box, suitable only for a small piece of jewelry or other keepsake. In this case, a ring.</p><p>Grinning, I watch Lucy’s face over her shoulder, a wondering realization filled her face. Tears filled her eyes as she covered her snoot with her hands, a beaming smile already splitting her mouth. Choking back a sob, Lucy turned her face to look at me, pulling her hands away from her mouth with a shudder.</p><p>“Oh, Anon, it’s beautiful… The flowers, the candles…”</p><p>“One for each month we were apart!” I interject, too excited to keep my mouth shut. Lucy chokes back another sob, tears of unbridled joy running down her face. Smiling, I nod my head to the small box on the bench, releasing her shoulders as she steps forward, her heels clacking on the concrete. Leaning over, Lucy takes the box in a trembling hand, turning back to be with another sob as she cradles it near to her heart. “Go ahead Lucy, open it.”</p><p>Taking a deep breath to calm herself, Lucy fans her eyes with one hand, the box held tightly in the other. She makes one final unsuccessful attempt to bite back tears before opening the box, letting out a squeal of excitement when she sees what’s inside: A wedding band of simple gold, the not-insignificant diamond sparkling in the soft candle light amid its setting. Lucy’s eyes momentarily diverted, I take the opportunity to get down on one knee before her, reaching my hands out to hers.</p><p>“Lucy, will you marry me?”</p></div>
