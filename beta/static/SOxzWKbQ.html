I thought-? No, no, I will do this the proper way!"</p><p>>Trish just smiled. You took a moment to gather your thoughts, and realized that you were sweating despite the cool air.</p><p>>"Alright, then."</p><p>>You turned to face her and tried to put your coolest face.</p><p>>"Hey, my name is Anon. Anon Y. Mous. What's yours, babe?"</p><p>>In an attosecond, her face went from baffled, amused, mortified... and then she smiled this awkward smile, where her lips barely curled upwards and her eyes had this strange light in them and her face became oddly bashful...</p><p>>She became more and more flustered.</p><p>>"Babe...?! Tullip. No! I mean, my name is Trish Tullip!"</p><p>>"Really?"</p><p>>"Really!"</p><p>>"That's a nice name. I'm serious, how did this never come up?"</p><p>>"It's just my surname. It's nothing special..."</p><p>>"It's your name. That's what makes it special to me!"</p><p>>Holy shit, were you on a roll or what? Nothing but nat 20 on your CHA dice-rolls tonight!</p><p>>"Do you have any hobbies, Anon? Like, an instrument?"</p><p>>You caught the hint.</p><p>>"Eh, not really. I took a course in muscial enginering however."</p><p>>You talked and talked, learned things you haven't known about each other before, and by the time your friends came to pick you up, Trish and you sat close to each other, her head on your shoulder, both of you never really looking away from each eyes.</p><p>>This was nice.</p>
