<h1>Backstory</h1><div><p>The Backstory:</p><p>​</p><p>-Volcano High, on the surface, appears to be your average school. Unknown to most, however, VH is a privately owned school that doesn’t belong to any of Dinofornia’s various school districts. As such, it is well-funded by a combination of community donations, as well as from private investors consisting of various groups of interest, such as tech companies, wealthy and eccentric patrons of the arts, and the occasional mysteriously wealthy benefactor who may or may not have shady connections.</p><p>-As a result, Volcano High mains a pristine infrastructure when compared to other schools in the area, they are able to hire and maintain their own staff of experts without having to rely on the mandates of a school district often more concerned with making money than helping out the students, and perhaps most importantly of all, they are able to provide all those attending—students and staff alike—with nutritious and savory food that by no means was once meant to be consumed by prison inmates.</p><p>-Principal Spears is the current CEO and headmaster of Volcano High, and he runs a very tight ship on his school. Though his official titles are CEO and Headmaster, he likes to go with the title of ‘Principal’ instead, as it makes him feel more approachable. </p><p>-Spears has impeccably run Volcano High for 20-odd years. Hard to believe that Spears was at one point a student of VH. In fact, he was the only other human student to ever attend Volcano High up until recently. This was because the previous principal brought him in specifically to bolster the school's reputation by allowing 'integration' at a time when it was not yet a widely allowed practice. While the act did bring Volcano High some recognition (as well as its fair share of derision), it ultimately did not work due to Volcano High’s location and perceived 'exclusivity' among the community, a fact that sadly remains the same even after all those years. </p><p>-For the last 10 years, Spears has tried very hard to get more human students to attend his school. He’s had some successes ever since integration of schools became the norm, but he’s only ever succeeded in bringing in a small handful of humans over the years. True, most of them went on to become successful in their own respective ways, but none ever really caught his eye since they kept to themselves and did not really mingle with the rest of the student body, instead choosing to isolate themselves and ‘coast along’ without attracting too much attention to themselves.</p><p>-Such is the fate of humans in predominantly dino schools... </p><p>-But then, one day near the end of 201M2020 BC’s summer, Principal Spears decides that maybe he's been looking in the wrong place for a human student to bring in. He figures that maybe it’s not the best that he needs to court and convince to join his school, but rather those that are down and out and need help the most. It is this decision that leads him to look for more 'troubled' students in and around the various other school districts. </p><p>-While pouring over dozens of files from troubled human youths, he comes across a particularly interesting case that catches his eyes: the case of one Anon Y. Mous. </p><p>-As he reads more about the young man’s situation, he learns how he withdrew from Rock Bottom due to 'excessive bullying' and is searching for a new school to finish the last 6 months of his high-school career, or less suffer the possibility of repeating his whole year for no real reason of his own.  </p><p>-Spears reads more about the particulars of Anon's case, and as he does, he decides to do more digging on the matter in the hopes of discovering if there was more to the young man’s case. He didn’t want to make a hasty decision, after all. </p><p>-It doesn’t take long for Principal Spears to dig deep enough into the matter to discover the string of events that led to Anon’s unfortunate circumstance: a particularly savage case of doxxing, revealing that the human youth holds a deep infatuation with anime. </p><p>-As a fellow Weeb of high-class taste, Principal Spears feels an instant connection with Anon Y Mous. More than that though, he views it as a worthy challenge to take on. </p><p>-If Anon can become a successful student and mingle well with the student body of Volcano High, then he can have a big PR victory, proving that his school is a great place for human students to attend. Barring that, just having a former troubled student turn his life around and go on to become successful would also bring glory to the school’s reputation.</p><p>-Spears begins the process of finalizing the paperwork needed to have Anon transfer over to Volcano High as swiftly as possible. He contacts Rock Bottom's principal to get the rest of Anon's information in order and performs other necessary bureaucratic matters. Whatever he completes, he hands over to Naomi to file and put in order, essentially creating a portfolio of the young human lad before he’s ever able to set foot on Volcano High. </p><p>-Over the course of a day, Spears gets everything in order, and Anon's transfer is more or less completed.</p><p>-The only thing left is to contact the parents and give them the good news...</p><p>SNOOT GAME HAPPENS</p><p>GOLDEN ENDING IS ACHIEVED</p><p>-It’s been five years since the previous class graduated from Volcano High. As Spears bids another class farewell, he prepares to bring back the old class for a reunion. He turns to one of his most recent hires and alumni of the class of 201M2021, Lucy, and he gives her the details of the reunion. Lucy is quite ecstatic, to say the least, as it gives her an excuse to see her old friends again, especially her old flame who she hasn’t seen in person for at least a year, Anon.</p><p>-The class reunion is planned out. Invitations are sent, and the date is settled on. The scheduled time and day arrive sooner than most expected, but it is a welcome surprise to just about everyone.</p><p>-Spears is present during the class reunion and greets everyone warmly, much like a father would greet the children he has not seen in some time. Much to Spear’s delight, more than 90% of those who graduated five years earlier show up, including a few that went out of their way to return home from abroad for the special occasion.</p><p>-Overflowing with pride and emotion, Principal Spears gives a few words to his alumni. In particular, he's interested in Anon. The burly caveman is impressed by the former troubled youth’s growth, both academically, as well as socially. </p><p>-This further proves to Spears that he was right about having Anon attend Volcano High 5 years earlier. </p><p>-He looks back a bit on his life up to that point and sees the promising youths before him. He begins to wonder if any of them could take the mantle he knows he's going to leave behind in two years. This makes him ponder on just who his successor should be. </p><p>-At first, Spears considers Naomi as a possible candidate to take his place, but then he remembers she's already a housewife married to a political figure so that probably wouldn't end well despite all her qualifications as the old student body president. </p><p>-He then considers Lucy next but then realizes that her passion lies with music, and she's to be Jingo's successor anyway, so he can't bring himself to take that from her.  </p><p>-Finally, he thinks about Anon. Anon, more than anyone, proved to him that people can change.</p><p>-As Spears gives his last words and wishes his former students a fond farewell and much luck in their lives, he decides to talk to Anon after the reunion comes to a close. But before he’s able to, Lucy whisks the human away to the School’s rooftop.</p><p>-Spears opts to give his two students some time to themselves as he helps Rosa and Stella, another two of his former students, clean up the place.</p><p>ROOFTOP SCENE WITH ANON AND LUCY HAPPENS</p><p>MUCH GOSLINGS ARE HAD</p><p>-Lucy and Anon return from their little romantic rekindling on the rooftop right as Spears, Rosa, and Stella finish up the cleaning.</p><p>-Just as Anon and Lucy are bidding each other farewell for the evening, Spears decides to approach his two former students. It is at this point that he informs the two that he is planning to retire in two years’ time and that he would like Anon to take his place as Principal of Volcano High. </p><p>-Anon naturally declines the offer at first, but Spears insists, bringing up the fact that Anon grew to become a fine young man despite all of his circumstances pointing in the opposite direction. If anything, his growth in such a short time thanks to Volcano High points to the fact that he already has some of the qualities to be Principal. He just needs a bit of extra learning to really seal the deal.</p><p>-Anon remains unsure, but he can't deny that Spear's words have made him reconsider.  </p><p>-Spears tells Anon that he has two years to accept or decline his offer. If he does accept his offer though, he'll have to work alongside Lucy to familiarize himself with some of the more intricate aspects of the school, such as paperwork and PR. Spears even offers to hire him so that he can get that know-how, all the while not-so-subtly suggesting he can work alongside Lucy so the two don't have to be apart after all the time they already spent away from each other while he was in college.</p><p>-Anon more or less decides to take Spear's offer on hearing that he’ll get a job AND be close to his beloved.</p><p>-Spears is quite happy with the results. So much so that he gives Anon a firm yet gentle hug, almost like a father hugging his son. </p><p>-Anon can’t help but be emotional, as his own father never quite was this warm towards him.</p><p>-Over the next two years, Anon works his butt off learning the ropes of how to be a proper principal from Spears. He also becomes the school's sound engineer (which is his area of expertise after all). He quickly becomes well acquainted with some of his old teachers and a few new ones as well, and his relationship with Lucy's as strong as it’s ever been, even if he sometimes does his Anon shenanigans (such as the wine glass thing). </p><p>-Then the day comes when Spears officially steps down. He's done all the paperwork, he's talked to the board and to the shareholders of the school, he's done everything to ensure the transition from him to Anon goes as smooth as possible. The only thing left is the official announcement, and he can walk off in the sunset with a proud smile on his lips.</p></div>
