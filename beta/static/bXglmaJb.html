                    <p>Title: My True Self..?</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Trish, Reed</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot </p><p>Author: Momanon</p><p>â€‹</p><p>Ah, lunchtime. The best period of the day. Both for a chance to slack of from classes, and for the opportunity to hang out with Fang. I make my way to the auditorium, tray in hand, and push my way through one of the double doors with an arm. To my surprise, however, I'm the only one in here. Odd, usually at least one of the gang manages to beat me here, if not all of them. Ah well, no matter. They'd be along shortly. I take a seat on the edge of the stage, setting my tray down next to me.</p><p>My head picks up as I hear the sound of the auditorium doors opening. Looking towards the source of the noise, I see Fang making her way into the room - or at least, what appears to be her. Those big wings, the color of her scales, the all black attire, and of course that lovely snoot all check out. But she looked... different today. Her boots, normally going most of the way up her shins, were now just a normal pair of combat boots, stopping a little ways above her ankle. Her torn black pants, normally so form fitting and tight, were loose, baggy, spilling over the top of her boots rather than being tucked into them. Her normally revealing cutoff top was replaced with a much more modest T-shirt, adorned with what was presumably the logo of some metal band I had never heard of. And her long, flowing silver hair was now tucked away, bunched up under a black ballcap resting atop her head, with her crest poking out through the back of it. I was so used to seeing her in mostly the same outfit every day that seeing her wearing anything else as regular, day to day wear was frankly kind of jarring.</p><p>I spend so long looking her over that I almost don't register when she speaks to me.</p><p>"Hey, Anon."</p><p>I blink a few times, trying to collect myself. So what if she looks different, she's still Fang.</p><p>"Uhh, hey, Fang. What's with the new look?"</p><p>"Oh, this?"</p><p>She chuckles a bit, looking down and broadly gesturing to herself.</p><p>"Eh, I decided that after everything that's happened, at prom and all that... I think I'm gonna drop the whole 'non-binary' thing. I think I'm finally ready to accept myself for who I really am."</p><p>Wait, what? If anything she looks even more like she's playing into the non-binary schtick than before. Her outfit is leagues less feminine than her usual attire.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>Uh oh.</p><p>Oh no. Oh god. Oh fuck.</p><p>I can feel myself beginning to tense up a little bit as Fang steps in closer, offering me a warm smile and placing her hands on my shoulders.</p><p>"And I have you to thank for that, Anon."</p><p>I'm not sure if it's just my brain fucking with me at this point, but her voice sounds subtly different too. Slightly deeper.</p><p>I think I may be in some deep shit right now.</p><p>"Uhh, Fang, just out of curiosity... What gender were you before your whole 'non-binary' thing?"</p><p>She doesn't answer, instead blushing and turning her head slightly.</p><p>*I'm mildly concerned.*</p><p>"Anon... This doesn't change anything between us, right? I mean... I'm still me. I'm still Fang."</p><p>"Oh, y-yeah, no, of course not."</p><p>I don't even know if I'm telling the truth or not at this point. Of course I still like Fang. My feelings haven't just suddenly vanished or anything. But this... this was not what I bargained for. If what I think is happening is happening, I have no fucking idea how to respond to this.</p><p>Fang, meanwhile, moves in, wrapping... heeeerrrrrrr..? Arms around me, pulling me into a hug. I pray that she, or he, or whatever the fuck this situation is right now, doesn't notice how fucking tense I am. That snoot gently nuzzles against my cheek, those talons and fingers slowly drifting over my back. And as she presses up against me, I become privy to a new sensation, one that's an all new level of horrifying. A gentle poke, something pressing against me at about waist height. I don't want to look down. I want to keep telling myself that I'm imagining things. But I have to. Slowly, as covertly as possible, I look down.</p><p>What.</p><p>The</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Is.</p><p>That.</p><p>My worst fears have become a reality. Right between Fang's legs, smack dab on the crotch of her pants, is a rather prominent bulge in the garment, lightly pressing against my thigh.</p><p>"Ah. S-sorry. Guess I, uhh... got a little excited."</p><p>Oh fuck she saw me looking. This is the absolute worst case scenario. I want to just curl up into a ball and die, right here and now.</p><p>"You know, Anon... I never did get a chance to properly thank you for everything you've done for me."</p><p>Oh dear god please no.</p><p>Somehow an already worst case scenario is getting even worse by the second. I feel her hand gently grasp my wrist. I'm not even sure I should still be referring to Fang as a 'her' at this point, but it's the last vestige of hope I can hold onto. Slowly, she guides my hand right to the crotch of her pants. Ordinarily this would be hot as fuck, but right now, I feel like I am about to shrivel up. She lightly presses my hand right to her crotch. Making me feel out the shape of the now all too prominent deformation in her pants. It's firm, long, with the subtlest bit of pliability to it.</p><p>I begin a mental review of my life's choices, going over the path and the various events that have lead me to this situation right now. There's no way out of this.</p><p>"I have something for you..."</p><p>Her voice dips a bit, becoming slightly more sultry. More mischievous. I can only watch with terror as her own hands slowly move to her crotch, as she pops open the button on her pants and slowly drags down the zipper with a painful, deliberate slowness. The thin black fabric of her underwear beneath is even more prominent. Oh dear god, she's fucking big. My mind races as I struggle to comprehend that my girlfriend is not only a male, but a fucking hung one as well. Dear god, this is awful.</p><p>Slowly, oh so slowly, she slips her hand down into her undergarments, and with teasing, deliberate movements, she fishes out...</p><p>A banana.</p><p>Wait, what.</p><p>"Eat up, faggot."</p><p>I'm utterly dumbstruck as Fang stuffs the phallic fruit into my gaping mouth, peel and all, the biggest shit eating grin imaginable creeping over her face, before she bursts into a violent fit of laughter, doubling over and clutching at her stomach as she stumbles away from me.</p><p>"PFFFFFFTHAHAHAHAHA! YOU REALLY THOUGHT I WAS A GUY, YOU STUPID FUCK! HAHAHAHAHAHA!"</p><p>I'm left standing there, speechless and unable to move, as my brain struggles to comprehend how badly I've just been punked. Then, a thump behind me directs my attention to the fact that Fang's howling laughter isn't the only source of laughter in the auditorium. Spinning around with the excellent source of potassium still jutting awkwardly from my lips, I see Trish balled up on the floor and partially obscured by one of the curtains on the side of the stage, her phone pointed vaguely in my direction. A high pitched, giggling laughter escapes her, interrupted by the occasional snort. Behind her, still standing and peering out from around the side of the curtain, is Reed, snickering uncontrollably to himself. Leaving Trish laughing herself into tears on the floor, he makes his way out from his hiding place and towards me. Throwing an arm around my shoulder and leaning partially against me, he speaks in that perpetually baked sounding voice of his.</p><p>"Duuuuude. You suck at gay chicken, bro."</p><p>I blink a few times, before finally regathering my senses enough to spit the banana out of my mouth.</p><p>"I hate you all so much."</p><p>Fang wraps her arms around me, pulling herself nice and close and planting a kiss right on my cheek.</p><p>"Love you too, dweeb."</p><p>I think it's safe to say she's won the prank war.</p>
