Everything goes without a hitch until they eat some of Reed's 'special' guacamole. Hilarity ensues.</p><p>​</p><p>A gift for a good artists friend of mine who helped me in a great time of need. Based this story on his hilarious image. Hope you like what I wrote, heh.</p><p>The end of the school year fast approaches, and with it, the end of an age for all involved. Life will take its course after graduation, and everyone will go their separate ways. From college, to the workforce, to places beyond Volcaldera, the future can't be more uncertain, but at the same time, can't be brighter.</p><p>Rosa knows well what was to come next. Even so, it doesn't make accepting it any easier for the pious ankylosaur. </p><p>Over the last few months, she has grown closer to some of her classmates. Each of her friends is unique in their own way. The different races and backgrounds were expected. Still, each of them brought something new to her life that, if she was honest, made her appreciate how fortunate she was to have such good fellows. So, to celebrate their friendship, Rosa called up all her friends and invited them to a garden party at her house. </p><p>Rosa's house is a few minutes outside of town. Though calling it a 'house' was an understatement. The truth is that the abode is closer to a hacienda or a rancho. It is also on the older side, built by the earliest members of Rosa's dynasty, who had lived in the area since before the days of the old west. The land covered by the house alone was half a square mile. It allowed for lots of open grass fields and a small patch of farmland that Rosa's family tended to. As a result, it gave the orange dino plenty of space to work with.</p><p>“It will be one week from today,” Rosa tells her friends, who are all listening in to a group call with her. “We’ll have musica and food and everything to make the party something that we will all remember for años to come!”</p><p>There is not one single complaint. Everyone is more than excited at the prospect of a weekend party at Rosa’s.</p><p>For the next week, Rosa spends all her time not already taken up by school or her duties as the president of the gardening club preparing for the weekend party. She bought all the party supplies she’d need on Monday. She made a list of all the ingredients she’d need to cook the many dishes she'd be prepping on Tuesdays. She asked and sourced the tables and chairs she’d use for the party from her family on Wednesday. She went out shopping with Stella and bought all the ingredients and confectionaries on Thursday. Finally, she got down to the cooking on Friday night. When Saturday morning rolls around, all she needs to do is set the tables and chairs, roll out two large speakers, and bring out the food. It takes her about two hours to set everything up. She thinks back to her family offering to help, but she instead convinced them to take the day away to enjoy their own picnic. As a result, Rosa had the house all to herself, which also means she had the entirety of the fields to herself as well.</p><p>Rosa walks around, looking over her preparation. The tables are all decorated with colorful mantles. The silverware she sourced for the party is sterling and shining. The speakers are plugged and ready to blast out tunes all day long. Finally, the food rest on chafing dishes, the disposable burners are set alight, keep the food nice and warm for the day to come.</p><p>Rosa Can't help but feel an almost overwhelming sense of accomplishment at her work. She might be a gardener at heart, but she can be a great caterer if she wants to. “¡Este es mi mejor trabajo hasta ahora!” Rosa tells herself as she puts on a broad, ear-to-ear smile.</p><p>Nothing can go wrong now. </p><p>Rosa’s phone rings. She looks down at the name on the ID and picks up after only a single ring. </p><p>“¡Hola!” Rosa exclaims jubilantly.</p><p>“We’re here!” the overly ecstatic voice of Stella, Rosa’s oldest friend, replies from the other side of the line with barely restrained enthusiasm.</p><p>“Be there in un segundo!” Rosa responds, ending the call and heading to her house with a skip to her step. </p><p>It doesn’t take long for the ankylosaur to enter her home, pass into the living room, and reach the foyer. With one final check of her outfit—her usual floral print black dress for familiarity and comfort—she reaches for her door handle and opens the door. </p><p>The moment the door swings, Rosa's greeted by a group of assorted dinos and one human, all of them her friends. Everyone is present: Anon, Fang, Stella, Reed, Trish, Naser, and Naomi.</p><p>“Amigos!” Rosa joyously exclaims, all the while opening up her arms in greeting. “Come in, come in!” she says, stepping to the side courteously.</p><p>One by one, Rosa's friends filter into the house. Each carries a piece of food or a bottle of drink with them to enjoy in their hands. </p><p>Anon and Fang carry with them some assorted bags of chips and at least five bottles of soda. Stella carries with her what looks like a medium cake decorated with white frosting and pink flourishes, forming a small five-pronged star. Trish has several boxes of assorted chocolates in her hand, as well as at least one bag of bonbons. Reed carries with him a large bowl of what looks like guacamole. Finally, Naser and Naomi hold on to covered bowls in their hands. Naser’s bowl contains what looks like homemade flan, and Naomi’s what looks to be some kind of rice pudding.</p><p>Rosa looks at all the dishes her friends brought with them and laughs. “Oh, you chicos didn’t have to bring so much food!”</p><p>“Nonsense!” Stella replies with a wide simper on her lips. “The more food we have, the merrier we’ll all be!”</p><p>The rest of Rosa's friends nod in agreement with Stella. The excitement of such an enormous feast gets everyone's mouth salivating.</p><p>Rosa doesn’t argue with Stella’s comment. In all honestly, she’s also excited about being able to let loose on all the delicious food. It isn't every day she gets to feast like royalty. If there's any time for it, it is during a garden party right before graduation rolls around.</p><p>Reed walks up to Rosa, his usual laidback smile twice as large that day. “Hey, dude. Can I like, put this in your fridge for right now?” Reed pointed to the bowl of guacamole in his hands. “Wanna save it for later today if that’s cool with you.”</p><p>"Of course!" Rosa exclaims, more than happy to do as Reed asks. She grabs the bowl and motions for everyone to follow her. She again passes by the living room and kitchen, only now with a group in tow.</p><p>"The garden's that way," Rosa points as she leaves the group and makes a detour towards the fridge. Everyone else makes their way outside while the ankylosaur stuffs Reed's bowl of avocado-based dip into her fridge. As she does, she noticed Reed giving her a thumb’s up and a broad smile before turning to walk out of the house as well.</p><p>Rosa didn't make much of her friend's gesture. She was happy she could help him in some way.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fang, Anon, Trish, Naser, Naomi, and Reed, who had just stepped outside, were awestruck by the size of Rosa’s backyard—which might as well have been a park all its own with how big it was—but also by the tables she had already set, and the food she had already prepared in expectation of all of her guests.</p><p>"So, como les guasta?" Rosa eagerly asked as she stepped out of the house and into her yard. </p><p>In reply, everyone began praising Rosa's work. The ankylosaur wasn't one to dwell on recognition much, but something about her friend's praise made her feel satisfied.</p><p>Rosa spread out her arms. "Okay, everyone, ¡Hora de comer!"   </p><p>Rosa didn't need to repeat herself. Everyone rushed to the food table and picked up one of the starling plates sourced for them. It wasn't long before the sounds of chewing and satisfied sighs started to fill the air.</p><p>While her friends helped themselves to the grub, Rosa took the opportunity to plug her phone into the speakers. With a tap on her music app, lively music began playing on the pair of large speakers. Instantly, the mood became electric. Everyone began tapping their feet and bobbing their heads in rhythm to the tunes. The music ranged from Latin upbeat pop to more contemporary songs, to even a few that were right up Fang and Trish’s respective alleys of taste.</p><p>For the second time that day, Rosa can’t help but smile ear to ear at how successful her party had was turning out.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p>By the time anyone notices the setting sun, about seven hours have passed since the party’s start. Seven hours of merriment that no one would ever forget. </p><p>As the day turned to evening, Rosa scanned the tables to take stock of how much food got eaten. Much to her surprise, the only things left were a bag of dipping chips and a bottle of soda.</p><p>Rosa can't help but giggle at how much her friends consumed. ‘And to think I was worrying that there would be leftovers,’ she told herself with a growing smirk. 'Next time, I gotta prepare even more food!'</p><p>“Hey Rosa,” Reed calls to the Aknylosaur, causing her to turn her attention back to the present. “So like, I think it’s time we had that dip I brought!”</p><p>Rosa remembered the bowl of guacamole that Reed had brought with him was still in her fridge. It was very nice and cool by now. Perfect for one final snack before ending the party.</p><p>“I’ll go get it!” Rosa chirped as she made her way back to her kitchen. Quickly finding the guacamole within her fridge, she brought out the bowl into the yard, all eyes turning towards the new food item.</p><p>“Aight, amigos,” Reed says as he pops open the last bag of chips and dips the first chip into the bowl. “Made this one really special. Hope you like it!” he says, eating his chip in its entirety, moaning in pleasure as he savors the flavors of his labor.</p><p>Not needing to hear it twice, everyone save for Rosa—who is being a polite hostess and waiting for everyone else to have their fill before eating herself—reaches for a chip and digs into the guacamole. As they take a bite and savor the flavor, the intake of chip and guacamole increases. In a matter of about five minutes, the bag of chips is almost empty, and the bowl of guacamole is roughly halfway finished. </p><p>Once again, Rosa can’t help but feel impressed with her friend’s ability to devour food so swiftly.</p><p>At last, Rosa steps forward to take chip and try out Reed’s guacamole. She picks up the largest chip that she can find, dips it into what’s left of the guacamole, and goes to take a bite... </p><p>...Only, she stops halfway when she hears what sounds like snickering. Not just any kind of snickering, though, but the type you’d only hear from two people who are really into each other.</p><p>“No, no, you’re the most precious thing to me,” Anon says as he hugs and plants a kiss on Fang’s cheek.</p><p>“What are you talking about, dweeb? YOU’RE the most precious thing to me!” Fang counters, wrapping her wings around the human and planting a big wet kiss on his cheek. Fang’s kiss seems to be some kind of unspoken gun rapport as human and ptero begin calling each other ever more lovey pet names, each one punctuated with more kisses, hugs, and giggles that only grow in intensity with each passing second. As the two lovers continue their lovey-dovey act, Rosa can't help but laugh with some. giddiness. The truth was, seeing the two lovers made her a bit jealous not to have as loving a boyfriend as Anon was to Fang. She only hopes to one day find someone as good as he was... </p><p>Another set of voices catches Rosa’s attention. This time coming from Naser and Naomi. The ankylosaur turns to face them and notices the two seemed to be talking about something or another. Despite telling herself that it was not her concern, she still paid attention to their words.</p><p>“...So yeah, I completed the 100-meter dash in less than eleven seconds! Ten and a half seconds, to be accurate!” Naser boasted as he put a hand on his chest.</p><p>Naomi put her hands together and gave her boyfriend a smile, one Rosa can't help but feel is very disingenuous. “Oh really? Because last I checked, your actual time was closer to eleven seconds!”</p><p>Naser let out a hurt scoff, physically recoiling as if he had gotten struck by some invisible hand. “Excuse you!?” he snaps, pointing a finger at Naomi. “You’re wrong about that! My time was ten and a half seconds! Fastest in the entire school!”</p><p>Naomi gives Naser a narrowed-eyed smile. “Oh? Are you sure you’re not misremembering? Because I clearly remember your time being closer to eleven seconds and not ten and a half!”</p><p>“You really think I wouldn’t remember breaking my school record?” Nasser shouts back.</p><p>Naomi gives her boyfriend a devilish grin as she adjusts her glasses so that they seem to glow white for the faintest of seconds.</p><p>Rosa, all of a sudden, got a bad feeling about where the conversation was heading. Putting the dipped chip down on a nearby plate, she starts making her way towards the arguing couple. She doesn't make it far as her attention is again pulled away by another loud noise, this time a scream. </p><p>Rosa, as well as everyone else, turns to face the source of the outcry. To Rosa’s dismay, the originator of the sound was none other than Stella. Only seconds after screaming, she started dashing around the yard with her hands trailing behind her back, all the while emitting a high-pitched screech that sounds less like she's trying to perform a war cry and more like she's getting badly strangled by an armless quadriplegic. </p><p>Rosa scowls and gets ready to go and try to snap Stella out of whatever had gotten into her head, only to stop when everyone around her began to cheer Stella on, clapping at her display of incredible stupidity and immaturity.</p><p>Rosa’s brain stops for a second as it tries to process what was happening before her. ‘How can they be clapping at that!?’ she asks herself in a stupor. She had half a mind to bust out a chancla and smack some sense into the girl.</p><p>Whatever thoughts Rosa had at that moment are completely uprooted when, to her horror—yet to the delight of her friends—Stella strips off all her clothes save for her bra and panties, and begins to run around the backyard, all the while flailing her limbs like she no longer had a single care in the world.</p><p>“YEAHHHH!!!!” Stella shouts at the top of her lungs, all the while striking various strange poses that Rosa had no natural frame of reference for. “I’m the next Pirate King, Hokage, AND the Queen of Games!!!!” With another shout, one somehow louder than the last, Stella strips the last of her clothing, leaving her in her birthday suit. She runs further away from the party, all the while performing cartwheels, rolling around on the grass like she's some kind of balled-up hedgehog, and doing what can only be described as ‘fashion posing’ in extremely flamboyant ways. </p><p>Stella’s sudden turn towards exhibitionism seems to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. An endless amount of cheering from everyone present, save for Rosa, follows. Rosa, meanwhile, instead looks like she is witnessing a trainwreck in real-time. Before she can finish processing the image of her best friend running around naked and shouting what to her sounds like nonsensical Japanese gibberish, the rest of her friends break out into their respective forms of chaotic behavior, all of them taking Stella’s act as the cue to let go of whatever inhibitors they still had left.</p><p>Rosa hears a loud thud. She turns around in time to see Fang sitting on top of one of her tables, making out with Anon. The two moan and practically french each other without any regard about who was watching them. If anything, being watched seems to embolden them, making them go at each other’s mouth all the harder, to the point that the ankylosaur swore they are trying to eat each other.</p><p>“¿¡Qué están haciendo!?” Rosa shouts, her cheeks growing bright and red hot as she covers her eyes in an attempt at keeping her catholic eyes virgin pure.</p><p>Neither Anon nor Fang pays Rosa any attention as Anon climbs on top of the table and falls right upon Fang, who in turn wraps Anon in her wings and cradles him in a cocoon of gray feathers as their kissing slowly begins to turn into something far more riske.</p><p>Rosa starts fuming in rage at her friend’s display of lewd affection. She turns around in time to see Naomi and Naser pressing their foreheads to each other.</p><p>“No, I’m telling you, I really did run a full mile in under five minutes!” Naser shouts into Naomi’s face.</p><p>“Liar! If you ran it that fast, you’d be on pace for some kind of world record!” Naomi snaps right back at Naser’s face. “Besides, I can run a mile in five minutes even, and that’s on the records!”</p><p>“Are you saying you don’t believe that I can run a mile under that time!?”</p><p>“I’m saying that unless I see it, I WON’T believe you!”</p><p>Naser takes a step back, his mouth agape and his eyes wide in what can be best described as ‘abject horror.’ Meanwhile, Naomi sports a look of smug victory, as if the dino was 100% convinced that she was in the absolute right and that nothing her boyfriend could do would prove her otherwise.</p><p>“Oh. Oh! It’s on now!” Naser said as he removed his trademark jacket and unbuttoned his black long sleeve shirt. He tossed both garments aside with a great deal of flourish as he puffed out his now bare, well-toned, and chiseled chest and shot a self-righteous grin towards Naomi. “I’m about to prove to you just how wrong you are!”</p><p>“Oh no, you are not!” Naomi countered, also removing her shirt and leaving her wearing what looked like a sports bra. “I’m about to prove to YOU just how wrong you are!”</p><p>The couple crouch down in preparation. After the two take deep breaths, they take off sprinting. Their feet dig into the grass and propel them forward with such speed and ferocity that the two almost become blurs in the distance.</p><p>Rosa’s too occupied trying to make sense of Naser and Naomi’s ‘competition’ to notice Trish fiddling with her speakers. By the time she notices her friend, Trish has already plugged her phone into the master speaker and was standing on top of it. She removes her trademark yellow hoodie and holds it in her hand, leaving her wearing only a tiny black tank top that did her no favor in hiding her enormous breasts.</p><p>“And now I will dance the song of my people!” the triceratops shouts at the top of her lungs as she taps on her phone and drops it right next to the speaker. Soon as she does, the song ‘Walk the Dinosaur’ begins blaring at a volume that can't be healthy for normal hearing. As the song hits its first major crescendo, Trish spins her hoodie over her head, all the while swinging her body side to side. When the chorus kicked in, she then dropped into a low crouch and begins twerking her ass in rhythm to the music, all the while hollering and making what almost sounds like money noises.</p><p>Rosa’s left eye twitches in rage as she witnesses the display of mild specieism from her triceratops friend. Her anger only intensifies when she hears cheering. She snaps her head to the right and sets a glare on Reed, who seems to be the only other person aside from her who hasn’t fallen into some kind of debaucherous spell. Instead, he only sits back on a chair with a cup of soda in one hand, a small bowl of his guacamole in the other, and a wide goofy grin on his lips.</p><p>Rosa’s eyes snap wide. She marches up to the nacho chip she put aside earlier. ‘Everyone started going Loco en el coco after they ate Reed’s dip,’ she reasons as she picks up the chip and takes a small bite out of the chip in her hand. </p><p>At first, she’s floored by how delicious it is. Sour, yet savory, spicy, yet also sweet. The flavors mixed in so perfectly that Rosa’s very much tempted to pick up another chip and have herself another bite. Using the self-restrained taught to her by her catholic faith, she stops herself and instead tastes the guacamole; she REALLY tastes it, swishing the flavor in her mouth and savoring even the tiniest of sensations her tongue.</p><p>That's when she tastes something else mixed into the guacamole, something that isn't avocado or tomato or onion or spice or lime juice. Something that can't be natural in the conventional sense of the word. Something that makes the most instinctual of parts of her brain demand more and more...</p><p>She spits out the contents of her mouth before they could further cloud her judgment and turns to face Reed, who is still cheering Trish on as she continued her decadent dance on top of the speaker. </p><p>“Reed, what did you put in the guacamole?” Rosa asks as she holds the half-eaten chip dipped in the sauce in front of the pink stoner.</p><p>Reed scratched his head and raised an eyebrow, almost as if he was trying to be reflective about the question. “Guacamole...?” he asks innocently enough. Still, it’s clear that he, too, doesn’t quite know how to answer Rosa’s question, even if he was the one to make the dip that had sent everyone over into la-la land.</p><p>Rosa crushed the chip in her hand as her face turned a deep shade of crimson. She once more began fuming, steam leaving her nostrils as anger started taking her over. In a moment of uncharacteristic rage, the orange ankylosaur raised her first and punched Reed square in the face, sending him sprawling into the floor. She wanted so bad to turn that anger on the rest of her friends next, but temperance once more returned to Rosa as she tried calming herself down with deep breaths. She looks down at Reed, ready to utter an apology for her sudden blow, but Reed’s eyes spun in place as a wide goofy grin formed on his lips. “Oh, look at all the pretty stars! Weeee!” he said to himself in a plain stupor.</p><p>Rosa gives up on that idea with a sigh and instead turns to face her friend’s shenanigans. She pondered how to best get them all back under control. ‘They are naughty cabrones, and the only way to control cabrones is…”</p><p>Rosa grimaces and turns away from her friends to face her house. Without another word, she marches back inside, past her living room, and towards her room. </p><p>“Tiempos desesperados requieren masuras desesperadas,” Rosa tells herself as she approaches her room. “Never thought I’d have to resort to using ‘it,’” she says ominously as she pushes her door open and walks up to her closet. She slides the doors open and pulls out a heavy metallic briefcase with a combination lock. She next walks up to a nearby wall, upon which is a painting of her Mother Mary. She grabs one of the corners of the painting. She pulls on it, causing it to slide to the right side, revealing a neat hole upon which is a glass box labeled ‘En caso de demonios, hereticos, y idiotas corriendo en tu casa, rompe el vidrio.’</p><p>Rosa breaks the glass with her bare fists without hesitation and reaches inside. There, she pulls a piece of ornate paper with the numbers ‘737’ written in fancy calligraphy.</p><p>With a nod, she walks back to the briefcase and pops the numbers into the tumbler combination, at which point the latches spring up. She grabs the lid and, with another sigh, pops open the briefcase.</p><p>There is a hiss as the lid rises. A bright golden light bathes Rosa’s face as a few clouds of fog leave the box. Performing a sign of the cross on herself, Rosa reaches into the case and, with all the reverence that she can muster, grasps the item within.</p><p>“El arma para superar todas las otras armas,” Rosa whispers in an awestruck tone as he pulls out a golden-colored sandal with ornate ribbons, a silver rosary tied around the front and trailing behind like some kind of flowing flourish, and a glow that bordered on the supernatural. On top was the embroiled image of none other than Raptor Jesus, his brow set to a crease and his arms crossed in obvious disappointment.</p><p>With a grim expression on her face, Rosa smacks the sandal on her hand, which emits a small flash of light and a thunderous, echoing sound. She turns her attention back to her yard from out of her room’s window. There, she can see her friend’s still acting like a bunch of idiots. Fang and Anon were now actively trying to remove each other’s clothes. Naser and Naomi continued running around the yard while still locked in their argument. Trish continued to dance on top of the speaker, her pants now removed, leaving her only wearing her tank top and panties. Stella was trying to wrestle a tree in the distance, and reed was still lying on the grass, looking like he had a run-in with a pro boxer.</p><p>Knowing what she needs to do, Rosa closes the briefcase and grips the sandal on her hand tighter. Without another word, she steps out of her room and towards the backyard, all the while brandishing her holy chancla with equal parts reverence and harmful intent...</p></div>
