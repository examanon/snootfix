                    <p>Title: The Spirit Is Willing</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Naser</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>Summary: Fang takes care of anon after a particularly strenuous night</p><p>â€‹</p><p>No matter how much I tried I couldn't escape it. The morning sun was determined to shine onto my closed eyes and force me to wake up. I finally give in and open my eyes. Slowly I get my bearings. A few birds are chirping outside, the open window is letting in a cool breeze, and instead of a blanket, I have a wing draped over my body. The warm Volcaldera summer made anything besides bed sheets pointless. Over the weeks it pretty much forced us to get rid of the bed cover and most of our clothes. Either that or you accepted you were waking up drenched with sweat. I was down to just a pair of boxer shorts, while Fang decided to get rid of everything entirely.</p><p>Taking a glance at the bedside alarm, I saw the digital face informing me it was a little over nine. The solar spotlight has made its way to Fang, causing her to start stirring. Beginning her own futile struggle, she buries her face into my sides while also pulling herself closer. Caressing her back I watch the sunlight creep ever closer to her face. A few minutes is all that it takes for nature to disturb Fangs' sleep once again. This time she accepts her fate and starts waking up.</p><p>Blinking away the last few strands of sleep, she looks up to me with half-closed eyes, a smile creeping on her face.</p><p>"Mornin'"</p><p>"Morning, sleep well?"</p><p>"I could do with some more if it wasn't for this sun making it hard."</p><p>"It is a quarter past nine"</p><p>Fang lets out a long groan as she tries to accept the fact that it's time to wake up. My hand made its way down to Fangs' tail. A light brush against it makes it wag rapidly for a few seconds. The ptero lets out a small giggle, before giving me a certain look.</p><p>"I guess we have some time."</p><p>Fang pushes against the mattress, propelling her body on top of mine. Instead of the familiar feel of her soft scales, I only feel pain. Tears instantly start stinging my eyes and I let out a whimper.</p><p>"Oh you big baby, you weren't whining last night."</p><p>As Fang adjusts her body I can't help but let out another sob. I can feel the elastic of my boxers stretching for a moment before abruptly snapping back. Can't help but wonder if this is some sort of fucked up nightmare my brain conjured up.</p><p>As the sting from the elastic band slowly subsides I notice Fang is not on top of me anymore. Instead, I hear rummaging in the bathroom, followed by rapid footsteps. Fang rushes back into the bedroom holding a towel, an ice pack, and a tube of some sort of cream. She tosses what she's carrying onto the bed and proceeds to yank off my boxer shorts. I look up at her, seeing her more than a little worried.</p><p>"What the hell happened Anon?! You look like you lost a fight with another bollard."</p><p>Propping myself against the mattress I look at what's causing Fang so much worry. Looking at my entire groin and pelvic area being covered in bruises made it obvious her concern was justified. Fang proceeds to wrap the ice pack in a towel before gently placing it on my bruises. Stinging at first, the radiating cold soon becomes a welcome relief. The ice pack doing its thing, Fang sits next to me on the bed.</p><p>"Well? What do you have to say for yourself?"</p><p>"What? I didn't do anything. Not like I could with how exhausted I was."</p><p>Fang stares off into the distance, trying to figure out the reason for my unexplained bruising. Suddenly realization hits and her cheeks get a light dusting of pink.</p><p>"Anon, you don't think it was from..."</p><p>As Fangs' face was getting redder by the second I glance down at my bruises and back to her a few times before finally figuring out what she's implying.</p><p>"Well, it does seem the most likely explanation."</p><p>Suddenly Fangs' expression turns from embarrassment to anger. She smacks my chest with one hand just enough for it to sting a bit.</p><p>"Why the fuck didn't you say anything if I was hurting you?"</p><p>A smarter man would have picked his words more carefully at this point.</p><p>"I mean, I wasn't exactly in pain then."</p><p>Fangs' anger is washed away and replaced by a mixture of annoyance and some other emotion. I could have sworn I saw a smirk on her snoot.</p><p>"Anon, I swear to god..."</p><p>As her voice trails off Fang removes the ice pack and starts applying cream to my battered body. The cooling effect and Fangs' gentle massage were doing wonders. Satisfied, the ptero leaves to put the ice pack back into the freezer. I pull up my boxers so I don't have to look at my battered groin longer than I have to. Trying my hardest to wrap my head around the whole situation, I don't make much progress before Fang returns. I can't help but notice she's laughing to herself.</p><p>"What's so funny?"</p><p>"I'm sorry, I just can't believe you..."</p><p>Fang can't finish her sentence before succumbing to the laughter she was desperately trying to suppress.</p><p>"I know I shouldn't laugh. But after all that bragging that you'd make sure I couldn't walk straight," Fang wipes away a tear before continuing, "looks like that didn't go exactly as planned."</p><p>Laying on the bed I can only hope I sink into the mattress to escape the shame.</p><p>Before the bed shows pity on me and swallows me whole, Fang grabs me by the hand and pulls me up into a sitting position.</p><p>"Come on, let's get you something to eat."</p><p>I was expecting Fang to just help me stand up, but instead, she puts one hand under my knees and the other behind my back. As she lifts me up I can't help but let out a small yelp before grabbing onto her for fear of falling down. For her part, Fang isn't even exerting herself that much as she carries me to the living room. The time spent at the gym with Trish was already paying dividends. Gently lowering me down onto the couch I can't help but regret the bedroom and living room being so close together.</p><p>"Don't worry, I'll take care of you, 'squishy'." Fang can't help but giggle as she sees a blush creep across my face. "Just so you know, I'm going to make you squirm one way or another." With a final flick of her tongue over the tip of my nose Fang makes her way to the kitchen, while I'm left wondering just how much worse the day will get. My body will heal, but the beating my ego is taking is an entirely different story.</p><p>The kitchen is suspiciously quiet, I lean as far back as the couch would let me to see what my ptero wife is up to. I saw she put on something to cover up her modesty, even if it was only her favorite apron with 'kiss the cook' embroidered onto it. Fang is leaning against the counter fiddling with her phone as something sizzles in the pan she has on the stove. Surely she isn't texting anyone about what happened. My fears prove to be without merit as within seconds a song starts playing from her phone's speaker and she puts it down on the counter. Fang turns her attention back to the stove, her tail wagging to the beat of the song. Sensing she's being watched Fang turns around, locking eyes with me. It lasts only for a moment, but she knew I was staring at her. She gives me a smile and a quick shake of her rump before returning to her task.</p><p>While I spend several minutes cursing my weak body, Fang brings breakfast for both of us. Like a doting housewife, she lays the plate before me, a pair of sunny-side-up eggs with some dino nuggets forming a makeshift smile and nose, along with a glass of orange juice. Moments later she throws herself onto the couch, one leg on top of the back of the couch, the other dangling freely. Surprisingly, she's still wearing the apron. I start eating breakfast before Fang figures out what exactly I'm drooling over. Fang is eating her own egg/nugget combo, although with far less gusto than usual. She gives me a worried look.</p><p>"Anon, are you sure you're OK? Maybe we should go to a doctor after you finish eating."</p><p>"It's just a few bruises, I've lived through worse. You should know, with being there and all." Fangs' worried expression persisted. "I'm fine. Besides, the only thing the doctor will do is give me a thumbs up when he sees where my bruises are and who my wife is." Finally, her worry melts away from the rising heat in her cheeks.</p><p>"Anon, you ass..." is all she could say as she picks up the dirty dishes and heads to the kitchen.</p><p>Since there isn't anything useful I can do today, I decide to pick up my xrox controller for a few rounds of rock ring. Fang returns before the console even finishes its long bootup sequence. Ditching her apron, she's back in her birthday suit.</p><p>The ptero sits down next to me and I can't help but ask, "So, uh, no clothes today?"</p><p>"Nah," before I can continue Fang snatches the controller out of my hands, "Too sick for sex, too sick for video games."</p><p>I'm about to protest about her definition of sick, but my attention is pulled to the screen. Instead of shutting off the console, Fang is selecting a game to play.</p><p>"So, you're going to play?"</p><p>"Sure, why not?" Fang makes herself comfortable in the corner of the couch, her wings draped over the back of it, "Used to play this one with Naser way back when." The title 'Rock Ring: Clubbing Evolved' fills the screen and the menu music fills me with nostalgia. I scoot closer to Fang as she makes her way through the menu. I put my arms around her waist, and for a moment think about resting my head on her boob, before choosing her shoulder instead. As much as I wanted to, it would have ruined the moment. Fang for her part remains focused on the game, but eventually brings down one of her wings as a makeshift blanket. Man, this is comfy as shit, no wonder Fang watches me play all the time. We stay like this for a good while, with Fang swatting my hand if it wanders too close to her nether region.</p><p>Which makes me wonder, "Sweet tooth, you feeling OK?"</p><p>For just a moment she is embarrassed by the pet name before replying, "Sure, why wouldn't I be?"</p><p>"I mean, aren't you even a little bit, "I pause to clear my throat, not exactly sure how to say this, "You know, sore?"</p><p>Fang pauses the game and stands up, leaving me without my ptero blanket and cushion. Moving exaggeratedly, she 'examines" herself by nearly showing her crotch in my face several times.</p><p>"I feel fine." She takes a step back and does a standing split right then and there. "Nope, nothing hurts. Must be those extraordinary genes doctors keep telling me about."</p><p>"You're enjoying this, aren't you?"</p><p>"What was that, squishy?"</p><p>"N-nothing. Think you can get me another ice pack?"</p><p>"Of course, but first we have to take you back to bed."</p><p>Same as the last time, Fang picks me up and carries me to the bed. Although this time her pace is somewhat slower, and she wraps her wings around me as she carries me. The way she lowered me down and applied the cream again was beyond gentle. Hopefully, she isn't still blaming herself for what happened. Satisfied with her work, Fang momentarily leaves the bedroom. After pulling my boxers back on, but before I pull myself up to the pillow, Fang returns with a guitar. She gets on the bed so that her back is against the headboard. Fang begins playing a song, but from the missed notes, it's clear something is bothering her.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"Just thinking," Fang lets out a sigh, "You know I'd never intentionally hurt you, right?"</p><p>"Of course," I scoot closer to her, "It's just a few bruises, they'll be gone before you know it."</p><p>"Yeah, but if you got bruised this easily, how are you going to survive estrus week?" Fang puts the guitar down before continuing. "I'm just worried I won't be able to restrain myself and you'll end up with more than just a few bruises." I'm trying to think of a way to console her, but the fact that last night was supposed to be her exercising restraint gets stuck in my head.</p><p>"That was restraint?"</p><p>"Mmhmm. I really want to spend the entire estrus week with you, but not if I put you in a hospital." She lets out a deep breath, "I also don't want to spend the entire week locked in my room again."</p><p>I grab her hand to make her snap out of it, "Hey, don't worry, we'll figure something out." I give her a light squeeze which does make Fang smile a little bit. "Besides, I'm not getting hospitalized over a few bruises."</p><p>"Oh, it's not just bruising. It's bites, scratches, dehydration, extreme exhaustion, and so on."</p><p>"Now you're just messing with me."</p><p>Fang gives me an annoyed look, "Why do you think you get two weeks off if your wife's estrus only lasts one week?"</p><p>I hadn't considered that. Still, last night was restraint?</p><p>Fang suddenly grabs her phone, "I'll call Naser, maybe he knows of some drug to help you out."</p><p>"Wait, what? Why your brother?"</p><p>"Why not? He graduated top of his class, if anyone knows his shit it's him."</p><p>"But, does he really need to know about what happened?</p><p>"Don't worry, I'll try to keep it sparse with the details. Then again I might have to, he is kind of dense sometimes."</p><p>Fang selects the dial command, puts the call on speaker, and tosses the phone on the bed between us. As we listen to the dial tone, Fang hugs her knees and brings them up to her chest. Finally, Naser picks up.</p><p>"Fang? What's up?"</p><p>Fang does her best to sound casual but completely fails at the attempt, "Hey Steven Fucked-wing. Got a minute?"</p><p>"Uh, sure. What's up?"</p><p>"Well...", unable to explain how she turned the area around my dick into the color of a blueberry Fang starts waving her arms at me to come up with something. Before I can even begin thinking of any euphemism, Naser speaks up, clearly worried.</p><p>"Oh god, are you OK, Fang? Did something happen?" Nasers voice changes from worried, to panicked, to angry in a single second. "Did Anon hurt you? I swear to raptor Jesus if he laid a finger on you I'll..."</p><p>Fang interjects before Naser can continue spelling out what he'd do to me if I ever harmed his sister.</p><p>"Stop freaking out dipshit! I'm perfectly fine." Still unable to spell it out for Naser, Fang continues, "It's Anon."</p><p>"Fang, what did you do?"</p><p>"I got a bit carried away and..."</p><p>"Fang, is my brother-in-law OK?</p><p>"Jesus fuck, he's fine. Why do you keep jumping to conclusions?"</p><p>There is a short pause, during which I can only imagine Naser pinching the bridge of his snoot in frustration.</p><p>"Sorry. It's just the way you're dancing around whatever the fuck is going on, it's not like you."</p><p>Fang looks at me, "I'm gonna tell him."</p><p>I put on my best begging face, "Fang. Please."</p><p>"Listen one-winged wonder, anons crotch is all bruised from, uh, late-night wrestling." Fang just looks down at the bed, hoping to get through the awkwardness as fast as possible. "I'm really worried he won't make it through estrus week without a trip to the ER. You got any pills or shit that can help him out?"</p><p>There is no response for several seconds. The call is still active and I can't help but let out a groan. Fang is starting to get worried she caused her brother to die from cringe.</p><p>"Naser?"</p><p>"I didn't need to know that sis," Naser lets out a long, frustrated sigh, "Was it too hard to call your doctor or something? I really don't need to know how hard you two go at it. God damn."</p><p>"Deal with it. Now spit out what the pills are called before I start going into excruciating detail on how I rock my husband's world."</p><p>Good god, I hope she's bluffing.</p><p>"How the fuck should I know? I'm not that kind of doctor. Just tell the pharmacist you need something for a human to survive estrus week. Ask for max strength."</p><p>Hope returned to Fang. Finally, she'll be able to fuck my brains out without sending me to an early grave.</p><p>"Look, if there's nothing else I'm gonna hang up, and hopefully forget this conversation ever happened."</p><p>"Bye, Harwing De-," Naser hangs up before Fang can finish saying one of the oh-so-many nicknames she has for her brother.</p><p>I look up at Fang who is finally calm again, "So, what now?"</p><p>"Nothing, the pharmacy is closed until Monday."</p><p>"I mean, what do you want to do next."</p><p>"Well," Fang flops down on the tummy, her face next to mine, "I can continue teasing you like I've done the whole day." I do love it when she does that, but usually, I can act on my desires when she does that.</p><p>"Or we can just cuddle for a bit. Your choice." I put my hands around my ptero wife and pull her close.</p><p>"Cuddling it is. But you're the little spoon again." Fang twists me around so she's pressed against my back and rests her snoot against my face. Unsurprisingly her hands travel down south forcing me to let out a hissing noise when she reaches a particularly painful bruise.</p><p>"Fine, we'll stick to cuddling: classic for a while. Gonna have to wait for the deluxe version to come back into stock."</p>
