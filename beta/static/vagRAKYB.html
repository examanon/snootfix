                    <p>Title: An Interesting Uncle</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Trish, Spears</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>Just laying on my bed listening to some music   “But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me</p><p>I'm the epitome of public enemy” waiting for my shitpost about how the stream dic has no games  when I was interrupted by phone notification,  a text from a unknown number </p><p>hey anon it’s Tobias Rieper heard you need a suit for prom I can help you out with that, I’l be there in 10 minutes </p><p>it was ol mysterious uncle toby again, only ever say him at him occasionally at Christmas and easter but I did remember him cause he gave me 500$ every time, very useful for bowing it all on bionicles and bay blades. </p><p>got my jacket and shoes on and make my way down the stairs, and he pulled up right to the lobby door, his car was just like the one in the matrix long black and glossy, as I stepped in to it the I was overcome the smell of leather polish and vinyl, it was immaculate clean inside looked brand new,  we drove on in silence for a while, distracting myself by reading all the replies to my post only with the only sound being the quit hum of classical music coming from the radio, toby interrupted the silence by introjecting  “so   anon how is your education going?”  bit startled I replied “oh it’s uh going uh good yeah yeah” satisfied with the answer, we drove on 2 towns over, finally slowing down in the run down part of town</p><p>finally stopping in front of the store “Tommy’s Tailors”</p><p>as we both walked through the door tommy welcomed us in saying “what a pleasure it is too meet again 47 how may I help you today?”</p><p>47? What the hell what kind of stupid name is that, must be a German name banking thing from Milton Fitzpatrick I guess.</p><p>47 said “I need a suit for my nephew” tommy replied “sure thing lets get started”</p><p>the walls were lined with suits, the nice ones you only ever see in those perfume ads, far too nice for someone like me would ever need</p><p>after what seemed like forever with being measured with a tape it was finally over  </p><p>he dropped me off and I made my way back inside </p><p>a few days later a knock at my door came and left a box at my door, and inside was the suit immaculate suit the nicest one I’d ever seen fitted cotton shirt, padded insoles, blood red tie, black gloves and matching a a cuff links. It was even nicer than the one Naser has </p><p>and on the day of the prom 47 dropped me off at the front of the school and walked the way up the steps and saw the whole gang up there and I over heard Naser saying “anon will never be drip, his broke ass suit from Walmart”, then finally turning to see me Naser stood there agist “anon is fucking drip” “well thank you” </p><p>I replied then unfortunately for myself the next thing I said when I saw trish standing there was blurting out “wass goood myy trigger” then presided to reee at me with extreme intensity and proceeded to punch me, time stood still my whole life flashed before my eyes, that’s a lot of shitposting and jerking off, an abnormal amount of times, maybe I need to reconsider my life a little bit, but right now I need to refocus on the incoming punch that’s about to deck my ass, </p><p>but just before it made contact with my face 47 showed up out of no where to intercept it. Trish shocked stood back and slowly walked away but not before 47 took his briefcase and chucked it like an axe at trishe’s face it seemed to have a supernatural tracking ability and it keep going after her just going on and on in awe of what just happened, we just walked in silence, then 47 proceeded to shimmy up the water gutter pipe into the second story window jumping in avoiding all the security cameras, making it to the security room and successfully disconnecting it, slowly making his way to the principles office, Spears was just taking a break from the festivities by watching lucky star on his small room tv, 47 got him to stand up and walk over to the tossed soda can 47 threw, and before he know it 47 was chocking the brute out, even through Spears tried he was no match for 47, before he left he looked at the computer logged on the to the grading system changed anon’s c average to a b+ and tanked trish’s average to a d-,</p><p>then he proceeded to take the suit and dump the body in the near by gym locker, entering the gym no one seemed the wiser seems like all it takes is just the clothes and the glasses and no one will notice, he walked towards the other side towards anon yelling over the music “how are you enjoying your prom so far anon?” anon in disbelief in what he was seeing before him just said “good yeah” then 47 left to walk over too rosa too woo her in Spanish </p>
