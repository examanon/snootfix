Well worth splurging his navy stipend</p><p>>Months behind on rent, he finally gets kicked out after selling practically everything he owns to delay the inevitable</p><p>>Only one thing left for him then, Anon becomes homeless</p><p>>Busks for money with a beat up guitar he found in a dumpster</p><p>>Gets decently good at it. No-one is going to feed a shit performer with anything but knuckle sandwiches</p><p>>One day, some guy sticks around, offers Anon a deal. Join in with his band for guaranteed income</p><p>>Band already has a few members. Could just use a 2nd guitar to round out the ensemble</p><p>>Anon agrees, arriving early on the first day of practice</p><p>>Some band members are late, so Anon just gets to showing off what he can do with the rest of them</p><p>>Everything is going well until the final band member comes in</p><p>>That voice is sure familiar</p><p>>Anon turns around to see Fang</p><p>>She hasn't seen him yet</p><p>>He grabs the closest thing to him, the unattached bell of a marching band tuba</p><p>>He then shoves it over his head, obscuring his face</p><p>>Band members have no idea what's going on</p><p>>There isn't even a tuba player in the band where did that bell come from?</p><p>>Anon replies that he plays better when he can't see</p><p>>They somehow roll with it. Good thing there's no sheet music for their songs. Anon gets invited to the next practice</p><p>>Next time around he just comes in with a paper bag with GUNDAM written on it in permanent marker</p><p>>One day is worse than the others</p><p>>Fang can't quite hold it together</p><p>>Band leader rips the bag off Anon's paper-bag-face to give to Fang for hyperventilation treatment</p><p>>No tuba around this time. The band has been especially on watch since the incident where Anon appeared to have pulled one out of thin air</p><p>>I mean shit those go for hundreds of dollars. Easy money if one shows up again</p><p>>God damnit, Fang is recovering faster than expected</p><p>>Anon sees his only redemption</p><p>>One silent prayer to Raptor Jesus later, he pretends to trip and impales his head through a snare drum</p><p>>Not too bad this time. He can almost see the fuzzy shadows of the band members through the drum skin</p><p>>Anon is disappointed that he won't be able to quote Batdino anymore. His darkness was taken from him</p><p>>He's made enough money to replace the drum at this point at least</p><p>>The band leader isn't too impressed though, but since Anon paid for it, it's his hat now</p><p>>They just call him Drumstick from then on</p><p>>Good thing too, since Anon was vetoing requests for his name and "Skinny" had worn itself thin</p><p>>Band is actually doing well now. It's been invited to a good amount of medium profile gigs</p><p>>Anon's image has been going around pretty well too</p><p>>I guess Daft Grunk isn't too bad a moniker </p><p>>Even got one of the band members to stencil a face onto it while he was wearing it</p><p>>The acetone-smell hasn't quite vanished from the inside of it though</p><p>>He swears he can feel the bassist getting closer to him at every event they play at</p><p>>Can't tell for sure though, black stencil is probably not a good idea for visibility</p><p>>One day some rhinorex comes in to talk to the band leader</p><p>>By the way his shadow is moving, Anon can tell that something big is happening</p><p>>He finally comes over to make the announcement</p><p>>They've been invited to the big leagues</p><p>>Stickstock 201M2025 BC</p><p>>The event is enormous.</p><p>>Anon gets lost multiple times, but he can't take off his headpiece</p><p>>No way can he afford to let his adoring fans be crushed by just how plain he is</p><p>>Not to mention the shot of courage that this fleeting form of anonimity gives him</p><p>>God damn though, those burgers smell delicious. He only knew of one guy who can eat food through a mask and he lost contact with him ages ago</p><p>>One of his band members finally decides to help him navigate</p><p>>They're really quiet though, Anon can't tell if his smalltalk is even being answered over the din of all the people and sound equipment</p><p>>Oh well. Doesn't matter. He can ask later</p><p>>Eventually he finds himself in a nice chair with arm and leg rests, his guitar having been thrown onto his lap moments after sitting down</p><p>>One of the band members snidely remarks that the chair is absolutely perfect for Anon</p><p>>Anon can't figure it out though, a chair is a chair right?</p><p>>Maybe it's just nerves. There's a lot of anxious energy floating around as everyone checks their equipment and makes certain that nothing bad can possibly happen</p><p>>I mean, you wouldn't want a string on your guitar to snap right before a performance</p><p>>The shadow of the rhinorex agent casts over the skin of Anon's drum-hat</p><p>>He lets the band know that they'll be on next, and to get everything set up</p><p>>Anon suddenly finds himself moving. An automatic-drive chair? Holy shit how expensive is this thing? Must have gotten comped by the sponsors</p><p>>He hopes the AI is better than what he remembers of those car autopilots. He seriously doubts the companies claims that it doesn't specifically target skinnies</p><p>>His joyride finally ends, as Anon finds himself on what he can only conclude is his spot on stage</p><p>>The lights flash on</p><p>>Anon can only be grateful that he cannot see the audience at all thanks to his helmet</p><p>>He can certainly hear their cheering however. Over and over again they call out the name of the band</p><p>>It's a bit muffled though. Really should have considered carving some ear-holes. He can't quite make it out.</p><p>>Anon is surprised at the reception. All those hours lounging away on his favourite lithography carving meet-up didn't show any signs of his band</p><p>>I guess it isn't obscure or counterculture enough. Those fuckers. He'd get them later</p><p>>Anon sees a shadow move forward, and a voice cracks through the speakers</p><p>>"THANK YOU STICKSTOCK! WE GIVE YOU, VVURM DRAMA!"</p><p>>An amused hum leaves Anon, Fang must have more input on the band than he thought.</p><p>>Anon's thoughts are quickly interrupted as the band's drummer counts them in</p><p>>Speakers call out as the band enters their musical set, the audience responding back with yet more cheering</p><p>>Lightning fast fingers go through the motions, Anon's blind practice showing through as he played his parts to perfection</p><p>>Take that Rockki Hendrix</p><p>>Can't quite lift the guitar behind his back while playing though. Maybe if he ever takes off the drum-helmet</p><p>>Song after song gets played, the mania of the crowd becoming ever more potent with each passing minute</p><p>>If their set was infinite, Anon felt like he could play forever. His aching sweating body being no contest towards the absolute euphoria he was undergoing</p><p>>But as the last song of their set finished, Anon accepted the inevitable. The crowd's response surely had guaranteed their return to big leagues</p><p>>Anon set his guitar back on his lap, signaling to the audience with devil horns on his pumped out hand</p><p>>But, the cheering died down. What? What's going on?</p><p>>Isn't the band leader supposed to close them out? Where is he at?</p><p>>The lights dim a touch, as another shadow comes up to where the microphone stands</p><p>>Geeze, about time</p><p>>A guitar sings out once more, testing chords. Anon surmises that whoever is playing must be really nervous</p><p>>Ah fuck. The band must have managed to forget about him in their own euphoria before they left the stage. How much time passed? Did someone spike the water?</p><p>>Maybe he should just play along with these next guys. He did tell himself he wanted to play more didn't he?</p><p>>Anon gets his guitar into position once more. All he needs to hear is some chord progression before he jumps in with his own improv</p><p>>He follows the lead guitar, call and response, call and response</p><p>>Once more, the stage lights blaze on, their spotlights panning toward both the guitar out front and himself</p><p>>The silhouette of the lead guitar imprints itself onto the drumskin of Anon's helmet</p><p>>Those wings, time and despair marking them, spanning across the entirety of his vision</p><p>>It's Fang</p><p>>In that moment, Anon can only let his heart and fingers guide him.</p><p>>That song, made together at what seemed a lifetime ago on a roof, tempered by life experiences, sprang forth from the both of them</p><p>>It was this song that Anon believes had saved his life. It was what he played when life was at its lowest</p><p>>It was even what he had been playing that day he was first found and inducted into the band</p><p>>But, he never finished the song. Its parts were all in shattered pieces at best</p><p>>And yet, when his song sputters out in unknown waters, Fang's guiding harmony is there to stop Anon from drowning</p><p>>It grabs a hold on his song, holding it aloft until Anon can once again find his footing</p><p>>And where Fang's song gasps out in weakness, Anon's resounding chords pump life into it once more</p><p>>And so it was. where one guitar falters, the other is there to guide it back</p><p>>Nothing else in this moment exists to Anon, only his music and the music woven counterpart to his soul springing forth from the shadow ahead of him</p><p>>The song hits its climax, the two becoming a singular whole as the uncharted ending exploded out from both of their hearts</p><p>>Nothing but silence greeted their fading notes</p><p>>Anon begins to believe the whole thing is some sort of elaborate prank. Is he playing to a canned audience?</p><p>>That thought is quickly quashed down, as the sheer wave of exuberance reverberates from the audience</p><p>>He didn't even know girls can hit that octave holy shit</p><p>>The cascading shadow over his drum-hat brought Anon out of his daze</p><p>>Wait, is Fang coming towards him?</p><p>>Oh fuck</p><p>>It's too late. Something clamps down on the drum and wrenches it off Anon's head before his hands can possibly secure it</p><p>>The blinding stage-lights pierce into his eyes, his head dropping down to protect them</p><p>>Wait, this chair</p><p>>Oh fuck this is a wheelchair</p><p>>Might be suitable depending on how this turns out I guess.</p><p>>His vision slowly climbs back up to view what he believes is his goth-grim-reaper</p><p>>There she is, standing before him.</p><p>>"I knew it."</p><p>>Shock reverberates through Anon, prompting his eyes to finally meet Fang's</p><p>>The expression he expects her to be wearing isn't there</p><p>>In its place, with tearful eyes dripping ruined mascara, beams a glowing smile</p><p>>"Come on, they're waiting for us."</p><p>>Fang's hand grips onto Anon's forearm, hauling him up from the chair and bringing him center-stage to fully appreciate the adoration coming from the audience</p><p>>Despite the growing demand from the audience for a encore, there is only one response to give with such a packed event</p><p>>"THANK YOU STICKSTOCK WE LOVE YOU!"</p><p>>As the curtains close on the band, Fang's wings close on Anon, wrapping him up along with her tattooed arms</p><p>>The hug is much more subdued than the one Anon remembers from that one fateful gig he helped with before, but no less heartfelt</p><p>>They stand together like that for as long as they can, but the world waits for no-one</p><p>>"Fang! Drumstick! Come on! Get your stuff, we gotta go!"</p><p>>They break apart, barely held emotions showing clear on their faces</p><p>>Both Fang and Anon grab their equipment, using the wheelchair as a mock-handcart</p><p>>Both of them push the wheelchair with a hand, the other entwining with its soul-bound opposite</p><p>>Fang then turns to Anon, "I think a certain dweeb owes me dinner."</p><p>>Anon lets out a watery laugh, before replying, "Yeah. I owe you a drumstick don't I?"</p><p>>The jab and resulting light pain to Anon's shoulder was well worth the sounds of Fang's laughter in his opinion</p><p>>He can definitely use that to excuse the tears trailing down from his eyes</p></div>
