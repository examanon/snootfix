<h1>Hanging Out Till The End</h1><div><p>[Reed]</p><p>"Ppfffpfppthhh! Hahaha! Anon, you are such a retard."</p><p>â€‹</p><p>Yeah okay, maybe I can't chug a beer while doing a handstand.</p><p>So what?</p><p>I bet it's like...</p><p>Nobody can do it.</p><p>"Whaattt are you saying dude?"</p><p>Huh?</p><p>[Anon]</p><p>"ididntsayanything"</p><p>She takes a puff from her toke, rolling her eyes.</p><p>"You're mumbling maaan... Like, all the time."</p><p>Oh yeah, that sounds familiar.</p><p>I get up from the awkward position that I landed in, propping myself up against the side of my bed next to Reed once again.</p><p>"Yea, I do that sometimes... I'm told."</p><p>"Told by who, Fang?"</p><p>"Yeah, her. I mean they. Them. Fang."</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>The name puts a bitter taste in my mouth. I reach for my bottle that is miraculously only half-spilled, and down the rest.</p><p>Afterward, I toss the empty bottle away.</p><p>"What was that? Something up with Fang?"</p><p>She offers me the joint that I gladly accept, taking a long drag.</p><p>I'm not sure what Reed put in this shit, but the substance works its magic quick as fuck.</p><p>Certainly more than weed.</p><p>"We uh... We broke up."</p><p>I pass it back to her, and brace myself for the post confession interrogation that is sure to follow.</p><p>But it doesn't.</p><p>"I'm sorry man."</p><p>She takes a drag herself.</p><p>"Like, when though?"</p><p>"I dunno, like, a few weeks ago?"</p><p>"Seriously? Nobody said anything to me about it."</p><p>"Like, why wouldn't you tell me?"</p><p>She's getting uncomfortably serious. I steal the smoke from her and don't let go till she takes it back.</p><p>"whatdafackman"</p><p>"It couldn't have been that bad."</p><p>What is there to say.</p><p>I look up at the ceiling, letting the heavenly numbness spread through my body.</p><p>Guess Reed took it as a good enough answer, cause the next thing I feel is her slender arm wrap around my shoulders.</p><p>"It's like, whatever man... You gonna be okay tho?"</p><p>I nod slightly but don't answer.</p><p>She goes silent after that for a bit. Her arm feels nice and warm.</p><p>The next time she speaks, there is a weird edge to her voice. Like she's trying to feign indifference or something.</p><p>"So you're uh, totally splitsville?"</p><p>I can feel her arm tensing up a bit as she waits for my answer.</p><p>"I guess."</p><p>"Haha so like, now we can totes be bachelors in Europoo and shit..."</p><p>wut</p><p>"What about Trish?"</p><p>"...I guess we can invite her too?"</p><p>Her surprise just confuses me even more. I turn to face her all serious like.</p><p>"That's not what... I mean, isn't she like, your girlfriend or something?"</p><p>She gives me a weird look, eyes narrowing as she takes a drag from a new joint.</p><p>I didn't even notice her lighting that shit up, fucking ninja.</p><p>In the end, she laughs in my face.</p><p>"Hahaha, oh my gawd, you legit thought we were like, dating?"</p><p>Uh...</p><p>Uhhhhhhh.....</p><p>"No?"</p><p>"Hahahahaha"</p><p>"Fuck me hahrhahhrahrha"</p><p>Her giggles turn dino snorting-ish, tears rolling down her face.</p><p>"Oh my dude, you are seriously a weirdo retardo."</p><p>She gives me the joint, and wipes the tears from her redded cheeks. Getting a bit more serious as she straightens up.</p><p>"Nah, we ain't dating dawg."</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Fuuuuck.</p><p>Meeee.</p><p>THERE IS A SINGLE FEMALE IN MY ROOM</p><p>DEFCON MAXIMUM LEVEL</p><p>SKYKING SKYKING SKYKING</p><p>HOW MANY SKYKINGS IS TOP LEVEL</p><p>"Haha, but can you eat all the eggs?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>I try to retreat the fucking flood of spaghetti back into my pocket before I go all up bucatini.</p><p>DO.</p><p>NOT. </p><p>SAY.</p><p>I can eat you out or w/e.</p><p>...</p><p>In the end, I say nothing.</p><p>Successfully navigating the smoke in my shaking hand to my mouth I let the miracle of drug abuse wash my awkwardness away.</p><p>Hopefully.</p><p>Meanwhile, Reed positions herself closer to me, and I can feel her warm scales push up against my arm.</p><p>Now I also have a way too fucking good look all over the insides of her loose tank top.</p><p>"So like, maybe I could be your girlfriend for tonight, Anon?"</p><p>I almost choke on the fumes.</p><p>Did this bitch just quote globohomo memes?</p><p>Wait, but more to the point...</p><p>"uhhh"</p><p>Outstanding performance!</p><p>I decide to shut my fucking face instead, and look down at her.</p><p>Reed is pressing her back against my arm and chest, playing with one of the locks of her long hair.</p><p>Or mane. Idk.</p><p>Her at all times seductive eyes are giving a very distinct fuck me look.</p><p>Oh boy.</p><p>I have no idea what to fuck to say or do, but luckily Reed is not taking a retard for an answer. </p><p>She wraps one of my hands into her surprisingly big dino-sized palm, and places it on her bra under the baggy tank top.</p><p>"What do you say, big boy?"</p><p>With the powers of dino tiddy I drown the urge to say "For you".</p><p>I gently, awkwardly cup her breast, feel it up through her bra. She bites her lip, humming softly in response.</p><p>Wow this is like... Hot as fuck.</p><p>I shift a bit so I can utilize both hands, earning another giggle.</p><p>"Mhm, you likey? Did Fang ever let you?"</p><p>My arms stiffen, and Reed herself quickly recognizes that she fucked up by mentioning h- them again.</p><p>Fuck me, is this how it's always gonna be now? It's been weeks.</p><p>Get over it already you fuckwad!</p><p>I clear my throat and resume pumping her breasts. She's surprised, but visibly pleased.</p><p>"No we um, we figured out kissing. Kinda."</p><p>With a giggle Reed turns to face me, getting up on all fours. I can't not notice that her bra is almost falling off of her, revealing her bare breasts.</p><p>"So you've never actually been with a girl before?"</p><p>She winks teasingly, and takes one last puff from - wait when the fuck did she take that from me?</p><p>Anyway, she flicks the butt away and crawls into my lap, sitting up into a cowgirl position.</p><p>My hands instinctively move to her waist, hoisting her up properly.</p><p>I'm sure that about now my face would just be red as her scales, if only my blood wasn't busy building a tent in my pants.</p><p>Like, a five fucking dimensional tent fuck me Reed you are killing me.</p><p>"S-So, have uhm, have yoouuu beenwithanyonebefore?"</p><p>She giggles again, running a hand through her mane, the other slowly but surely making its way down on my chest and stomach.</p><p>"Maybe I have."</p><p>She leans in closer, her voice turning into a whisper.</p><p>"Or, maybe I haven't?"</p><p>"Are you going to take my virginity, Anon?"</p><p>By the end her snout is right beside my ear, her hot breath covering my everything.</p><p>At the same time, she finally reaches my belt buckle, and runs a few of her fingers along my skin under it.</p><p>OhhhfuuuckmmeeReeeed...</p><p>The only response I can muster is grabbing her meaty parts harder, pulling her body close.</p><p>I run my hands over her ass, and... Wait. Wait what the- Oh is? Oh my god is that her tail?</p><p>Reed fuck you your tail is awesome.</p><p>I start laughing like a retard, playing with her ass and tail.</p><p>She's guffawed but joins in after a few seconds.</p><p>"Dude, are you like... Hey, you can play with it later okay?"</p><p>She straightens up and takes my toy away, like a mom scolding her child.</p><p>Not a beat later off comes her top. Oh. Oh my.</p><p>"Fucking weirdo man..."</p><p>She murmurs, closing in the gap between us again, making a point of placing my hands over her bra.</p><p>There's no anger in her voice though.</p><p>She returns her attention to my belt, undoing it with clear expertise.</p><p>Virginity my ass. Or maybe she gave a lot of handjobs.</p><p>"Reed, did you give a lot of handjobs?"</p><p>I can practically feel her inner struggle.</p><p>"Anon, are you... Asking me to give you a handjob?"</p><p>"Y-yes?"</p><p>"Umm..."</p><p>She tries to get back into the flow, playing around with my boxer and having her long fingers slightly brush up against my dick.</p><p>It doesn't seem to work though.</p><p>She gets up with a frustrated "UGH", obviously upset.</p><p>"Geez, sorry Anon, I just... Ugh!"</p><p>I open my mouth, however she quickly intercepts me before I could ruin the mood even more.</p><p>"Just give me a minute you dork, aight?"</p><p>She corrects her bra while fishing yet another joint from her wallet, lighting it up in mere seconds.</p><p>I follow suit and get myself a beer, opening it on the metal frame of the bed. Reed blows a few smoke rings, following my movement from the corner of her eye.</p><p>Looks like she wants to say something too, but instead she just takes one last deep drag and returns to my lap.</p><p>She offers the roll to me, but this time I refuse. She shrugs and takes my face into one of her hands, a lot more slow and lovey-dovey than the lusting haste from before.</p><p>"Then c'mere you ass."</p><p>We settle into a gentle kiss that is only a little awkward. I definitely have that butterflies-in-the-stomach feel, yet I can't shake the weirdness of it. Fang was the only one that I kissed before.</p><p>It doesn't feel wrong. Just, weird.</p><p>Once again, Reed's hand tracks its way down to my half chub, and I start groping her ass.</p><p>No tailplay this time. Heh.</p><p>The room quickly regains its frisky atmosphere as we get more and more into it. Soon Reed is riding me in rhythm with her strokes, and I'm trying to get her bra undone.</p><p>I want to interject and pull my boxers down too, but I don't want to risk another disaster. This feels great anyway.</p><p>Too great, actually.</p><p>OH</p><p>NO</p><p>I break away from the passionate kiss.</p><p>"Reed, I, I'm gonna-"</p><p>I see an evil grin make its way onto her face before I'm caught up in another kiss, Reed practically doubling her efforts to get me to soil my pants.</p><p>I try to hold on, but it's a losing battle. She rides out the climax with me to its very end, gradually slowing down.</p><p>Afterward she backs off, giving me a sly look.</p><p>"So how was that?"</p><p>I'm too caught up in the moment to respond, so I just watch her lick the mess off of her fingers.</p><p>With a what the fuck how long is that tongue.</p><p>"Wa' I uh goo' gi'lf'en'?"</p><p>She gives me one last peck on the lips once she's done, and crawls out of my lap.</p><p>"Go clean yourself up, dude!"</p><p>Yea, naaaah.</p><p>I'm practically still drooling on the spot.</p><p>Yeah, I uh, I'm just. Imma sleep k?</p><p>* * *</p><p>I awake to the bed shifting next to me.</p><p>"Whuh?"</p><p>"Chill, I just gotta go work."</p><p>Oh godddddd, my head is killing me. Also someone switched my tongue for sandpaper.</p><p>"But it's saturday?"</p><p>"Yeah, I know."</p><p>I open one eye with caution, taking in my surroundings.</p><p>Reed's already changed into another top that is a rather bland shirt, and is now buttoning up a new set of jeans.</p><p>A quick scan of the clock tells me that it's not even 10 am.</p><p>I grudgingly turn in bed so at least I face her general direction.</p><p>In the next few minutes she grabs her wallet and whatnot from various parts of the room, then returns to the side of the bed.</p><p>"Hey so, I work till six. I have some shit to do after that, but I can come back and crash the weekend...?"</p><p>It takes me a few seconds to process what she just said. Is she blushing?</p><p>Am I blushing?</p><p>"Y-yeah, I'd like that."</p><p>"Aight then, see you soon babe!"</p><p>She gives me a peck on the cheek, then hastily makes her way for the door. I'm too overwhelmed to respond.</p><p>What the fuck just happened.</p><p>Not only did Reed just kiss me, but she called me babe.</p><p>And why am I not more alarmed by this?</p><p>Geez, what the fuck happened here last night? Even attempting to remember puts my hangover brain into overdrive.</p><p>Midst my suffering I reach for my balls that are itching up a storm, only to be greeted by a crusty-sticky layer of-</p><p>Then it all comes back to me.</p><p>Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.</p><p>Oh god, we totally did it, right?</p><p>No wait, it was like... We had clothes on and stuff.</p><p>Jesus R. Christ.</p><p>What was I thinking? What will the others think?</p><p>What will Fang think?</p><p>Wait, why do I even care what Fang thinks?</p><p>Damn my head...</p><p>I stay in bed for a long time. Both to pull myself together and to assess the situation.</p><p>Are we dating now? She called me babe.</p><p>But it was just like, a quicky or something. Maybe it was out of pity cause I told her about Fang?</p><p>Or are we fuck buddies? Friends with benefits?</p><p>FUCK</p><p>She wants to stay the weekend? What the fuck is the time?</p><p>I look at the alarm, way too fast for my sluggish eyes to focus.</p><p>Just past noon.</p><p>Well, this is a good enough excuse to find some food I guess.</p><p>It only takes me ten minutes to crawl out of bed and make my way to the kitchen, wading through a labyrinth of empty bottles and opened bags of munchies. And clothes.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon is spent painfully tidying the place up, and stressing over the whole Reed situation.</p><p>I think about messaging her multiple times, but I don't want to bother her during work. Not that I have any idea what to say to her.</p><p>Later on I decide that if we're a thing now, I'm gonna be responsible about it and buy some condoms. It can't hurt to have 'em, right?</p><p>Some decent food maybe, enough for two.</p><p>I leave the flat a little before five. That should give me enough time to do a roundtrip before Reed finishes with her stuff.</p><p>There should be a convenience store to the north, just outside Skin Row. One of the cheap ones.</p><p>The journey there is uneventful, and so is picking out my items. Meals for two, and an XL pack of magnum dongs.</p><p>Might as well.</p><p>Really I spend most of the time examining my shoes, avoiding eye contact with anyone. Please god let the cashier not be the talkative type, this is embarrassing enough as it is.</p><p>[????]</p><p>"Um, hey Anon!"</p><p>Wait, what?</p><p>I look up, and Reed's staring me right in the face.</p><p>Oh no. OHNNNOOOOOO</p><p>A student working weekends?</p><p>Like, a typical cashier job at a cheap local chain?</p><p>Close enough so she can sleep in?</p><p>Why didn't I connect the dots?</p><p>She starts scanning my items nonchalantly, till she gets to the... The fucking. Till she gets to them.</p><p>I seriously contemplate running as she holds the pack up in the air in a very accusatory manner.</p><p>"Dude."</p><p>Be still my beating heart.</p><p>"You can't get me prego, dumbass."</p><p>"Uh, I knew that."</p><p>"Yeah sure, so this is for all your other gee effs then?"</p><p>She sets the pack aside and returns to scanning the rest. The only other item to pique her interest is some frozen lasagna.</p><p>"Oooh, me likey!"</p><p>"Aight, that'll be 23.50, stud."</p><p>I know that she's being sarcastic but I blush nonetheless.</p><p>I hand her the money and grab my stuff. There's no line behind me, so I try to be social and stay for a chat.</p><p>"So um, sup?"</p><p>She just shrugs.</p><p>"Eh, regular slow day."</p><p>"But hey, imma be off in like, twenty minutes tops."</p><p>"I know I've said that I have some stuff to do, but you could come along?"</p><p>"Sure, where are we goi-"</p><p>"Sorry Anon, uh..."</p><p>She motions towards another customer that just got in line, giving me an apologetic smile.</p><p>Not long after I'm waiting for Reed on a shitty worn-out bench, just outside the store. Only a little less confused than before. And a lot more embarrassed.</p><p>She seemed very cool with the whole fucking-like-rabbits-throughout-the-weekend idea. She also looked kinda expectant of the food being for both.</p><p>Oh, and she said "your OTHER gee effs". So that would imply she already is one.</p><p>Am I overthinking this?</p><p>With little to no experience about relationships, I have no earthly idea if we're considered a couple now. Or dating.</p><p>Is this going to be a date? Shouldn't that have been established beforehand, so we could like, prepare for it? Fancy clothes and stuff.</p><p>Although that would be awkward with a huge ass bag of groceries.</p><p>In the end I flip out my phone to soothe my nerves with good ol' fashioned shitposting.</p><p>>liking r63 Humanaomi shiggy diggy do</p><p>>bet u kiss girls faget</p><p>>inb4 traps aren't gay</p><p>>inb4 cant inb4</p><p>Oh yeah. Just as the replies start flooding in, loud commotion hits my ears.</p><p>"FINE THEN FUCKING GO"</p><p>[Reed?]</p><p>"OH I WILL"</p><p>"BITCH"</p><p>The door of the store flings open, and out comes a fucking pissed Reed.</p><p>She slams the door - as much as you can an automated one -, and, uh, suppresses a scream?</p><p>Only when she notices me do her shoulders loosen up, and she lets out a huge sigh.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"It's fine, don't worry about it."</p><p>"For real? It sounded kinda not fine."</p><p>She waves a hand dismissively.</p><p>"Boss is a cunt, that's all."</p><p>"But you didn't like, get fired?"</p><p>"Nah, nothing serious. Can we please drop it?"</p><p>Despite her anger from earlier, she seems cool now. Maybe it really is nothing.</p><p>Then again, if I'm to be her boyfriend, shouldn't I be THE person to push these things? Like, get her top open up?</p><p>Uhhhhhh...</p><p>Well, she did say please so I'm totally not a pussy for not asking.</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>Her smile almost convinces me that this was the right decision after all.</p><p>We hug it up for a bit, then get the fuck outta dodge. I let Reed lead the way, she knows where we're going.</p><p>"So um, not to bring up the other thing, but like... Why do you even work, I mean, at all?"</p><p>"I never would have thought that you're like, poor."</p><p>"Nah, we ain't poor dawg. I just gotta make up for the money I spend on kush."</p><p>"Wait, your parents know?"</p><p>"Haha, god no!"</p><p>"I mean, they might suspect it but they don't like, KNOW know."</p><p>"Plus I want to save up for a car. Not like that's gonna happen here."</p><p>Suddenly she looks flustered, like she said more than she should have.</p><p>"I-I m-mean cause like... It's uh, expensive ya know?"</p><p>What was that all about?</p><p>Before I could ask Reed points to one of the run-down dilapidated commie block type buildings bordering Skin Row.</p><p>"Oh haha, we're here!"</p><p>"Uh, Reed, what the fuck are we doing here?"</p><p>"This is where I get my carfe from."</p><p>"There's this stego dude on the top floor. Used to be a hunter so he's got connections or something."</p><p>"Point is, he's been my supplier for I dunno, a year maybe?"</p><p>I really don't know how to respond.</p><p>We scale the stairs in silence, neither of us is overly enthusiastic about trying our luck with the elevator.</p><p>My lungs are about ready to burst when we make it to the top. Reed is visibly out of breath too.</p><p>"Aight uh... Dude can be a bit of a dick, so... Be prepared."</p><p>"Prepared for what?"</p><p>"To jump. Bounce. Skedaddle. That sort of thing."</p><p>What the fuck. Am I about to be shot and collected as a trophy?</p><p>I just nod and put on a mean face. Clench my jaw, furrow my brows. That's how that chad thing goes, right?</p><p>Reed seems amused, but doesn't comment on it.</p><p>We make our way to one of the more secure-looking doors, and she does a combination of knocks and rings.</p><p>How paranoid can this guy really be? Is being a weirdo a stego thing, that's where Stella got it too?</p><p>A few locks open on the inside and said stego steps through the doorframe.</p><p>He's tall - taller than me -, but scrawny. His rugged scales are hiding some serious muscle though. Like if you crossed a world class boxer and the shittiest meth addict that you could find.</p><p>He's also got that junkie scratch going on. Jesus.</p><p>Reed gives him some money, and the guy hands her a paper bag. All without a word.</p><p>That is, until Reed checks the contents of the bag.</p><p>"Dude, this is only half."</p><p>[Stego Dude]</p><p>"Pay half, get half, little girl."</p><p>"Bullshit half! I've even put in a tip you asshole."</p><p>"Pay half, get half. If you're short on money--"</p><p>"I'm not giving you a tuggie, man."</p><p>Uh, what?</p><p>Reed tries to give the bag back, but the guy doesn't budge. I hope I'm just imagining that bulge in his pants.</p><p>Yeah, just a trick of shadows haha. Haha.</p><p>OH GOD</p><p>"Give!"</p><p>"Nah, don't think so. Have a nice day."</p><p>Just as he's about to close the door some force compels me the interject.</p><p>I step up to the guy, pushing Reed to the side.</p><p>"You've heard her man. Give."</p><p>Miraculously, my voice did not crack one bit.</p><p>I even push my chest out to appear like, a threat or something.</p><p>He eyes me head to toe. I can't tell what he's thinking.</p><p>"You think some hired muscle gonna do you anything here, little girl?"</p><p>Despite me standing right in his face, he addresses the words to Reed.</p><p>I don't let up though, and keep facing forward.</p><p>No, you know what? Fuck you dickhead junkie wastoid. This is my gee eff.</p><p>Years of Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat surely won't let me down.</p><p>It all happens in slow motion.</p><p>I raise my left and shove the dude back. He's surprised, but almost immediately finds his footing.</p><p>I can faintly hear Reed screaming about "no" and "don't do it", but it's too late now.</p><p>It's his left cutting through the air now, the one with the money. Going straight for my head.</p><p>I shift to the right, avoiding the junkie's fist.</p><p>This may be my only chance to have the upper hand.</p><p>Can't. Waste. It.</p><p>SPEARS GIVE ME YOUR STRENGTH</p><p>I grab onto the guy's extended arm and lock my shoulder under his. Even with our height differences, I'm able to lift him a little.</p><p>No way I can do a suplex, but this should be good enough for a second or two.</p><p>"REED GET THE FUCKING MONEY"</p><p>"DO IT FAGET"</p><p>"OH NO YOU DON'T"</p><p>Some heavy-looking thing flashes on the edge of my vision. It connects to my lower back, shooting pain all over my body.</p><p>Aw fuck his fucking tail.</p><p>My legs turn to jelly, and I let go of the guy before we drop on the floor.</p><p>With my remaining strength I kick him square in the dick and back into his room. He falls down too.</p><p>Reed closes the door on him and screams into my face.</p><p>"FUCK ANON RUN"</p><p>Yep.</p><p>During the first few steps my legs almost give out, and Reed has to keep me upright to keep going.</p><p>Behind us the guy is opening his door again, so we bolt the fuck down the stairs.</p><p>I can't tell if he's giving chase, or like set some dogs on us or something.</p><p>We. Just. Fucking. Run.</p><p>All the way down, and then a couple of corners more.</p><p>The sprint turns into a jog once we're sure that he's gone.</p><p>We turn one last corner into a back alley, and stop to catch our breaths behind a big ass rusty trash container.</p><p>The only thing I can hear is my heart one upping the drummer from Through the Fire and the Flames.</p><p>Eventually, the cacophony of Skin Row comes back. Dogs barking in the distance, a baby crying somewhere, ghetto music blasting out of the windows, and dirty near radioactive drain water running through it all.</p><p>And Reed's heavy breathing.</p><p>I look at her, and she looks back at me.</p><p>Neither one of us is able to speak yet, just huffing and puffing.</p><p>A huge grin spreads on her face as she holds up her hand. Unmistakeably, there are a dozen or so crumpled up bills in there. The paper bag in the other.</p><p>Before I could contemplate the significance of ripping off a dealer, I find myself in Reed's embrace.</p><p>Out mouths and bodies connect in a lustful kiss, letting out all the spent up adrenalin.</p><p>She pushes me up against the wall, hopping up into my arms. Her legs and tail cross behind my back.</p><p>I hold onto her for dear life.</p><p>Heated minutes pass like this, us just making out. Reed eventually backs off, gasping for air.</p><p>"Wanna take this... back to your place... big guy?"</p><p>Heh. For y- WAIT</p><p>My place.</p><p>My...</p><p>Oh shit.</p><p>Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.</p><p>It dawns on me that I've lost my fucking groceries.</p><p>I put Reed down and quickly check my pockets. Thankfully my wallet and keys are there.</p><p>She's looking at me all what-the-fuck-yo like.</p><p>"The fucking food."</p><p>It only takes her a second.</p><p>"Oh fuck, where did you...?"</p><p>"I don't know. Before the fight."</p><p>She sighs, but her smile returns quickly.</p><p>"Well, you did rescue the money."</p><p>"An um, thank you."</p><p>She gives me a quick peck on the cheek. This seems to be her trademark gesture.</p><p>Moreover - after safely putting the money away -, Reed takes my hand, running her fingers between mine.</p><p>I nearly freeze on the spot, my already blushing face turning quite a few shades.</p><p>Profound sweating, was it?</p><p>"Come on you dork!"</p><p>Her tugging on my arm gets me to move eventually.</p><p>We cross a few more alleys, not daring to go out on the main street just yet. Tiredness catches up with us too, so by the time we make it to a decent looking store we're like walking dead.</p><p>It's close to 8 pm when we get back to the flat, and we're pretty much spent.</p><p>It wasn't such a bad haul though. Got some munchies, another albeit cheaper brand pack of frozen lasagna for Reed, instant noodles, and some miscellaneous sloppa to mix up.</p><p>Reed's been holding my hand the entire time, not even wanting to let go while paying for our stuff.</p><p>Feels good man.</p><p>After putting all the stuff away we crawl into bed like a couple of geezers. We make out for a bit, but neither of us has the energy to really go farther than that.</p><p>"Imma go take a shower. Wanna do something after?"</p><p>Fuck me, let's go for it.</p><p>"M-maybe we could um, do it together?"</p><p>She bites her lip, thinking about the offer.</p><p>"Sorry Anon, it's too early for that."</p><p>"But we like, almost had sex."</p><p>"Yeah, with clothes on."</p><p>"I mean we were gonna?"</p><p>"Sorry, but no."</p><p>"I'll make it up for you, aight? I just don't want to, like, rush it? Ya know."</p><p>Wow that sure wasn't the case yesterday.</p><p>Reed's sudden change of expression tells me that once again, I should stop with the fucking mumbling.</p><p>She looks like she's about to slam the bathroom door in my face, or pack her stuff and go home.</p><p>But she doesn't.</p><p>Instead, she returns to the side of the bed.</p><p>"Yeah, about that..."</p><p>She's avoiding eye contact.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>It was a pity handjob afterall.</p><p>I GOT TUGGIE'D MAN</p><p>I DON'T WANT TO TURN INTO A METH ADDICT STEGO</p><p>I DON'T WANT TO GO TO BRAZIL</p><p>"I thought you were gonna figure this out but, I um. I wanted to seal the deal, okay?"</p><p>I don't get it.</p><p>My helpless expression probably says as much, cause she just sighs and continues to explain.</p><p>"Look Anon, I've kinda had a crush on you for um, some time."</p><p>"So when you told me that you and Fang broke up... I just didn't want to waste the opportunity."</p><p>"Please don't think I'm a slut or anything."</p><p>She goes silent for a while, but shuts me up when I try to speak up.</p><p>Looks like this is painful for her to say.</p><p>"I was being you know... I wanted to like, sell the whole package so you won't back out."</p><p>"Please I... I don't want to guilt you into a relationship. All of this was pretty shitty of me to do."</p><p>"I don't even know what Fang will think. ...or Trish, for that matter."</p><p>Wow, this is some heavy stuff.</p><p>My gut instinct would say "Fuck them", but... They're Reed's friends, and besides, this isn't even the immediate issue.</p><p>I mean, is there even an issue here? Who cares how we got together?</p><p>Like, okay if she becomes a frigid cunt I'd feel kinda cheated.</p><p>I really should say something about now.</p><p>"I... Don't care?"</p><p>Oh god that sounded horrible keep the ball rolling.</p><p>"I mean, I'm happy that you like me cause I like you too."</p><p>"...maybe I feel a little, I dunno, like I've expected you to keep being frisky. But I don't want to rush anything either."</p><p>"This morning I wasn't even sure if you gave me a pity jerk off because of Fang. Or if you wanna be fuck buddies or whatever."</p><p>"And uh, if that was the case, I mean it would have been cool but... That's just not all I want from you."</p><p>"Jesus, I can't phrase for shit..."</p><p>"And look, if Trish or Fang or whoever has an issue with this, that's on them."</p><p>Even though my most sincere efforts, my voice still pinches up just a bit both times as I say Fang's name out loud. Once again, there's that bitter aftertaste.</p><p>I'm sure Reed noticed it too. I hope that won't be the only thing she takes away from all of this.</p><p>I reach for her hand, half expecting her to pull away.</p><p>She doesn't say anything either.</p><p>Quite a few seconds pass before she speaks up.</p><p>"You wanna take that shower together?"</p><p>Even my socially inept ass catches onto the fact that she's really asking: "Do you want a slutty girlfriend, or do you want a Reed girlfriend?"</p><p>Oh, this is a nightmare scenario.</p><p>If I say or imply yes, then we're either done for or she'd turn herself into advertisement-Reed to please me.</p><p>If I say no, she might think that I just want to impress her by giving the "right" answer. Or that I'm a pushover.</p><p>I could try to say I want a slutty-Reed girlfriend... In fact, she might actually be probing for how much I want this. What I expect the relationship to be.</p><p>Ugh, how do I even...</p><p>"You know that I would, but what we both want matters more. And that is not fucking this up."</p><p>"So ask again if you mean it."</p><p>That sounded pretty dope.</p><p>...right?</p><p>She takes her time weighing my answer.</p><p>In the end she crawls onto the bed, cuddling up to my side. She still won't make eye contact, but this is progress I guess.</p><p>I go for a hug, and she lets it happen. It feels nice, but it's like a so-close-yet-so-far scenario.</p><p>Okay Anon, time to cheer up your gee eff.</p><p>"So, did you even give that guy a tuggie?"</p><p>I try to put on a teasing tone, poking her shoulder.</p><p>Her voice is so soft that I almost can't make out what she says.</p><p>"...yes"</p><p>I sit up, suddenly fucking serious.</p><p>"Jesus, I just wanted to like, joke around but seriously?"</p><p>"It was just one time, okay? I was really stressed out, and it was midterms, and Trish was--"</p><p>Her speech speeds up as she talks, till she abruptly cuts herself off. She pulls her legs up under her, clutching onto my arm harder.</p><p>"...it wasn't just one time."</p><p>I'm so stunned that I don't even know what to do with this information. It explains both why she was so easy-going about jerking me off, and why she would want to take things slow.</p><p>But this is some fucked up shit.</p><p>I don't know what to say.</p><p>My impression of Reed was that she's this lighthearted jokester, but serious when she needs to be. After all, she's mostly top of her classes, apparently has a job...</p><p>But this is another thing in itself.</p><p>I'm so deep in thought that I almost miss the next part.</p><p>"But it hasn't happened lately, okay? And I wouldn't have done it today even if you weren't there. And I won't do it ever again."</p><p>...not that I could ever know.</p><p>But, okay. I can work with this. Everyone has their own fucked up stuff right? I wasn't transferred here for nothing. Plus whatever Fang stuff I still have to deal with.</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>The next few weeks were spent building a slow-but-steady relationship upon what brittle foundation we've got left after that day.</p><p>It was in mutual agreement that we don't fucking let anyone at school know. So we're mostly hung out on weekends, sneaking a date or two in there, or a kiss when nobody was looking.</p><p>Things were settling into a rhythm of sorts. Plus neither of us have been assassinated by the carfe mafia, so there's that.</p><p>We've never quite made it to having sex, but it wasn't cockblock valley either. Turns out Reed really was a virgin, that just happens to have uh, experience.</p><p>One thing that never sat well with me is that she never wanted me to meet her family. And every time monetary issues came up, she'd quickly change subjects.</p><p>First I thought this was because of her past with the dealer guy. But it felt more than that. She'd often turn sad after these exchanges, and I never could figure out why.</p><p>Lately, it started affecting everyday conversation as well. Our not-so-great sex life took a hit of it too.</p><p>Reed would start distancing herself from me more and more. The past few days she wouldn't even reply to my messages.</p><p>And then everything went up shit up sideways creek.</p><p>It's Monday, the last week of the year. After that, only the graduation ceremony.</p><p>I haven't seen Reed yet, and she didn't show any sign of activity on social media either.</p><p>I'm starting to get fucking worried.</p><p>Did carfe guy actually come back for her? Should I call the police?</p><p>Okay, calm down.</p><p>I'm not the only one who knows her. Let's ask Fa-</p><p>Let's ask Trish.</p><p>The next class is science, she should be there.</p><p>Time ticks away painfully slow till I spot the lil' trigga.</p><p>Not caring one bit how it looks, I powerwalk up to her desk.</p><p>"Have you seen Reed today?"</p><p>Her face contorts into the usual oh-Anon-is-a-fucktard-frown.</p><p>[Trish]</p><p>"Ha-ha, very funny."</p><p>What the fuck is she on about?</p><p>"I'm serious you asshole, have you?"</p><p>For once she looks deadass sad.</p><p>"Anon, they're moving to Japan."</p><p>Her words hit me in the face with the force of a freight train.</p><p>I swear that my insides are twisting up into a knot.</p><p>No.</p><p>THIS IS NOT HAPPENING</p><p>She's lying.</p><p>It's Trish. Trish's is a liar!</p><p>"Fuck you, I want to see her."</p><p>"Fuck YOU! I was her friend before you!"</p><p>I want to shake the lying bitch, throw her out the window, then throw her back in and out again, and--</p><p>Her phone buzzes, Reed's face plastered on the screen.</p><p>I scoop it up before Trish could do anything about it. Well, no. She actually tries to put up a resistance I just deck her in the jaw and run.</p><p>Out of the classroom, almost tackling the teacher just entering. I don't even listen to their protest.</p><p>Out of the school, and into the thick of the garden.</p><p>Of course, Reed's call has long ended. Maybe she'll answer if I call her on this phone. Or maybe she'll call again.</p><p>My hands are shaking up a storm.</p><p>Reed...</p><p>They moved away? When? Why? Why wouldn't she tell me?</p><p>My thoughts are a mess, even the coherent parts are jumbled together. A lot of Reed's behavior is now explained, but...</p><p>I feel betrayed, to say the least.</p><p>I can't handle being in school right now. I know that I couldn't sit still on the bus or in a taxi either.</p><p>So I just run.</p><p>My morning walk that takes up to about an hour flashes by in mere minutes.</p><p>Reed still hasn't called.</p><p>Trish probably told the teacher by now at least. </p><p>Maybe the principal.</p><p>The police could be on their way too.</p><p>Or my parents.</p><p>How could Reed do this to me?</p><p>I stare down at the phone in my hands with teary eyes, feeling the depression settle in.</p><p>Honestly, what am I doing here? Even if I reach her, what is there to do? What is there to say?</p><p>She's gone, and all I can do is say goodbye.</p><p>As if one cue, the phone rings.</p><p>It's Reed.</p><p>I don't answer it. I can't. Not now.</p><p>My hand forms a fist around the buzzing phone, as if I was about to crush it into dust.</p><p>No, this can't be how it ends. It just can't.</p><p>It fucking can't.</p><p>I will not allow it.</p><p>I still have weaponized autism on my side!</p><p>This time, before the call could end I flip my laptop open, the shittiest audio editing software that I've downloaded for Fang is still running.</p><p>I click record in the middle of whatever track I was editing and accept the call, on loudspeaker.</p><p>"Hey, Trish?"</p><p>I don't answer. I can't. Not now.</p><p>There's noise in the background. People speaking, shuffling about. Lots of them. Maybe a megaphone?</p><p>No, Trish said that they're moving! Could it be today?</p><p>It's an announcement system!</p><p>I close my eyes, trying to make a mental list of it all.</p><p>"Hey, are you there?"</p><p>A louder, clearer male voice overlaps with Reed.</p><p>"Come on, we don't have that much time."</p><p>It's probably her dad. They're about to board a... train? A plane?</p><p>I hear Reed sigh, and the call ends not long after.</p><p>I stop the recording, and get to work with all of my knowledge of sound engineering.</p><p>...which is not a lot.</p><p>I delete huge chunks of the previous song in the process, but I don't care.</p><p>I just need to clean it up enough to make out the announcements.</p><p>At the same, I'm pulling up all nearby transport hotspots and plotting travel routes for Japan.</p><p>My patience ends soon, so I go through the recoding again. The only parts I can make out are maybe "boarding group"?</p><p>It's a plane!</p><p>I check the schedules and-</p><p>All of my hopes are once again crushed.</p><p>There is no way I can make it there in time.</p><p>She's literally out of my reach now.</p><p>Wait, maybe...</p><p>According to the website, they're taking a flight with a stopgap in the middle. Maybe they couldn't book tickets in advance, or maybe they don't have the money for a better flight.</p><p>Point is, there is another flight that would arrive before theirs.</p><p>I double, triple check the departure and arrival terminals. It could work.</p><p>It has to work!</p><p>The ticket is pricey as fuck, especially since it's last minute. Almost all of my savings, gone.</p><p>But money is no object for a quest such as this.</p><p>Still, I barely have enough time to buy it and call a taxi.</p><p>I leave Trish's phone behind. I desperately want to take it with me, if only to hear Reed's voice.</p><p>But I don't. There's only one end to this story, and it will be a happy one.</p><p>By the time I arrive at the airport their plane has long taken off. Mine should be boarding in the next few minutes.</p><p>Thank fuck Trish didn't get the police involved after all. Maybe she understood the situation?</p><p>I doubt it, but she also had no other reason not to rat me out.</p><p>It's a long flight, but I don't sleep one bit.</p><p>After landing, it should take about ten more hours for Reed and her family to get here.</p><p>I double and triple check again. This is the terminal they should arrive at.</p><p>I'm about reduced to a mumbling mess of shaky limbs by the time their plane is announced.</p><p>In the past few hours I've gone over it again and again, but...</p><p>What if Reed won't be happy to find me here?</p><p>She left me on purpose.</p><p>She cut me off.</p><p>Could this have all been for nothing?</p><p>Plus stealing her friend's phone, tracking her down here... That's creepy to normal people, right?</p><p>My mind just about goes blank when I spot her in the crowd.</p><p>I take a deep breath and look down at my hands.</p><p>They're holding a sign with the letters R E E D on it.</p><p>The R has a heart around it.</p><p>I want to hold it up, but my body won't move.</p><p>This is my moment, yet I'm too frozen up to take it.</p><p>Knees week.</p><p>Arms are heavy.</p><p>There's vo-</p><p>NO FUCK FOCUS</p><p>I can't see Reed anymore, the crowd is getting too thick.</p><p>Guess it's up to her now.</p><p>I take one last deep breath, and hold the sign up high in the air, waving it around a bit for good measure.</p><p>A second passes.</p><p>And another.</p><p>A minute, and then two.</p><p>I don't let go.</p><p>And then...</p><p>A familiar red-ping figure singles out of the crowd.</p><p>She's visibly shook, like she can't comprehend what she's seeing.</p><p>Her eyes are puffy and red. She's obviously been crying.</p><p>Carefully, she touches my elbow, as if to check that I'm real.</p><p>Her voice is faint and cracking.</p><p>"...A-Anon?"</p><p>I can't muster up the strength to talk, so I just nod.</p><p>I don't know what to do.</p><p>A few seconds pass in silence.</p><p>This isn't awkward, it's just that neither of us knows what to do with the situation.</p><p>Her hand that still lingers on my elbow twitches. At first, it looks like she will remove it, but instead it slowly moves to my face.</p><p>"Anon?"</p><p>She tears up, embracing me in a tight hug. One that I hastily reciprocate.</p><p>Reed's mumbling something into my chest, but I can't make any sense of it.</p><p>Truly, it is raining already.</p><p>We stand there for a while. I notice a few bystanders who I assume to be her family.</p><p>I don't give a fuck. Come closer and I'll deck 'em like a trigga too.</p><p>In the end, of course, they do come closer and Reed is forced out of the hug.</p><p>We make awkward introductions, where Reed announces me as her boyfriend. She's holding my hand again.</p><p>I explain my adventure to them as we leave, and they're generous enough to rent a hotel room for me.</p><p>Later that evening Reed confesses that she's known about them having to move for a long time, even before we got together.</p><p>There was no way around it.</p><p>She didn't tell me to spare the pain, and it nearly destroyed her instead.</p><p>It was not an easy conversation.</p><p>Then again, we're now both fresh graduates, and out of the clutches of our peers that would sneer upon our love.</p><p>A new beginning, where it's us against the world.</p><p>_ _ _</p><p>This story is dedicated to AngryAlicia.
