I thought you hated me! I’m in love with Fang! I thought she was your friend?”</p><p>>He rattles off other such nonsense to her, as if HE wasn’t the one that seduced HER</p><p>>Not quite where she expected this to go, but she had a backup plan.</p><p>>Trish kicks off the ground toward Anon, causing him to tumble again.</p><p>>This time Trish immediately gets to work.</p><p>>Removing his pants was child’s play and she could already see the outline of his dick in his underwear.</p><p>>Anticipation causes her to drool as it already looks bigger than she imagined.</p><p>“T-Tri-” Trish cuts Anon off.</p><p>“Ah, shut the fuck up skinnie, this already looks worse for you than it does for me. Now if you cooperate, no one has to know. Especially Fang.”</p><p>>Tears were forming in Anon’s eyes, he didn’t know what to do.</p><p>>The little trigger didn’t care anymore, she was lost in her lust.</p><p>>She pulls down his boxer briefs to reveal his flaccid member, it was definitely much bigger than she imagined.</p><p>>Not wanting to waste anymore time she takes it into her mouth.</p><p>>She places her hands on his testes and gently caresses them as she works the shaft.</p><p>>As she pulls her head toward the top she stops at his glans and runs her tongue around it.</p><p>>Anon involuntarily bucks into her mouth.</p><p>>She smiled as best as she could with a cock in her mouth.</p><p>>She had no practical experience, but all of her research was paying off.</p><p>>He was hard and that meant that he was ready.</p><p>>She gets up and removes her panties and leggings, her thighs already soaked in her own juices.</p><p>“Trish,” Anon pleads. “We can stop here, we can can forget all of this, everything can go back to the way they were!”</p><p>“Hmm,” Trish places a finger on her chin, playing as if she was thinking about it.</p><p>>But she had no such thoughts.</p><p>>Trish drops her hips on Anon’s and is rewarded with the most mind-blowing orgasm of her life.</p><p>>She had never felt fulfillment on this level.</p><p>>Her legs quiver as she attempts to lift herself, but in the moment they were too weak and she crashes back down on her unrequited lover.</p><p>>Anon couldn’t help his own instincts as his hips rise to meet hers.</p><p>>Her folds were too welcoming to resist almost as if they had been prepared specifically for him.</p><p>>Between her falling and his rising, they eventually create a rhythm.</p><p>>The sounds of their lust were muffled within the room as the foam pads absorb the vibrations.</p><p>>Anon could feel Trish orgasm continuously as her pussy gave him the dino grip over and over again.</p><p>>He didn’t want to admit it, but Anon couldn’t help feeling proud of himself.</p><p>>The purple trigger that he thought hated him was now riding him as if her life depended on it.</p><p>>And she loved it.</p><p>>Trish almost couldn’t believe that she had finally done it.</p><p>>Ever since she saw this idiotic monkey walk up the stairs to Volcano High, she knew she had to have him.</p><p>>But her best friend reached him first.</p><p>>Fang probably would have shared him with me if I asked, right?</p><p>"You know, part of me thought you two would just hatefuck and be done with it," Trish imagined.</p><p>>Yeah, she wasn’t going behind her friend’s back, this what she would’ve wanted anyway, right?</p><p>>Besides, he was walking around doing all of those things to impress her.</p><p>>Like, hanging around, and eating food, and being sweaty, and...shit.</p><p>>Is this what guys call post nut clarity?</p><p>“Tri-Trish, I’m gonna...” Trish was shaken from her thoughts.</p><p>>Oh fuck, he’s going to cum.</p><p>>Before her body could respond to her thoughts she was struck by another orgasm.</p><p>>Curse their innate compatibility.</p><p>>Trish feels Anon’s warmth enter her body as he lets out thick spurts of ejaculate within her.</p><p>>This was a unexpectedly pleasant feeling.</p><p>>Her hands stroke her belly where she can feel Anon inside her, following the trail from her pubic region to her navel.</p><p>“Fuck Anon, I didn’t think you would last that long.”</p><p>>Trish tried to play it cool, but the guilt was already wriggling within her mind.</p><p>>She raped her best friend’s boyfriend and had him cum inside her.</p><p>>Even if that last part was an accident, it was all her fault.</p><p>>Anon was very distressed, Trish could see that.</p><p>>He was crying and babbling, bringing up Fang, and pregnancy, and the chances of being discovered.</p><p>>Did this count as cheating for him?</p><p>>No. She forced him.</p><p>>She couldn’t just... undo what she just did, but she could maybe assuage his fears?</p><p>“Anon, Anon, Anon, I’m on the pill, don’t worry about me getting pregnant.”</p><p>>He managed to quiet his crying to a whimper.</p><p>“As for Fang, I’ll take the blame and tell her it was estrus.”</p><p>>Technically it was, even if it was out of season.</p><p>“Let’s get cleaned up. I have some wipes and stuff in my backpack.”</p><p>>Trish gets up and puts her panties and leggings back on, she had spares in her bag, but she definitely didn’t want to make a bigger mess in the booth.</p><p>>Anon was quick to get up and put his underwear and pants on.</p><p>>Trish still managed to get one last good look at his dick though.</p><p>>It’s definitely the last time she’ll see it.</p><p>>Trish produces some single use cleaning wipes from her bag, and hands some to Anon.</p><p>“Go get yourself cleaned up in the bathroom, I’ll take care of this room.”</p><p>>Anon, wordlessly nods his head and runs off.</p><p>>He was adorable sometimes, like a big dumb dog.</p><p>>She then pulls out some carpet cleaner and air freshener, she needed to remove the stench of sex before Fang and Reed showed up.</p><p>>Trish props open the booth door to let the room air out, and hopefully eliminate as much of the smell as she can.</p><p>>Pretty soon Anon comes back, a little frightened, but at least he was still here.</p><p>>She gets close to him and straightens up his clothes and does a smell check.</p><p>>He definitely still smelled of their one-time tryst, but hopefully it’ll clear up, or the others won’t notice.</p><p>“Anon, I’m sorry,” Trish starts.</p><p>>How the fuck do you rape someone and then say sorry?</p><p>“I wasn’t in my right head space, estrus will do that kind of thing to you, y’know?”</p><p>>Of course he didn’t, humans don’t experience estrus.</p><p>“I got it into my mind that you were seducing me and I couldn’t stop thinking about you.”</p><p>>These are just excuses at this point.</p><p>“I’ve done something unforgivable...again. This time I doubt you’ll ever give me another chance.”</p><p>>Tears start welling up in Trish’s eyes, she knew what came over her, but she didn’t even think to stop it.</p><p>>Heavy sobs escape from her, she had feelings for Anon, but she loved Fang too, they were practically sisters.</p><p>>Now she was full-blown ugly crying, unable to stem the flow of emotions escaping from her.</p><p>>But then, something unexpected occurred.</p><p>>Anon, was giving her a hug?</p><p>“I don’t know a whole lot about estrus and stuff, but…”</p><p>>Was he consoling her?</p><p>“But, I heard it can be pretty rough if you don’t handle it properly.”</p><p>>No way.</p><p>“Honestly, I don’t really want to think about what happened anymore. So let’s just forget the whole thing.”</p><p>>This definitely wasn’t the healthiest way of dealing with this, but Anon was the victim, so she’ll just go with whatever he says.</p><p>“Now, you need to get yourself cleaned up.”</p><p>>The whole affair took less than 30 minutes, so Anon and Trish had a bit of time to make sure everything was spotless and ready to go when the other two finally showed up.</p><p>>Anon rushed to meet his girlfriend and help her with her equipment, while Trish helped with Reed’s.</p><p>>After the setup, Anon wanted to use his limited experience to assist the producer as best he could.</p><p>>But the producer wasn’t interested.</p><p>>VVURM DRAMA managed to bang out recordings of two of their most well received songs.</p><p>>After the session, they still had a few moments before their scheduled time was up, and so Reed called a band meeting. Leaving Anon out again.</p><p>“Sorry bro, but this is just between us,” Reed tried to make it less personal, but…</p><p>“Is it me or does Anon-”</p><p>“Stink?” Fang cuts him off.</p><p>“Yeah, he almost smells like-”</p><p>“Stop right there, Reed, I don’t want to hear it.” Fang pinches the bridge of her snout.</p><p>>As much as she loved the idiot, Anon could be so clueless sometimes.</p><p>>Fang glances at Trish who was now beet red, Fang guessed that Trish didn’t want to embarrass her.</p><p>“It’s okay you two, I’ll…talk to him about it. Hopefully it won’t happen again.”</p></div>
