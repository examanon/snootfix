                    <p>Title: Stella's New Pet</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Stella</p><p>Rating: NSFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>â€‹</p><p>>Ending 2 Anon. Fang and Anon never get to meet each other when this event happens.</p><p>>As time goes on, Anon finds himself in a difficult position of near homelessness as jobs and money becomes harder to find.</p><p>>One day he bumps into a familiar stegosaurus, decked out in fancy clothing.</p><p>>While comparatively, Anon hadn't showered since the day before, and his clothing has become rough from the manual washes he's had to do.</p><p>>"Anon? Ohmigosh! Is that you, bud?"</p><p>>Anon realizes that voice was familiar, positively familiar at that.</p><p>>Anon's eyes widened when he realized the suited up, expensive looking woman in front of him was none-other than Stella.</p><p>>"Oh gosh... S...Stella? Wow, it's uh...been a while...yea. How're you doing?"</p><p>>Stella looks Anon up and down, a sweet smile coming to her face.</p><p>>"How am I doing? Lookityou, Anon! You look miserable, big guy! Hey. Come with me. You got a your own place? Anything like that?"</p><p>>Anon looks down, remembering the Apartment landlord told him not to comeback unless he had the money, which regretfully, he did not.</p><p>>All Anon had on him was his backpack containing a laptop, a few pairs of spare clothing, a sandwich, and a single knife...</p><p>>Living the dream...</p><p>>"Don't got the money for my place, all I got is what's on my back on the clothes I got on."</p><p>>A frustrated, defeated sigh escapes the human as Stella wraps him in a surprise hug.</p><p>>Come to think of it...what the hell is Stella doing around Skinrow?</p><p>>Anon ponders this and asks the dinosaur that question.</p><p>>Stella smiles and sticks out her tongue.</p><p>>"I work around here, silly! I'm actually the COO of a game company around these parts in Volcadera Heights. The company's called SO_LO. Pretty well known."</p><p>>Anon could hear the smug coming from her voice, but considering how high the position she had was, it was probably well deserved.</p><p>>Yet that didn't answer his other, unspoken question...</p><p>>"Wait. Why do you want me to come with you?"</p><p>>Stella tilted her head innocently with a smile that felt almost plastic, but he didn't try to let it get to him.</p><p>>"Well, considering you gave me a literal reason, not much of a way to refuse me now, huh?"</p><p>>Anon felt flustered and stuttered. "W-well... I guess no-"</p><p>>"Good! Now come on, dummy. I bet you're starving. After something to eat, a nice hot shower and a warm bed's in order for my favorite human."</p><p>>Anon felt something nag at the back of his head at that, but fuck it. Free food and a free shower to go with a bed? Who could pass that up?</p><p>>If only he realized sooner what he was getting himself into...</p><p>>It had only been a few weeks after Anon had "moved in" with Stella.</p><p>>His own room, food, warm bedding, everything. The whole package. Anon was in heaven.</p><p>>It was like a dream come true, Stella coming to practically rescue him.</p><p>>One thing that piqued Anon's curiosity however was the fact that she bought him clothes.</p><p>>In fact, Stella bought Anon a LOT of things. Whatever he might've wanted at one point, he'd find it in his room one way or another.</p><p>>Anon felt kind of guilty by the fact that Stella had been buying him so many gifts.</p><p>>She even went so far as to start getting him clothes for him to wear.</p><p>>After some time, it'd already been a good few months, and Anon was safe to say, he'd pretty much moved in with Stella.</p><p>>What surprised Anon was the size of her house. For one lady, it was quite something.</p><p>>Three bedrooms, two of them with their own bathrooms, two full extra bathrooms, and a single half bathroom near the kitchen.</p><p>>Did he mention the fucking kitchen? It was ginormous, giant island counter in the middle of it and everything.</p><p>>All of the kitchen-ware a chef or housewife could dream of.</p><p>>Currently Anon and Stella were conversing in said kitchen.</p><p>>"Jeesh, do you use this whole kitchen, Stella? It's kinda huge for just one person."</p><p>>The smile she gave him seemed strained almost, but still she persevered.</p><p>>"Oh you know. I try! With you here though, I can finally show someone my cooking skills for once."</p><p>>That's another thing Anon found he enjoyed about his new residence.</p><p>>Free, homecooked food every single day.</p><p>>Boy, life was grand. A cute woman took care of his needs, what else could make this better?</p><p>>He thought that over and over now, in his newest situation...</p><p>>Stella was at his door in nothing but a shirt. Her eyes stared into his, it felt like he was staring at his a completely different person...</p><p>>"St...Stella? What-"</p><p>>Before he could finish his question, Stella rushed in, pushing him down to his bed with incredible speed.</p><p>>Anon could barely get a sentence out, let alone any kind of noise of protest.</p><p>>Not only was Stella constantly moving, the way she moved, practically wrapping herself around Anon, made it impossible to do a single thing.</p><p>>She was all over him, huffing what he assumed was his scent, licking him in places he felt a bit too embarrassed to think about.</p><p>>There was finally a pause in the sexual harassments for Anon to catch a break. The darkness of the room made it hard to see his feminine assailant on top of him.</p><p>>All he could see... The hunger in those brilliant blue eyes. It made him feel like a piece of meat being devoured by a predator.</p><p>>He felt shuffling near his groin, fabric being moved, wetness, then this tightness. He had to grit his teeth to keep himself from finishing right then and there.</p><p>>Stella began moving up and down in a frantic, irregular pattern, nothing but release on her mind it seemed. Anon decided to just let it happen for now...</p><p>>While it hadn't bothered him too much, it felt like he was being taken advantage of right now. The way she just took charge, whether he was comfortable or not...</p><p>>Might as well take advantage of the situation as much as he can then. Grabbing onto Stella's rear, he started pushing himself in further, much to her agreement.</p><p>>"That's it, Anon... Just a little longer. I'm close. Are you?"</p><p>>He opted to keep silent for now, not that she seemed to care too much. She went back to stuffing her face into his neck, taking long huffs of him.</p><p>>"Shit... Stella. I'm getting close..." She responded by going faster, even wrapping herself tighter around Anon. He didn't like where this was going.</p><p>>If she didn't get off soon, he might finish inside, and he was NOT ready to become a father now. It was too late though, she wrapped herself around him.</p><p>>It was near impossible to get her off him. "Oh God! Stella, please! I'm gonna cum inside! Get off, hurry!"</p><p>>Poor choice of words.</p><p>>"Oh God Anon you have no idea~! A little more, I'm close!"</p><p>>"S-Stella that's not what I meant! *hah* I meant I'll f-finish Ihhhn You!"</p><p>>It was too much. He felt Stella shudder as she tightened up down there. It was coming, just like how Stella was right now.</p><p>>It shot out so fast and hard, Anon could swear he saw white around his vision, his body felt like it was melting from the action.</p><p>>Stella wasn't stopping, instead, riding their orgasms out to the very last bit. Anon felt himself be drained of his strength.</p><p>>He just came inside Stella. She was more than likely pregnant...but right now he could care less.</p><p>>He's never felt that way before with a partner. While this wasn't his first rodeo, this was his first amazing one, that was for certain.</p><p>>Yet he realized he'd practically been used like a sex toy by Stella.</p><p>>"Stella..."</p><p>>All he felt was the slow, rhythmic breathing of a sleeping Stella. Shit...</p><p>>He was even still inside her... She didn't bother trying to slip him out.</p><p>>But he just stopped caring at this point. His body hurt with exhaustion from what just happened.</p><p>>Instead, maybe it was time to just sleep. Maybe this would blow over at some point...</p><p>>Who knows. All he knew was that he just got sexually assaulted by a cute Stegosaurus.</p><p>>Guess it's true that weebs have the most sexual energy of them all. Anon chuckled to himself at that thought.</p><p>>His last thought was of him and Stella having a kid. While this would've worried him, he was too far into the lull of sleep to fully realize it.</p><p>>Soon, he joined Stella in her slumber, both of their sweaty bodies never once separating from one another.</p><p>>The end...</p><p>>???</p>
