                    <p>Title: Bro Job</p><p>Characters: Anon, Reeda</p><p>Rating: NSFW </p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: PogBot 9000</p><p>Summary: Anon is trying to get over his break up while hanging out with Reeda who offers him a listening ear. But it's discovered Reeda actually had feelings for Anon as well.</p><p>â€‹</p><p>"Bro, what the fuck!?" Exclaimed Reeda, gripping the Xrox controller in her hands, trying to bend and snap it in half. "I swear to fuck I'm gonna kill whoever invented dual-wielding needlers!"</p><p>I couldn't help but cackle. "So why don't you just start using them too?"</p><p>"Gamer code of honor, bro. I REFUSE to stoop so low."</p><p>"Whatever you say. Good luck getting out of Boulder-ranked lobbies with that attitude."</p><p>She waved me off, slightly agitated by my response, and started another match of Rock Ring while I sat on my bed and watched her play. At least this match wasn't such a travesty, her K/D was positive and her team appeared to be winning so far. In the midst of her match, I went to the fridge to grab a soda.</p><p>"Yo, grab me one too?"</p><p>"Yeah, sure."</p><p>I grabbed another can and joined her on the floor, passing her one of the off-brand sodas.</p><p>"Thanks, man."</p><p>The next couple of minutes mostly consisted of watching Reeda play more Rock Ring matches, swearing one after the other "last match, I promise". This happened a good 5 times before she finally sat the controller down, ending on a positive win-rate.</p><p>"Thanks for having me over, dude. Been meaning to come over for a while but never really got around to asking. You're a total bro, though."</p><p>"No worries, dawg. It's nice having friends over. Helps with the post-breakup depression, ya know?"</p><p>Bringing up the break-up already was beginning to put a damper on my mood, especially reliving our exchange. Truth be told, I haven't been the same man since. While we agreed to stay friends, which I was thankful for, I just couldn't look at her the same way since. We'd talk a little here and there, but nothing like when we first developed feelings for each other and started going out. I even started skipping out on going to the auditorium a lot of the time because it just hurt so much to see her after the break-up, on top of the fact Trish was being an absolute cunt and basically rubbing it in my face that we didn't last. God, I fucking hate that purple trigger bitch. I wanna rip off those stupid fucking horns of hers and jam them into her eye sockets every time she so much as looks at me. Fucking bitch. Looking over to Reeda, I see her holding out a lit joint, blowing a ring of smoke at my face.</p><p>"Before you talk yourself into an existential crisis, let's get you mellowed out. I don't want my best friend trying to off himself." She gave the joint a little shake, further tempting me to take a load off.</p><p>"I really shouldn't, Reeda. But..." I stared at the burning joint longingly as she took another hit, puffing the smoke in my face to give me another whiff of that premium quality kush, already feeling a bit more at ease from the contact. When she held it out to me once more, I happily took it. "Thanks. I really could use one right now."</p><p>"No prob, amigo. That's what friends are for."</p><p>I took a hit of the joint, sucking in some of that medicating smoke before hacking up a lung. It's been forever since I smoked anything, let alone weed. I need to get warmed up again. Reeda was having a snicker fit as I hacked, patting me on the back in a poor attempt at helping me out.</p><p>"C'mon don't be a pussy. Just a little kush, dude." She gave me a slap to the back, followed by a gentle rub as if she was trying to apply ointment to me or something.</p><p>"So..." Reeda began, scooching closer to me. "What's got ya so beat up as of late?" One of her hands found my knee, giving me an assuring pat.</p><p>Fuck, we really were about to open up fresh wounds. At least the idea of talking about it didn't sound nearly as bad as before now that I got a bit of medication in me.</p><p>"Fuck, man... Where do I even begin?"</p><p>"From the start. And I mean the VERY start of it, dude." The voice of Reeda had a dramatic shift. The usual stoned, almost hippy voice she normally used suddenly being forgotten, making it sound almost formal; corporate even.</p><p>I took another hit of the joint, running it down to a pitiful nub while Reeda lit another one, taking the first hit of the newly lit blunt.</p><p>"Well, when we first started dating, I was super excited. Spaghetti falling out of my pockets, hands clammy, all that shit. I just wanted to be around her as much as possible. Thing is, I've never had a girlfriend before, so I wasn't sure of all the things to say or do. I just kinda awkwardly hung out with her and tried thinking of how I could, like, express myself or just connect with her. Eventually she just called it off. I was fucking devastated, dude-"</p><p>I took the blunt Reeda passed me, sucking down a good toke before continuing with my ramblings. Even with the tranquilizing affects of the herb, I could feel all my emotions begin pouring out from me, my eyes welling up with tears as I recollected one of the most dreadful days I've ever had. Even as I went on with my retelling, Reeda was silent, looking at me intently with her hand still on my knee, her grip noticeably tightening as a way of giving me reassurance that she was still listening. Maybe I should just stop here. I'm already feeling so emotionally exhausted</p><p>"I haven't been able to speak to her. I can't even bring myself to look her in the eyes. And she's my lab partner too, dude. I just get this immense feeling of dread, like at any moment she's about to start berating me for being a terrible boyfriend. She was like, the first person I developed feelings for and I blew it... I blew it, dude..."</p><p>I could feel my eyes further watering, the tears threatening to start pouring down my face as Reeda scooted even closer, her hand leaving my knee and wrapping around my shoulders as she pulled me in close.</p><p>"Am I really that much of a fuck up? Am I that terrible of a boyfriend that I can't even show Fang how much she meant to me? Fuck, dude... I'm the biggest fuck-up imaginable. I can't even keep the only girl who's ever liked me!"</p><p>"Whoa whoa whoa, hold on, man. You need to stop this shit right now." Reeda shuffled around to put herself in front of me, a consoling hand on my shoulder while she pointed an accusatory finger right at my face. "First off, you're beating yourself up WAAAAY too much, dude. You're just inexperienced, amigo." Her hand left my face and instead planted itself on my other shoulder, her weight pushing my back against the bedframe, basically leaving me trapped between her and my bed. "Second, you're a fucking catch, dude. I can fucking PROMISE you Fang isn't the only girl who likes you."</p><p>I cleared the tears from my eyes, sucking in a deep breath as I looked up towards Reeda who was giving me a somewhat comforting smile on top of her grip on my shoulders tightening. But even with that smile I was still having my doubts. Something told me she was just telling me this to make me feel better, but maybe there was a chance she was being authentic when she spoke. It was hard to say, given her red eyes. She was definitely somewhat stoned.</p><p>"I fucking doubt it's anyone I know, dude. Fang was-"</p><p>"No bro, Fang isn't the only one who likes you. Think REEEEALLY hard. Who is it you see everyday? She ALWAYS talks to you...?"</p><p>What the fuck is she talking about? It's not fucking Naomi; she's got Naser. It can't be Trish; she fucking hates me. I doubt it's Rosa since we don't really talk... Maybe Stella? I doubt it since I'm pretty sure she was talking to the football captain...</p><p>"Then who the fuck is it!? I literally don't know anyone that would actually like me!" At this point I was getting more livid than anything. Why the fuck is she trying to play the guessing game with me? I'm not in the fucking mood for this shit.</p><p>"Oh my fucking-"</p><p>Before Reeda finished her sentence, her hands were pressed to the sides of my face, pulling me in, her lips sealing to my own, and her eyes closing in frustration, the same kind of frustration one had trying to explain the same thing to someone over and over again. In pure shock, I froze. Something about this felt oddly wrong, like my heart still belonged to Fang, like I was committing an unforgiveable sin. But the following moments began to cast light on my depressing haze, and soon I began to make the realization: It was her. She liked me. How could I have been so blind? Have I just been selling myself short this whole time? Was she sending me signals I never picked up? I don't know. What I did know, however, was that it was... comforting. I wasn't alone anymore. I was with one of my best friends. And she kept me in her embrace to let me know her feelings were authentic. My shoulders began to relax as my stupor wore off and I began to look through a clearer lens just as the kiss was broken. Her eyes opened up and revealed a glow of newfound passion, something which I had never actually seen in her before.</p><p>"It's me, Anon. You fucking idiot... I like you."</p><p>Her voice was oddly dulcet despite the insult, like she was more thankful that she finally got to reveal her feelings for me. Then there was her pleading smile that bore the weight of her emotions as she saw me in such a miserable state; almost as if it caused her physical pain to see me in distress and her smile was the only thing she could offer to make me feel better. All this time I knew her, I never noticed the finer details of her being: Despite being a stoner, she didn't really smell like one. The cheap perfume she wore tingled my nostrils with a feint flowery, citrus smell. Her rather unkempt hair had a controlled chaos too it, tying together well with her choice of clothing; what with her black Warped Tour t-shirt with the sides cut open, which gave a pleasing view of her body and her bra, and her torn, slim jeans. And those eyes. Never before had I seen a purple as deep as those gorgeous eyes. I could practically swim in them. It was like her iris was chiseled amethyst. It was... beautiful.</p><p>"Reeda. I-"</p><p>I glanced down, realizing my hands had found themselves comfortable on her waist, my hold gentle yet firm to keep her from moving away from me. When our gazes met once more, her eyes seemed to soften and her pleading smile turned into a more hopeful one, as if she knew the very words I was about to speak.</p><p>"I- like you too..."</p><p>The tug at my heart was palpable upon my utterance, to the point I could see the look Reeda gave me, assuring me she was there to give me the support I needed, which helped me to work past my apprehension to act further. Without much thought other than wondering if I was right in doing so, I began pulling my raptor friend into my lap, which was met with a little shuffle and scoot to place herself on my waist. This time, it was my turn to initiate, and pressed my lips to hers, Reeda's arms wrapping around the back of my neck while she met me half way in our lip lock. One of use breathed a sigh of relief, though it was likely me seeing as how my chest didn't feel so tight anymore. The next thing I realized, Reeda's tail was looped around my right leg, in addition to her head canting to the side to deepen our kiss, her raptor tongue even slithering past my lips as she pressed herself against my chest. My head naturally canted in response, the kiss deepening, and our mouths periodically opening to keep our embrace deep, the make-out session lasting another couple minutes as Reeda's fingers began to curl, her nails (or talons?) began raking my back, nearly tearing up my shirt. When our kiss finally broke, I was left to labor my breaths while my friend hardly had to catch her breath.</p><p>"You should really learn to not hold your breath, dude." She remarked, barely stifling a giggle as she looked down at me.</p><p>"It's... not my fault... you sucked the air... out my lungs..." I retorted, then met with a playful slap to my chest.</p><p>"Not my fault my skinnie boyfriend is a good kisser." She chimed.</p><p>I rolled my eyes, my face only growing slightly warmer from the compliment. All of a sudden, my mouth started tasting funny. I smacked my lips. Yeah, it tasted like weed, blegh.</p><p>"You good, dawg?" She asked, rubbing my shoulders.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm fine. Mouth tastes like weed though."</p><p>"Wanna wash that taste out with carnival food?"</p><p>"No way, there's a carnival in town!?"</p><p>"Uh, yeah dude. It's down at the boardwalk. They got some killer funnel cakes." Reeda hopped out of my lap, leaving me rock-hard on the floor before she pulled me to my feet with a surprising amount of strength. "I can teach you how to be the perfect boyfriend while we're at it, too."</p><p>I fixed my boner, tucking it down one of my pant legs while Reeda observed me openly. "Aight, I'm down." I stepped towards the door and held it open for her, my new girlfriend walking by and then groping my crotch.</p><p>"Nice cock."</p><p>Well that certainly caught me off-guard. I can already tell this relationship is gonna be WAY different than my previous one. "Thanks, I grew it myself."</p><p>The earned a snort of a laugh.</p><p>Our trip to the boardwalk was rather short, really consisting of nothing more than Reeda giving me some pointers on how to be a good boyfriend, even giving me credit for holding the door open for her earlier. But she wasn't the only one to be giving someone pointers. Noting the games I spectated when Reeda was playing Rock Ring, I managed to give her some kind of advice, mostly telling her how to take different maps, weapon locations, and of course teasing her about not dual-wielding needlers, which she remained adamantly against. In any case, the walk was relaxing, especially in the company of my stoner girlfriend, perfect to take my mind off of Fang.</p><p>"Now, are you ready for the final test, Anon-san?" Reeda asked, putting on what had to be, without a doubt, one of the most offensive Japanese accents I have ever heard.</p><p>"I think I'm ready."</p><p>"Excelente!" We stepped through gateway, bringing use into the boardwalk where we could see carnival rides and booths set up. "Your test staaaarts... Now! Quick, your girlfriend's got the munchies! What do you do?"</p><p>"Easy. I take her to get some food."</p><p>Just when I was about to grab her hand, Reeda pulled it away. "Wrong! You're missing something important. What did you forget?"</p><p>"Ok uhh- shit... I uhh... Oh! Where do you wanna eat?"</p><p>"Correct!" Reeda slinked up to my side, grabbing my arm possesively. "Funnel cakes. Now." She growled, gripping my arm as we walked to a nearby food stand and ordered the necessary funnel cakes for the two of us, covering us both for the food not out of a way to score points, but out of the fact I was coming to enjoy her presence more and more.</p><p>"You know I could've just paid for my own, right Anon?" Reeda questioned, plucking at her funnel cake with the plastic fork to get a bite.</p><p>"I know. Just felt like I should cover you since you gave me a free therapy session." I took a bite of my food, the greasy, powdered sugar-covered confection blessing me with saccharine bliss.</p><p>"Another 50 points for you, Anon. You're making great progress!" She chimed, polishing off the last of her funnel cake. Holy shit she could put away food. "Alright, step two, Anon. What's step two?"</p><p>Ah shit, I was already starting to forget what she told me. Fuck, what was it? I began looking around, struggling to remember what exactly it was she told me. Eventually, my eyes spotted the various game booths, such as ring toss, balloon darts, basketball, the whole nine-yards. That's it!</p><p>"Step two: Gift giving is a quick way to boost a girl's mood."</p><p>"Bingo! Now go get your girlfriend a gift!"</p><p>I tugged Reeda along, her giggles causing me to smile and even share a chuckle or two of my own. Starting at the ring toss, I pitched an entire bucket of those cheap, plastic rings, even sharing some with Reeda, watching her bright smile grow as she laughed along with me and tried for one of those cheap stuffed animals that wasn't even worth the price of trying for. The next booth was for knocking over a stack of bottles, though due to my own ineptitude, I failed spectacularly and earned a couple of jeers from Reeda, and of course the booth attendant. However, I finally got my redemption when we got to the balloon popping booth, where I managed to nail all three balloons to my own shock.</p><p>"Holy shit, Anon! You did it!"</p><p>"Holy shit, I did it?"</p><p>Reeda clung to my side, jumping up and down and then planting a kiss on my cheek. Once she settled down, she perused the hanging assortment of cheap stuffed animal, her eyes eventually fixing on what would be an obvious choice for her: a stuffed bong.</p><p>"That one." She demanded, pointing straight at the stuffed bong.</p><p>Before I could even ask, the booth attendant tossed the prize to my raptor date, who gave me another kiss on the cheek before going off to ride some of the rides whose safety was rather questionable. It was a rather standard assortment of rides: Rickety roller coasters, spinning wheels, large hydraulic swings, one of those swinging pirate ships, and of course, a Ferris wheel decorated with colorful lights, which would be our final ride for the night. Boarding the ride, it brought us to a clichÃ© moment, where the wheel was gradually brining us up to its apex for one of those cheesy rom-com scenes that always seemed to prevail modern cinema. While the wheel continued to spin, Reeda and I were shooting the shit, some compliments being thrown my way to praise me for my performance in her 'tests', which hardly felt like such. More like just a date with some half-assed tutelage. Though I could see as plain as day she was having a great time, which seemed to resonate that it was a rare experience for her, even when she was stoned off her ass. While she sat there, taking selfies with her stuffed bong and me in the background, I wrapped my arm around her shoulders, pulling her closer to me before she settled in and leaned her head on my shoulder, taking one of my hands, and brushing her thumb along the top.</p><p>"Well done, young grasshoppa. You've done well so far." She murmured, putting on another offensively Japanese accent for a moment then dropping it upon crossing her legs. "You learned the art of sating hunger, the art of gifting, and the art of making women happy. Now for your last test." Reeda leaned in, pressing her snout to my ear, her murmuring causing the hair on the back of my neck to stand on end. "You're riding a Ferris wheel with your girlfriend and you're about to reach the top. What do you do?"</p><p>There was no hesitation on my part. I turned her my head to face her and caught her lips with my own, locking her into an embrace just as we got an unhindered view of the bay and the Volcaldera skyline, our hands finding each other to hold one another in a tight embrace as Reeda leaned against me and pressing a hand against my chest. As much as I would have loved to carry that kiss along for another couple minutes, it was abruptly broken by the raptor, who left a parting bite and tug to my bottom lip.</p><p>"Congrats, dude. You're now the best boyfriend in the world and passed the test with flying colors." She cooed, her voice noticeably more husky. "And now you get to get to reap the benefits. Close your eyes." She commanded, pressing her hand more firmly against my chest, shoving my back against the side wall of the carriage we sat in.</p><p>"What, you gonna gift me a cassette you secretly made me?" I asked, pushing back against her, only to be shoved right back against the wall.</p><p>"Close. Your. Eyes." She walked her fingers up my chest with each methodical and commanding word, pressing a finger against my lips to silence me.</p><p>I gave a sigh and relented, Reeda then half-suppressing a laugh as hand gently dragged down my lips, my chin, my throat, chest, stomach an- wait. Was she really about t- OHGODOHFUCKOHGODOHFUCKOHGODOHFUCKITSHAPPENING. Her hand grabbed my groin to my horror and arousal. Right here? In public? On a Ferris wheel? Maybe it was a mistake. Any second now she'll probably move it to my thigh or- wait why is she rubbing my groin? Oh fuck... She's really going for it. And for some reason, my hands aren't trying to push her away.</p><p>My mind was swimming in all sorts of lewd images and thoughts while I was being toyed with, her hand sensually caressing me to the point I felt a stir in my loins, causing me to quickly go to half-mast, with a delighted "oh" coming from the raptor temptress. Her ministrations continued, her hand actively squeezing my concealed shaft and concentrating to pressure of her petting along the zipper. My breathing hitched the moment I realized her hand was now tearing at my jeans, the fly opening and the button being undone. As I opened my eyes, Reeda caught me and pried my eyelids right back down.</p><p>"No peeking." She snapped playfully, my scarousal keeping my eyes shut as I let her do what she wished.</p><p>"Are you sure you wanna do this? On the ride? We're gonna reach the bottom soon..."</p><p>"No one will know except the two of use, bro. That's why I pushed you back. No one will see anything except a cute couple..."</p><p>As I tried to interject, I was cut off by that familiar hand diving straight into my pants and right past my boxer briefs, seizing my manhood and giving it an affectionate squeeze.</p><p>"Daaaamn, bro. Where'd you get such a fat fuckin' cock? Is this all for me?" She pried, giving my rod a shake.</p><p>"Holyshitpleasestopbeinggross."</p><p>"Awh come on, Anon? Don't like it when your girlfriend compliments you?"</p><p>Bitch you know this is because you're jerking me off and saying nasty shit.</p><p>As I seethed about my predicament, Reeda moved on to straight up pumping my dick, her more delicate hands having a bit of fury to them as if she was performing an experiment to see how quick she could get me to blow my load. I could hear the idle chatter of other people as we reached what had to be the bottom of the ride, letting the wheel bring us past the other carnival goers waiting in line before we began going back upwards, the onslaught continuing as I tried my best to not drool all over myself. While in my lust-filled stupor, I could hear Reeda's tantalizing voice murmuring into my ear.</p><p>"You're so cute when you're trying not to nut. Just relax, Anon. You know you love this. Let it allllll out."</p><p>Her voice had a subtle hiss to it as she tried to goad me. Not only was she right in saying that, deep down, I was loving this, but her teasing was working. To my own chagrin, her voice alone, what with it's breathy pleas and tantalizing whispers, brought me more pleasure than it should have. Hell, she could probably just talk to me this way and she wouldn't even need to touch me to get what she wanted. Even while I sat there trying to not bust a nut, she just HAD to make things worse for me by breathing against my neck, her hot breath washing over my skin which gave me goosebumps all over and forced a shuddering breath out of me. Her body started to press against mine, her muzzle pressing into my throat and nipping my flesh like she was trying to sample her prey before going in for the kill. Her fist began pumping faster and faster as that tightening sensation in my groin grew, marking the point of no return. My breathing became labored, and Reeda sensed my impending climax, capitalizing on the opportunity afforded to her by sucking and licking my throat. Never really thought something like that would do things to me, but... Fucking hell it felt so nice. I could already tell she was going to leave behind a massive hickey, but that was the least of my concerns. Before I knew it, I let out a groan against my on volition and felt the walls come crumbling down, erupting from the ministrations of my new girlfriend. To make matters worse, Reeda had planned for this and she had pointed my rod up towards my own stomach to paint myself like a canvas. While my ears practically rang from the first load I ever blew without my own hands being involved, I could hear a chuckle from the raptor as she slowly unraveled her fingers from me and dropped my shirt back down over my stomach. After finally opening my eyes, I covered my shame and quickly closed up my pants, catching my breath as I began to ruminate on what had just happened.</p><p>"Snrk. Imagine nutting on yourself."</p><p>I punched her in the arm, which was met a devious cackle from the raptor before we hopped off the ride, my shirt sticking to my stomach which disgusted me to no end, like everyone knew what we did. Yet, at least to my knowledge, no one was aware of our doings just moments ago. I kept a hand on my neck, concealing the damp spot where a hickey was surely forming as we walked off, Reeda holding my other arm.</p><p>"Let's go back to your place, Anon. I'm not done with you yet."</p><p>My heart skipped a beat. "Shouldn't uh... Shouldn't you be going back home?" I asked.</p><p>"After you got me all turned on like that, dude?"</p><p>Come to think of it, she did seem to be walking funny. Like she was squeezing her legs together or something, on top of gripping my arm extremely tight. The walk was rather quick considering Reeda was basically dragging me back to my apartment, her death grip on my arm while she was mumbling to herself and making a lot of strange, needy noises. Like something was stressing her out. Probably her being horny. When we got home, she burst through the door, shoving me in and locked it behind us, then grabbing me by my shirt and aggressively slamming her lips against mine, ramming her tongue into my mouth and beginning to grind her pelvis against me while pouring heated breaths against my lips. As much as I wanted to participate, I really couldn't. Reeda was almost violent with me, like she was upset I made her horny some how. The makeout session was abruptly ended, leaving a thin strand of saliva bridging our bottom lips until it snapped.</p><p>"Go clean yourself up, Anon. Then get your ass back here."</p><p>Not wanting to keep my hot and bothered girlfriend waiting, I did just that. Jumping into the shower and scrubbing myself clean, I hopped right back out, wearing a tank top and sleeper pants and finding Reeda sitting on my bed and feeling up her chest, her thighs grinding together roughly even when she noticed me come out of the shower.</p><p>"Thank fuck, dude. I thought I was gonna die out here. Bed. NOW."</p><p>I won't lie, seeing Reeda suddenly become so aggressive and dominant was a turn on. Taking my seat, I watched as Reeda began to strip, first bending over and working off her pants which was a struggle when it got down to her bubble of an ass. When she managed to work them off, I was left staring at a pair of black panties that were clearly extremely damp, along with a large portion of her inner thighs. The moment those panties were dropped, there was a rather long spiderweb of moisture that connected them, which snapped when her panties reached somewhere just above her knees.</p><p>"Damn it, Anon. You fucking ruined 'em. I'm gonna fucking kill you, dude. You owe me a new pair when I'm done with you."</p><p>She tossed the now-ruined panties into the growing pile of clothing on the floor, then turning to face me as she removed her bra from under her shirt, a glimpse of one of her pierced nipples flashing me for but a moment. Fuck. I love nipple piercings. Before I could ogle more at those gloriously pierced nipples, Reeda's hand pressed against my chest and she shoved me down onto my back, my legs being brought up to my bed as Reeda clambered on. My waist was promptly mounted, and I readied myself for what was bound to be losing my virginity, the prospect of which both excited and scared me, as I didn't have experience before aside from getting jerked off about half an hour ago. That idea was quickly dashed however, as Reeda began to climb over me. Leaving a damp spot on my sleeper pants, she crawled on all fours, bringing herself further and further up, her chest passing my head. Rolling my eyes down, I realized what was going on. Her knees planted themselves on either side of my face, and I was staring up at that painfully aroused slit. This was arguably even more terrifying than just straight up getting laid. I never contemplated a situation where I would have my face sat on by a smoking hot stoner raptor babe! I'm so fucking unprepared!</p><p>"Uh- um, uhh R-Reeda I-"</p><p>That smell. Something about it seemed strange. While I had nothing in terms of one-to-one comparison, there were a few key subtleties that I began to pick up. It was rather pleasant, to say the least. At least it meant she was good at cleaning herself. It had a hint of some kind of floral scent, like she was wearing freshly washed clothing. Then there was that light musk. By no means was it a bad smell. It was just one of those smells people had that couldn't be scrubbed away. Like that smell of a t-shirt that had been worn all day that carried someone's very scent. Then a feint hint of sweat from the long day at the carnival, though not bearing the rancid or sour notes of someone unwashed. And then, there was the note of... something. I couldn't put my finger on it. All I know was that smell did something to me. Almost immediately I got a massive erection when I noticed it, like it was having some kind of physiological effect on me. I just couldn't get enough of it. Something about it was driving me up a wall and I just couldn't stop taking it in. Was this her pheromones? Was this her estrus season? My train of thought was interrupted by my vision growing darker as Reeda started to lower herself, the various scents growing stronger and stronger until it was all I could breath in once her slit met my lips.</p><p>"Stop. Talking. Dude." She commanded, her thighs squeezing the side of my head as she got some kind of pleasurable relief from her finding a seat on my face, only a liiiiiiiiiittle bit frustrated from the torture of her lack of release.</p><p>I had never felt so helpless before. Being pinned to the bed under the weight of my stoner girl friend while she literally sat on my face wasn't really something I planned on happening, yet here I was, being suffocated by raptor pussy and thighs. The pheromonal scent continued to wash my mind into a lust-addled haze, on top of the now present taste of her on my lips. I was simply left there, inhaling her scent, and unsure of what to do, with Reeda taking in labored, shuddering breaths as she sat there. I don't think I've ever seen her like this. Scratch that, I NEVER have. She was like a whole different person; a puppet possessed by some insatiable demon with an appetite for carnal pleasures. While lost in my thoughts, Reeda's hips began to roll in short strokes, smearing my mouth in her heady sap as she took out her disenchantment on me, my hands finding purchase on her thighs as I wore them like a pair of headphones. The rhythm of her movements remained steady as she rode my face, my struggled breaths coming out as muffled groans as she more or less suffocated me like she was performing some kind of interrogation. But even while she sat their, grinding her cunt against me, I could see, well, as best I could through the haze that clouded my vision, that she was still incredibly frustrated as the pleasure she received just wasn't enough to satisfy her.</p><p>"D-damn it, Anon." She growled. "Eat. Me. Out." Each word was capitalized with an aggressive grind of her hips, forcing her taste onto my tongue which paired well the with the pheromonal cloud that surrounded me.</p><p>Without much in the way of thought I dutifully obeyed her command and let out my tongue to lap at her dripping folds, which was met with a pleased groan and another roll of her hips. On top of that, a more raw taste of her secretions, which put my already fogging mind into a cascade of primal desires, my caveman brain screaming at me for more. Yet I literally have no idea what I'm actually doing so I just kept lapping away, using her continuous approving grunts as guidance as to whether or not I should keep working. The seconds turned to minutes, which ticked by so slowly that it felt like hours had passed, probably from the fact all I could really see aside from Reeda's cunt in my face was her reddened face as she huffed and groaned. Oh, and her sick thighs of course. Eventually I started to make the connection that her movements corresponded with her needs. So the hard she rode my face, the more aggressively I'd lap away at her aching folds. Yet still, she was only growing more and more frustrated, her eyes slammed shut and sweat dripping off her brow as she started riding harder, her thighs closing around my face in a tighter, vice-like grip with her hands grabbing the top of my head, fingers clawing at my scalp as she demanded more pleasure.</p><p>"Deeper... You fuck... Go deeper, dude." She hissed.</p><p>At this point she was starting to sound more furious at me than before, her hips grinding even harder, like she's trying to force me to devour her. Even my mattress is starting to move in the bed frame from her trying to get herself off on my tongue. At some point, I had to oblige her demand, and I figured it to be better sooner rather than later. Taking the plunge, I dive my tongue deep into her folds, as far as I can force it, which earned a suppressed moan from Reeda as she sank her teeth into her bottom lip, and her velvety inner walls clamping down as a surge of ecstasy surely ripped up her spine</p><p>"Fuuuuuck... Right there."</p><p>Yeah, that did the trick. And her motions surely echoed that theory as she began to let loose a set of raging bucks of her hips, the dampness coating my entire mouth, my nose, and my chin, more or less fucking herself on my own tongue as I tried my best to do whatever I could to help her out, whether it be flits and fans of my tongue or just straight up making out with her lower lips. To my own surprise, it was working as she nearly fell forward, forcing her hands to hold onto the headboard as she rocked her hips forcing my head to rock back with her as she more or less drowned me, sucking in deep breaths at any opportunity I had, which was growing far less frequently with the minutes ticking buy until she decided to just leave herself seated and just grind away at me until she either got her release, or was too frustrated to finish.</p><p>"C'mon... C'mon. Almost t-there... Fuckin'... Make me cum..."</p><p>As soon as I was thinking of a way to help her out, she took matters into her own hand. I could hear the feint scraping of her nails on the wooden headboard which made me only slightly concerned as to what was coming next. What made me more concerned was how her thighs still managed to squeeze my head, giving me a deep headache that was so sharp, it felt like my head was about to pop like a water balloon. Breathing was no longer an option at this point. As hard as I tried, she was squeezing the life out of me and drowning me in a haze of her pheromones and juices. I was beginning to understand why it was dinos acted so weird during estrus season. Something about the smells and tastes was so intoxicating. Like I just couldn't get enough of it and was easily sliding down the pit of addiction. With an outright, primal growl she slammed her hips down on my lips again... and again... and again... and again. I was almost scared I was about to die between her thighs, but honestly, I'd have welcomed it. With the not-so-dry humping and the amorous grinding, it was only a matter of time I passed out. I could only hope it was after her climax. The seconds ticked by and things only got rougher from there, to the point I could feel not only my tongue, but my lips go numb and my headache growing sharper as she rode my face into the mattress, my vision becoming more and more tunneled as my peripherals began to fade, the only thing being seen now was her strained face that was drenched in sweat from a mixture of arousal and stress. And just when I thought I was about to pass out, her words echoed out into the room as she let loose a guttural moan, unrestrained by shame. With waves and flutters, I was soaked in a torrent of her ejaculate, which stained my face and even my neck as she rode out her climax, looking down at me with an almost shocked looked on her face, like she couldn't believe what just happened. Thankfully, she noticed I was about to die, and she lifted herself off my face, placing herself on my chest while I labored for fresh air.</p><p>"You... You good... Anon?" She asked between pants, wiping the sweat off her forehead with her shirt and putting on a somewhat relieved smile.</p><p>I took a minute to properly catch my breath, speaking up only after I felt like I wasn't going to pass out anymore. "Y-yeah, I'm fine... Just thought I was about to meet Raptor Jesus for a moment... Fuck, dude. I thought you were trying to smother me to death. Can't even feel my face."</p><p>Reeda's face grew a tinge more red. "Yeah, sorry about that, bro. I didn't realize it was my estrus season already. Coulda sworn it wasn't for another week or two."</p><p>I waved my hand. "Don't... sweat it. I just need a nap is all."</p><p>Reeda shook her head, grinning widely. "Sorry, bro. But I ain't done with you yet."</p><p>"Excuse me, what?"</p><p>"It's estrus season, dude. We're going until I feel like I've had enough." She began scooting back down to my waist, almost immediately beginning to tug my sleeper pants to unleash my rock-hard pipe.</p><p>"Wh- wait, Reeda! I don't have any condoms!"</p><p>She cackled and yanked them all the way down, tossing my pants off to the side as she mounted me, then underbelly of my dick meeting her soaked nether region as she seated herself. "Anon, I doubt a skinnie could knock up someone other than another skinny. It'll be fine. Now let me see if what they say about skinnies is true." She remarked, rolling her hips to put down a thick layer of her natural lubricant on me, the tingling warmth enveloping me.</p><p>"Wh-what do they say?" I questioned, trying my best not to moan as she teased me.</p><p>"You're warm-blooded, right? I heard your cum is like, super warm. I wanna know if it's true." She focused her weight on my crown, my hands gripping her thighs as I strained to keep quiet.</p><p>Only a couple moments later, after more torturous teasing, Reeda raised herself and seized the base of my dick, aiming it straight at her primed mound and began to seat herself, both of our faces contorting into expressions of bliss. That was it: I was no longer a virgin. But if she were to just suddenly hop off and say "meh, don't feel like it anymore" no one could really count that. The moment of truth came when she lifted herself once more. I swear, it was almost like it was about to slip out. But instead, she SLAMMED herself right back down on me, a loud "CLAP" sounding out from the meaty smack as she began her second ride.</p><p>"Fuck, d-dude. You're so warm... I love it..."</p><p>A nice thing to hear right before being broken by a horny dino in the middle of her estrus. The pace was quickly picking up, her hands finding their place on my damp chest as she began scratching my chest gently, which I was sure wasn't going to last very long, seeing as how she was quickly working herself up. It almost seemed like when she got relief, it just served to guide her into an eventual frenzy.</p><p>These sensations I felt were completely alien to me. The way her velvety walls gripped and stroked me was unlike anything my own hand could do. Hell, her own hand felt way better than anything I could do. On top of that, there was the enveloping warmth that kept me riled up and desperate for more. Then there was the unrestrained view of her face, the way her eyes closed and her head tilted up as she let out various grunts, groans, and moans as she worked. Our bodies went through the motions, hers bouncing and riding, mine recoiling and flexing under her as she more or less had her way with me. I could even make out the bouncing of her ample chest under her flapping shirt, along with the occasional peek at her nipple piercings as they teased him with their shimmers and glints. At least I wouldn't have to be too embarrassed if I just let her do all the work, as she seemed more than capable of getting herself off with my equipment.</p><p>True to my prediction, it only took a couple of minutes before Reeda was acting just like the sex-crazed demon as before. Her nails were regularly raking against my chest as she slammed herself down with more and more sexual fury, red marks soon becoming visible with each passing swipe, becoming dangerously close to drawing blood. At that point, I was starting to groan in a mixture of pain and pleasure; a controversial, yet wonderful combination. The claps of our bodies grew louder, coming about with such an intensity, I was almost sure our neighbors could hear us. And my poor bed. The box-spring mattress was screaming and the wooden frame was creaking, surely beginning to knock some pegs or nails loose. I could've even sworn at some point I could feel my legs being dislocated from the sheer ferocity of the raptor.</p><p>But to my horror, I could feel that familiar sensation rearing it's ugly head. I was about to cum my fucking brains out right into some quality, raptor pussy. Fuck, not yet. Please! But no amount of pleading could change the inevitable. The only thing I could utter was just an obnoxiously loud grunt as I tried my best to mute myself by biting my tongue, as a torrent of cum began to paint her inner walls in alabaster goodness. The very first jet to hit her earned a pleased growl as she settled down, seating herself fully as her thighs squeezed my waist. As I emptied my payload with the last rounds, her eyes began to crack open, her gaze falling upon me like I was a piece of meat for her enjoyment as she leaned down to place a trail of kisses up my throat and off my lips, some of her own juices collecting itself on her lips. She licked her chops, sampling her own taste before she gave a throaty chuckle, placing her hands on the mattress on either side of my head.</p><p>"So it's true... It really is nice and hot. I want MORE."</p><p>I shrank into the mattress, suddenly becoming terrified of the monster I helped to create. She suddenly and violently took me in for a dominating kiss, cramming her tongue into my mouth and nearly causing me to choke on it. I could even hear those beastial- no, demonic growls as she savagely battered my tongue and tonsils with her own muscle, slithering it out of my mouth when she broke the kiss, nipping and tugging my bottom lip as she righted herself on my pelvis. My erotic horror was peaked when her long tail crept up to tickle my throat, only to then coil around it a couple times like some kind of fur-covered snake, where it gently began to constrict, closing off my windpipe ever so slightly.</p><p>"You're not leaving until I'm done with you, Anon. I hope you took ibuprofen earlier."</p><p>"I-... Didn't." I muttered, choked up slightly by her tail around my throat.</p><p>Reeda started to lift herself. "Shame."</p><p>Round 3 started off strong. Brutally strong. It was even more brutal than towards the end of round 2. I was sure this night was going to be the end of my bed, as the squeaks only grew louder. I could even feel myself sinking into the mattress so far I ended up hitting the board underneath, which really only just went to show how wild she was going. Mixed in with the furious bounces of her body, was periods of something more gentle, where she would take me down to the hilt and begin to gyrate her hips in an effort to milk every drop she could out of me, along with the clenches of those walls around me, showing she had some strong fucking kegels. The way she looked down at me only showed she knew what she was doing to me, like she was telepathically telling me "this is what you can look forward to". And once that time was up, she went back to brutally riding me, the soreness of my pelvis becoming more and more prevalent as she treated me like her own personal toy, not even caring if I need to be put into a cast after this.</p><p>The raptor's fury never stopped. At one point, as she clawed at my chest more, carving me up like a ham, my tank top was left in shreds, my chest now beginning to bleed as she did. With the next round of gyrations, her tail began to coil tighter, my windpipe closing, and my face surely turning brighter red as time went on. When she was finished clawing my chest, she began to lean forward once more, this time one of her hands catching itself on my face, her nails hooking into my cheek while the other fell onto my pillow, which was sure to not last long given what she did to my chest. And I was fearing the worst for my face as well. Thankfully, it would come out relatively intact.</p><p>The slamming only ramped up and my eyes started to water as I had to endure the fury of the raptor as she took me, her ass slamming so hard onto my waist that I was beginning to worry I would come out with a pelvis that was turned to dust from it all. Even my dick was starting to hurt. The constant friction, even with the natural lubricant she produced that mixed with my previous load, was starting to make it feel sore like a well worn muscle. Not bad considering I just lost my virginity only a couple minutes ago. And hell, I was even lasting longer than before despite what was happening to me.</p><p>Then, her tail constricted further. Now, I once again couldn't breath. Any cries of pleasure or pain came out as choked up rasps and breaths, my face feeling hot and my vision beginning to blur as I watched Reeda continue to abuse me so fervently, like the plaything I was to her. I couldn't handle it. I could practically feel not only my body, but my mind breaking from under her, like it was what she wanted all along. Like she was molding me into the perfect person to please her. My head was growing light, and my vision was turning into distant pinpricks, yet I could still feel everything with the utmost detail. The warmth of her, the constant eddies of bliss and surges of pain, it was all so vivid and surreal. I must have been dreaming this entire time. Surely, I would find out soon enough.</p><p>And with luck on my side, I would. I could feel that sensation once more. Like on the Ferris wheel and during round two. I was about to dump another load into her just like she wanted. My eyes managed to shoot open and my body writhed under her, the look on Reeda's face turning into a devilish grin as she knew what was to come. With a final squeeze of her tail around my throat, she leaned back on her hands, showing off those gyrations with an unhindered view of her stirring my rod around inside her, a distinct bump in her flesh forming that contrasted with her normally flat abdomen.</p><p>"C'mon, Anon. I know you have it in you. Give me what I want. Give it ALL to me."</p><p>Her voice somehow sounded even more lurid as she continued the gyrations, still trying to milk me for all I was worth. However much I was worth I didn't and probably couldn't know. All I knew was I had something she wanted, which I gave to her in abundance. The final climax was powerful enough, that I felt my body seize and my teeth grit as I continued to choke loudly and desperately, finally reaching the most powerful climax to date. And with Reeda's approving moan, she settled herself down, resorting to simply massaging my rod with her inner walls, letting herself be filled to the brim, to the point there was the beginnings of some spillage seeping out from between us. Finally, her tail loosened so I could breathe, but remained loosely wrapped around my neck like a feather boa.</p><p>"Fuuuuck, Anon. You were just what I needed. No homo, right?" She asked, calming herself down to something a bit less terrifying as she remained seated on my dick.</p><p>"N-no homo." I replied hoarsely.</p><p>"Alright, I think I got another dozen in me left. Ready, Anon?" She asked, beginning to lightly bounce herself on my waist once again.</p><p>Sweet Raptor Jesus, this is gonna be a long night.</p><p>...</p><p>I don't think I had ever been used like that before. Come to think of it, I never was. The night was filled with far more than I could have ever hoped for, and filled with positions I didn't even know actually existed. I could remember it all so vividly like I was watching a recording. I even distinctly remember getting folded in half at some point. After waking up, I heard the sound of retching in the bathroom, which, considering I was in my bed by myself, I could only assume was Reeda.</p><p>Probably nothing...</p>
