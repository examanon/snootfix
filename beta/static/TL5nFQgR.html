<h1>Ending 1.5 Chapter 4</h1><div><p>Chapter 4: The Return</p><p>​</p><p>A jumble of yawns, stretches and moans accompany the next morning's alarm, the soft music from Fang's phone a welcome alternative to the screeching of my clock, despite being earlier than normal. Fang got up first, showering and getting ready while I laid in bed, mapping out the day ahead. Naser and Naomi should be out of the way, same with Trish and Reed. The latter may try to talk to me, but I can live with that as long as they do what Fang asked. After that, we've got the weekend to get everything in order. And if things go south… no, things won't go south.</p><p>After she's done, I do my own round of getting ready. Emerging from the bathroom, I see Fang sitting on the bed and looking down, stricken with terror at something in her hand. I peer over, but she hides it before I can figure out what it is. I take a seat beside her and give a questioning look. Fear and shame lurk in her eyes as she clenches the object.</p><p>Her hand opens, revealing a small black cylinder with a series of six round holes around the flat side of it. Each one about the size of a bullet.</p><p>Another reminder.</p><p>Slowly, I reach over, covering her hand and the speed loader with mine. She trembles as I take it away, leaving it in a drawer next to the first reminder.</p><p>"I'm scared," she whispers as I sit back down. "There's so much that can go wrong. Too much." Verbal responses failing me, I pull her into a hug. What is there to say? Even if she is planning on deviating, it's too late to change course now. We just need to power through it.</p><p>The display on the desk clock clicks over, warning of tardiness if we wait much longer. It's such a small thing, but ignoring it will only make the day that much worse. I take her hand and stand up, offering to pull her up with me.</p><p>"Let's go, Fang," I say. "I promise, today is going to be fine." She rises, her eyes protesting what her mouth doesn't. "I have the utmost confidence in you. I wouldn't be asking this if I thought it could go wrong."</p><p>She nods, but there's an uncertainty in it. We pick up our stuff and leave the apartment, and Fang lights a cigarette as soon as we clear the building. After a few long drags as we're walking, it's reduced to nothing more than filter and ember.</p><p>"You got enough of those left to make do?" I ask.</p><p>"A fucking nicotine IV won't be enough if I have to deal with Naomi," she replies.</p><p>"You won't have to worry about that."</p><p>"About that. What exactly did you do to keep her out of my business?"</p><p>"I… uh…" I mentally replay my conversation with Naomi the day prior. "... asked nicely…" The glare Fang shoots me says that won't be anywhere close to enough. "I've got her in first period, I'll take care of it then. Promise."</p><p>Begrudgingly accepting this, we continue walking, but the exchange sticks in my mind. If she really is thinking about Naomi the same way she was a few days ago, that can only end catastrophically. Not to give Ripley credit, but maybe that talk about seeing a professional should come sooner rather than later.</p><p>We come upon the fog-shrouded school and part ways to our first classes. Being separated from Fang already lowered my spirits, and Naomi seating herself in the desk next to me sent me straight to the bottom. The moment she turned to me and opened her mouth, I knew I was going to hate every second of this. I almost can't blame Fang…</p><p>"So, Anon. Finals are next week. Are you feeling prepared?" Her voice feels like a buzz saw to the skull and I have to force myself to remain calm.</p><p>"As ready as I'll ever be," I reply.</p><p>"You know, you and Fang have missed some important lectures this week. If you need some extra study partners, Naser and I will be glad to help." I have no idea how much of this is a genuine offer of help and how much is another attempt at manipulation, but my answer is the same, regardless.</p><p>"That won't be necessary. We have it handled."</p><p>"Well, I'm sure you won't mind if I ask Fang for a second opinion."</p><p>"I would… advise against doing that," I strain, struggling to maintain my composure.</p><p>"Why? We've worked on major projects together before. A couple of study sessions will be a breeze." Good God, I need an out before this moron gets herself killed, but what? Asking nicely isn't working worth jack shit, but I can't just come out and tell her that Fang genuinely wants her fucking dead. Come on, think. There has to be a way her manipulative side bites her in her stupid orange ass. What if I got Naser to keep her away, or… wait...</p><p>"Naomi… I'm going to be blunt. If you say even a single word to Fang, I'll tell Naser about all the shit you've been doing to us this semester. Including everything you said when you went off on me on prom night."</p><p>Her eye twitches but her fake smile remains, and she shifts back to facing towards the front of the class. While she doesn't give me a response, the sight of her tail curling in silent rage tells me I hit the mark. Sweet, sweet catharsis at finally getting one over her. Maybe I should tell Naser about that shit anyway; he deserves better, after all. It will have to wait, though.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>While first period went by well after my successful interaction with Naomi, and second was fine enough, third was utter hell. Fang and Naomi were in the same room for the first time since I spilled the beans during our fight, and there was absolutely nothing I could do except wait and pray. Stomach knotted, heart racing, legs restless, obsessively checking my phone in case I got an emergency text. Naomi might think I was bluffing, or that my threat was empty, or a million other things that all end in ways I dared not imagine.</p><p>Not even the ring of the bell calmed me down as I rushed to fourth period to finally see Fang again. As the minutes tick down to the start of the period, the seat next to me remains empty. It’s fine, it’s not rare for fang to be a little late to classes, if anything went wrong I would’ve heard about it by now.</p><p>These reassurances don’t stop me from taking out my phone and sending a quick ‘Are you okay?’ to her. An affirmative response a few moments later finally puts me on the path of calm. No disasters yet, and with any luck, it will stay that way. I catch myself counting the seconds as they come and go, anxiety replaced with anticipation. Half a day down, another half to go. If we can get through this first one, the next ten will only get easier.</p><p>“Hey,” a voice calls from behind me, pulling me out of my trance. Sure, I knew she was okay - she said so herself - but seeing her in person finally put my fears to rest.</p><p>“Hey,” I respond, unable or unwilling to voice the emotional turmoil I was trapped in earlier. Not that Fang had it any better.</p><p>“I would’ve been here sooner, but I, uh…” She holds up her hands, showing me the gauze wrapped around her palms, lightly stained red. “...clenched my fists a little too hard.”</p><p>“Did Naomi say anything to you?”</p><p>“No, my claws wouldn’t have been in my palms if she had.” She flashes a small smirk, but I can see the pain behind it. There goes any hope of a peaceful resolution. Fang and Naomi are locked in a cold war, and the former has ten nuclear warheads on her fingertips, ready to launch at a moment’s notice. “Hell, she didn’t even look at me. What did you do? And don’t say you ‘asked nicely’ because I know that’s bullshit.”</p><p>“Ah, well, I may have threatened her with going to Naser if she tried anything. Glad to see it actually worked, and it might keep her away through the end of the year. One problem solved.”</p><p>“Yeah, only a thousand more to go,” she sighs. Ever the pessimist.</p><p>Fang elbows me in the side. Mumbling, give me a fucking break, please.</p><p>I never thought I would have found myself wishing that science class would last longer, yet the bell rings and I’m thrust into the triceratop’s den. My hopes for a long, dull lecture were dashed part way through when a stack of paper was passed around the class. More busywork means I should be expecting something from Trish right... about…</p><p>Something bounces off the back of my head. Now. I glance behind me towards the remaining members of VVURM DRAMA. Reed is sporting an uneasy smile and Trish… I can sense the anger pouring out of her from here. I could always just ignore them. It’s not like Trish has anything useful to say, and the chances of her listening to me are somewhere between slim and none. But… if it worked for Naomi, maybe it can work for her.</p><p>Just answer her questions the best you can and don’t get into an argument. She’s still Fang’s friend. I walk over and take a seat across from Trish. Before I can even get my ass in the chair, Trish begins.</p><p>“How is Fang doing, Anon?” she asks.</p><p>“Why don’t you ask them?” I retort, my tone fatigued. Please let this end quickly.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be asking you if I tried that, jackass. They’ve been ignoring and dodging the question, and it’s unlike anything I’ve seen from them before. So I’m asking you.”</p><p>“If they’re not ready to tell you, then why would I?”</p><p>“Because-!” She sighs frustratedly. “Alright, fine. How are you doing, Anon?” Good progress?</p><p>“I’ve been better. It’s been a long week.”</p><p>“Yeah, I get it. Dealing with Fang must be pretty difficult.” What the fuck?</p><p>“I- what?” I choke. There’s a glint of malice in her eyes. Collect yourself. Don’t fall for it. “No, Fang isn’t the issue, it’s everyone refusing to give them space.”</p><p>“Right, right. Everyone needs to give them some space. Except you, of course. Why is that?”</p><p>“Well, that’s… that’s their choice to make.”</p><p>“I see. You want to know what I think?”</p><p>“Not really.” She ignores me, in complete control of the conversation.</p><p>“I think, some time last weekend, you fucked up. Really badly. I’m giving you the chance to come clean right now. Maybe we can come to an understanding.” Her mouth curves into a sadistic grin. I’m right where she wants me, aren’t I? I can’t tell her anything. Who knows what Trish would try to put me through if she found out the truth.</p><p>“I don’t know what to tell you. It’s not really my place to say what you want to hear. If Fang wants to include you in this, then they will.” Her eyes narrow and she lightly huffs.</p><p>“I dunno, Trish…” Reed speaks up for the first time. “He kinda, like… has a point. You wouldn’t want me sayin’ all your private stuff just cause someone asked, right?” The upset triceratops side-eyes him, but doesn’t follow up with a response.</p><p>“I’ve known Fang for ten years. You haven’t even known them for ten months,” she fumes at me. “This is the first time they’ve ever kept a secret from me, and it’s not a coincidence that you’re involved.” She crosses her arms and leans back in the chair, glaring at me. I don’t bother with a response; there’s simply no point. I blink and her frown shifts into a smile. “This was actually very useful, Anon. Thank you. Fuck off, now.”</p><p>With pleasure. I return to my seat and try to distract myself with the classwork. Raptor Jesus, what a waste of time. Just like every other time I’ve bothered to extend an olive branch to that purple bitch. Oh well, at least nobody can say I didn’t try.</p><p>The last bell of the day rings, signalling an end to today’s torture sessions. There’s one last thing I need to take care of, and then it’s a weekend with Fang. Granted, I wouldn’t mind if the situation were a bit… brighter, but that’s life. Studying, tests, dealing with everyone trying to get into our business, graduation, and then things will finally calm down a bit.</p><p>I push my way through the main entrance and spot Fang off to the side of the bottom of the staircase. I catch up to her and she grabs my wrist.</p><p>“Thank fuck, let’s get out of here,” she says, yanking me along.</p><p>“Wait, wait, just a second,” I respond, pulling my arm back.</p><p>“The fuck for?!”</p><p>“Just- just trust me, this will only take a minute.” I scan the courtyard and find the track team captain pushing his way through the crowd, a large black case in one of his hands. Fang must see him too, as I can feel her fidgeting, trying to coax me away. I twist my hand around and grab hers, our fingers intertwining. Shit, I didn’t consider that Naser might try to talk to Fang. Fucking hell, the fact that I’m worried about something that innocent…</p><p>“Here you go, Anon,” Naser says, handing me the guitar case. “You two have a good weekend.” He nods and then walks off. Well, that went better than expected.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go,” I say, turning down the sidewalk towards my apartment.</p><p>“Wait, is that, um… one of mine?” Fang asks, staring at the case in my hand.</p><p>“Yeah, I figured we could use something to do over the weekend.” I give her a reassuring smile.</p><p>“I… fucking hell, at least warn me next time.” She takes out a cigarette and lights it. “Shit, I’m almost out.” Her drags are long and deep, quickly taking in the stick’s nicotine supply.</p><p>“Maybe you should take it easy on those.”</p><p>“Tell me that after graduation. In the meantime, eat a dick.”</p><p>“Jeez, alright. Need to go to the grocer’s anyway...”</p><p>After we dropped off the guitar at my apartment, we went to a nearby grocery store. Bread, milk, menthol cigarettes, a concerning amount of chicken nuggets, and some rather expensive barbecue sauce. Should keep some of that in mind.</p><p>“Fffffffffuck,” Fang groans after collapsing onto the bed. “Gotta do that ten more fucking times.” She buries her head underneath the pillow, groaning again. I sit down and place a comforting hand on her back.</p><p>“First time was gonna be the hardest. It’ll only get easier from here.”</p><p>“It’s not just that…” she starts, voice muffled. “What about after? Dad knows our secret, and Naomi isn’t going to vanish, especially with how she’s conjoined with Naser.” Well, she might not enjoy hearing this, but now sounds as good a time as any…</p><p>“Wait,” she says, rolling over and clutching the pillow to her chest. Oh shit- “You could totally break up Naser and Naomi.”</p><p>“What? I mean… yeah, I guess?”</p><p>“You guess? You told me exactly what you’d do if she talked to me at school. Just do that after school is over, and that’s one less issue to deal with.” Not really what I had in mind. “Then what did you have in mind?”</p><p>And I said that out loud. She’s looking at me with an expectant smile that tells me this might not be so bad. I was planning on it anyway, so what’s the worst that can happen? I push away the memories of what happened barely a week ago - it’s not like that this time.</p><p>“Well, I was just thinking that, when we’re done with school and have a bit more free time, that we could… see someone. About all of this.” That smile I depended on to get those words out vanishes in an instant, replaced with an intense scowl. She throws the pillow at me and leaps to her feet, then turns her back to me and crosses her arms. A horrible silence cloaks us as I scramble to think of something to dial it back.</p><p>“I-”</p><p>“Dad put you up to this, didn’t he?” she accuses, still facing away. What was I thinking? This never had a chance of success.</p><p>“He… asked me to ask you. But we don’t have to include-”</p><p>“No, Anon! Just... no. I’m finally on the verge of having some control over my own goddamn life. I’m not going to throw that away so I can get medicated by some fucking shrink paid for by daddy’s money. I don’t need any of that bullshit.” She turns her head a bit, one eye scanning me.</p><p>She deflates, distress filling her voice. “I share my life with you because I love you, Anon. But that’s what it is - sharing. I don’t control you, and you don’t control me. But if you try to wrangle me into anything like that - especially if my dad is involved - then I’ll… go live my life somewhere else. Away from Naomi, and dad, and… and you, if I have to.”</p><p>“I understand. I was just asking. We can… figure something else out.”</p><p>“You mean like… breaking up Naser and Naomi?” Fang asks, sitting back down.</p><p>“I’ll… keep that in mind.” I really don’t want to get this involved in manipulation games, but it would help Fang out, and Naser deserves better…</p><p>The soft strumming of an acoustic guitar wafts through the air, accompanied by a quiet, rhythmic thumping. I fail to pick out the intricacies in Fang’s playing as my mind spools up, electing to simply lay and listen. We didn’t get much done yesterday, as I wasn’t feeling particularly confident in my ability to push any more ideas, even if it was just for studying. Things seemed to cool down, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I should actually do something instead of just agreeing with her. I mean, when was the last time we went on an actual date?</p><p>When we were searching for a venue? That barely counted. The museum? That was a wash and half, and I ditched early like a jackass. Prom? What the fuck, no. Have we even tried outside of that…?</p><p>...</p><p>‘How about we actually do something fun now?’ I asked after a rough day at school. Naser had beat the shit out of me earlier that day, aggravating my somewhat fresh wounds after I was knocked down the stairs a couple days beforehand, and then apologized by mumbling about nothing in particular a few hours later.</p><p>‘Sure. Like what?’ Fang replied, excited after being stuck in my apartment all day with just her phone.</p><p>‘We could play some party games or something,’ I offered.</p><p>‘... Oh…’ Fang’s enthusiasm vanished completely. Wait, did I do something wrong?</p><p>‘Can be something else if you want.’ No, I asked...</p><p>‘I just thought you were going to say we should go out somewhere or something…’ Yeah, that would’ve been a good idea...</p><p>‘Er, I’m trying to save money for a new game that comes out in a few weeks, so…’</p><p>‘That’s alright.’</p><p>“FUCK!” I shout, snapping upright. Fang flinches, a discordant twang echoing from the guitar.</p><p>"What?! Are you okay?" she panics.</p><p>"I- uh wait- yeah, I'm fine, just…" I rub my temple, failing to soothe the pain of the mental lightning bolt that just blasted me to pieces. "Just remembered something embarrassing… on a completely unrelated note, we should go on a date. Like, right now."</p><p>"Oh? Where to?"</p><p>"To… uh…" Wow, I really did not think this one through. Surely I can come up with something…</p><p>"It's still morning, you know," Fang says. "You’ve got time to think it over." The shame I have brought upon myself will only increase with time.</p><p>"Nah, I got a great idea. Let's go to…" I sound out a couple of random consonants, scrambling to think of something. "D… Dino… Dino-Moe's! Yeah, there."</p><p>"Again?" she smirks, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>"Come on, it's been like three months, and the food is good… and your uncle is nice…" And it's free…</p><p>"Heard that, cheapskate. But… I'm not saying no. Are you sure you want to go now, though? It's… not even noon."</p><p>"I never thought you'd be the one to say no to pizza for lunch."</p><p>"Well, when you put it that way, fuck you, let's go."</p><p>Shower, clothes, walk, bus, walk again, holy shit when did it get so hot out, and here we are - Dino-Moe's Pizza and Pasta, with no time limit and nothing distracting to deal with. Just Fang and I enjoying ourselves. Really should do this more often.</p><p>"Welcome to Dino-Moe's. Table for two?" the waitress at the front offers.</p><p>"Actually, we're just here to see the manager," Fang replies. The waitress walks off into the restaurant. Hey, if it worked last time…</p><p>"AYYYY!" bellows a voice from afar. The stocky tyrannosaurus waddles into view. "If it ain't my favorite partners. Ya’ here strictly for business reasons, right?"</p><p>"Uh… we're… on a date," I sputter quietly. We've been dating for months, why am I so flustered?</p><p>"Oh ho ho, well! Color me surprised," he chuckles. "Ya got a reservation?" A… oh… oh no…</p><p>A belly laugh interrupts my spiral into self-derision. "I'm jus’ messing wit' ya, lighten up a bit, hehehe. C’mere, let's get you two's a table." He hooks his little arms around ours and drags us to a secluded area of the establishment, lighting a candle in the middle of our table with a comically long lighter. "Would’a been a lot moodier had ya come a few hours lata’, but what can ya do? The use'?" We nod and he gives us a tiny thumbs up, then heads back into the kitchen.</p><p>"Oh, man…" I sigh. "Always something with that guy, huh?" I say to Fang.</p><p>"You tell me. You looked like you were gonna shit yourself when he said 'reservation'."</p><p>"I bet you weren't much better."</p><p>"Pfft. I knew he was just messing around, and you can't prove otherwise," she brags.</p><p>"I could always ask."</p><p>"You'll find your plate perpetually empty if you do." I chuckle in response, but that smug expression tells me I'm better off keeping my mouth shut. "So. What was that embarrassing thing you remembered that in no way influenced your decision to come here?"</p><p>"Oh, well, uh…" I tentatively relay that horrific memory from earlier, with a large helping of apologies and begs for forgiveness mixed in. God, what was I thinking?</p><p>"I see…" Fang hums, mulling over my mistake. "Well, how was the game?" How was Gravelpunk 201M2077? That mini-game where you picked fleas out of a fellow ape’s back turned out to be an allegory for the entire game…</p><p>"I would've rather spent that money on you."</p><p>"Aww, how sweet. Also, you shouldn't have told me all that, cause I'm definitely going to hold that over you the next time I want something."</p><p>"Eh, it's the least I deserve."</p><p>"SOMEBODY ORDER A FUCKIN' PIZZA?" The shout from behind me shocks me out of my internal cringing, and a huge pizza is slid in between Fang and I. "Moe’s Original Meateor Pizza, cooked to perfection," Moe boasts.</p><p>"Now, befo’ ya give yourselves heart disease, I got somethin’ ta ask of ya," he says, lowering his voice to something more reasonable. "Eva’ since that show back in February, I've gotten a few requests to hold more of ‘em. Maybe when ya wrap up that whole school thing, you and ya friends would be willin’ to do some more of ‘em? Don't gotta decide now, just lettin’ ya know the offer is there. Alright, I'll get out of ya hair. At least, one of ya’s hair." He slaps his belly and guffaws, then returns to the kitchen.</p><p>I look back to Fang, and there's a complicated expression on her face. She idly takes a slice onto her plate, her eyes bouncing around as she works through the possibilities of such an offer. The fact she isn't saying 'no' is… interesting.</p><p>"So…" I mutter. "Upgrading from a high school band to a garage band?" That gets a smile, uneasy as it is.</p><p>"I… man, I don't know…" She rests her head on her palm, lazily taking a bite of pizza. "Like… could be cool, but… ugh, I'm just worried…" About another shitshow?</p><p>The death glare I get tells me I said that out loud. Damnit, I didn't mean it like that fucking fuck-</p><p>"You're not… entirely wrong," she sighs. "I'm more worried about Trish. Specifically, you and Trish." Oh, right. "Like yeah, you're kind of a fucking idiot sometimes, but we've all made dumb mistakes." Her voice drops to a whisper. "Some… dumber than others…"</p><p>Her eyes unfocus for a bit, then she groans in frustration. "I just want you two to get along. You're both close to me. I don't want to have to choose when I get to spend time with either of you. And… it's not your fault or anything. I mean, I made you apologize for something she did to you, and she still probably hates your guts."</p><p>"Not probably," I interject. "We talked yesterday. Well, 'talked', which means I listened while she berated me."</p><p>"About what?"</p><p>"She wants to know our secret and is pissed we aren't telling her. Said some weird shit, too. I'm pretty sure she was trying to bait me into saying something retarded."</p><p>"Didn't know you needed to be baited into that," she chuckles. "Still, that's… not great. I really don't want to keep you away from us just because she isn't cooperating. Damnit, why does playing music have to be so complicated… like I don’t expect you two to get all lovey dovey or anything, but I really need her to cool off around you."</p><p>"Yeah, I'm kinda worried she's going to do something ridiculous again. I mean, if she thought I was pulling you apart back in March, I can't imagine what she's thinking now."</p><p>"She doesn't think I'm doing this because I want to?"</p><p>"That's what I said, but I don't think she listened. Like, I get she's concerned, but if it's not her business, then it's not her business."</p><p>"God damnit… I'll have to talk to her about this. Maybe after finals."</p><p>"You could tell her that if she wants her show, she needs to be nice to me." Fang looks at me like I'm the stupidest person alive.</p><p>"No. I will not set up terms and conditions for my damn friendships. Besides, even if that did work, it'd only work once. I just… I don't know. I've got a week to figure it out, I guess."</p><p>The conversation dies down after that, leaving us with pizza and small talk. We have all manner of tests next week and it's important we pass them, unlike Spear's midterms from earlier in the year. Lots of studying lay ahead, and hopefully not much else.</p></div>
