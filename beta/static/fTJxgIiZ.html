You'll beat me someday"</p><p>"Maybe" he added with a chortle.</p><p>He followed that by taking a swig of his drink.</p><p>Ah, that's right Ridley caught on to my mumbling.</p><p>I had forgotten that. Actually now that I think about it, a lot of the people in my life caught on to it.</p><p>My secret exposed, hidden knowledge forever gone.</p><p>Felt nice.</p><p>"Getting your ass kicked feels nice, bro?</p><p>Reed takes a huge handful of his loaded fries and stuffs them into his mouth.</p><p>He actually used his hand for that.</p><p>"Something about getting used to it maybe, like a fetish" Nasar quips.</p><p>That gets a chuckle out of the room.</p><p>All 4 of us were sitting around the dinner table eating food and playing connect 4. Waiting on whatever it was to start.</p><p>"So run this by me again" I asked. </p><p>I popped a chip in my mouth. </p><p>"Why do we need to be here and our other halves elsewhere?"</p><p>"Because that's how it's done, always has been probably always will be" Naser decreed.</p><p>"Right but like, what exactly happens?" Reed still had food in his mouth</p><p>"I don't see the big deal, it's just another night" I said aloud</p><p>Ridley and Naser looked at each other for a moment.</p><p>"It's...better you find out on your own" Ridley shifted in his seat.</p><p>"Trying to explain it never really works out"</p><p>He looked very uncomfortable talking about this</p><p>"Look son, just go with the flow."</p><p>That last part seemed more like a command.</p><p>I opened my mouth to protest when a door opened</p><p>"Oh dear let them wonder some more, it's a special night after all."</p><p>The matriarch herself enters, with more food and drink.</p><p>Weird, she also mallet on the tray.</p><p>Must be for some meal prep.</p><p>"Anon, did you take your medicine yet?"</p><p>As she sets down the tray I fumble with the pill bottle in my jacket pocket. </p><p>"Oh right, I should probably get on that." I look at the label.</p><p>"Better take it now, your doctor did say about an hour beforehand."</p><p>Her smile was bright, still able to get what she wanted.</p><p>"right"</p><p>I open the bottle and pull out a pill. It was a rather large pill. </p><p>An hour before what though, like I get the general idea of what happens. Sexy time with Fang. Big deal.</p><p>We've been married almost a year now so I know how to handle her. Everyone is making such a fuss like it's our wedding night.</p><p>My face warms a bit from that memory. I don't think anyone noticed. I hope not.</p><p>Thinking back on it, this was our first time together for this holiday though. Back in high school I wasn't allowed to see her and during my college years she made sure I never visited around now.</p><p>Hell, even my doctor was being weird. Fang had told me to go get checked over to make sure I was healthy and all that. </p><p>So I went. My doctor was a strong built ankylosaur. Nice shade of yellow on her scales.</p><p>When I asked about Estrus Season she was evasive, something about how it should be felt and not told or other such bullshit.</p><p>After all the poking and prodding was done she handed me the medicine. </p><p>"Take this about an hour before, with food".</p><p>Then more sternly.</p><p>"Don't forget, bad things could happen else".</p><p>I remember looking at her with a skeptical face.</p><p>"Else what?"</p><p>She just shook her head.</p><p>"Fine then, what's in it?".</p><p>She then proceeded to rattle off names with more syllables than should be legal and finally ended with.</p><p>"Humans don't have an estrus season, so your body won't be able to handle it without this".</p><p>She looks me straight in the eye.</p><p>"Do not Forget."</p><p>I could only nod. </p><p>"Good, now go enjoy the night".</p><p>She had such a shit eating grin about it too.</p><p>"That pill is huge" Reed commented.</p><p>Taking me right out of memory lane.</p><p>"Yea, it must be nice not to have to take it." Looking at the clock it was still a few minutes before 11, but I don't think it needed to be on the dot.</p><p>Water, pill, and down it went.</p><p>Reed shrugged, it was his first time too in this. Somehow he had managed to avoid romance for most of his years and just "vibe with the world", his words not mine.</p><p>It wasn't until he and Trish got together about last year that changed. Turns out they made a pretty healthy couple, if you can believe it. </p><p>Trish initiated it I think, grabbed him by the neck and kissed him one night we were all hanging out. I was so surprised I thought she was trying to eat him.</p><p>In a way she was.</p><p>I think they might have always had a thing for each other. </p><p>The things that happen in life can be amazing, I ponder.</p><p>"Have you heard anything from Lucy, Anon?" Naser was checking his own phone while asking</p><p>"Not yet" I reply, looking at my own.</p><p>Reed does the same.</p><p>"Nothing from Trish".</p><p>"Oh don't worry boys, they have things that need to be taken care of." Samantha reassured us.</p><p>And to kill any further questions she added.</p><p>"Lady things that need addressing".</p><p>Samantha moved around the table, cleaning up trash and clearing dishes.</p><p>I moved to help but she waved me down.</p><p>"I got it dear".</p><p>A saint as always, the way everyone was talking it seemed like all the females would be going crazy tonight.</p><p>"Oh as you get older you don't get as wild" She looked my way.</p><p>Mumbling you betrayed me again.</p><p>I noticed Ridley shifted in his seat when she said that last part.</p><p>Was that relief on his face?</p><p>Just then the grandfather clock chimed 11 PM.</p><p>Everyone looked up.</p><p>Big old thing, I remember seeing it when I first came by Fang's house, all those years ago.</p><p>"Time to get going" Naser said</p><p>He got out of his seat, everyone else followed suit.</p><p>As we made for the door Ridley cleared his throat.</p><p>"Alright then, everyone be safe and don't do anything stupid".</p><p>He looked my way and put his hand on my shoulder.</p><p>"Anon, you may be married to my daughter but if I hear bad things from her, your ass is still mine". His grip tightened.</p><p>Some things never change.</p><p>"Right" I coughed out.</p><p>Damn his talons still hurt like hell.</p><p>"Come one, let's go, if we take too long...".</p><p>Naser trailed off.</p><p>"He's right boys, get going. It's not polite to keep ladies waiting".</p><p>Samantha started to shepherd us out the door.</p><p>It was then that I noticed her face was red, and her neck too.</p><p>She seemed to catch my concerned look.</p><p>"Come on now, get out".</p><p>She said that with some pretty heavy oomph.</p><p>Her eyes were... sharp, very focused.</p><p>Like a hunter being interrupted during her kill.</p><p>Ridley turned toward her with a look of fear.</p><p>The last thing I saw before she shut the door was the mallet in her hands.</p><p>The last thing I heard was the sound of the lock on the door going into place.</p><p>The last thing I felt was vibrations, of something heavy running. Followed by something lighter chasing.</p><p>That was....concerning.</p><p>Why the mallet?</p><p>As if reading my mind Naser spoke up not even turning his head</p><p>"Let's go and don't worry about it. Dad can handle himself".</p><p>He was very calm about this, even though I feel like I would get a little sick from the thought of my folks going at it.</p><p>He started walking and Reed looked at me.</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>With that we followed him to the Nascar, not saying anything. Once we hopped in he started out the driveway.</p><p>I think I just heard a door slam somewhere in the house.</p><p>Then again maybe not.</p><p>Naser pulls onto the road and takes off at his usual speed.</p><p>It was then I noticed his phone started buzzing.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>We've been driving for about 20 minutes at this point.</p><p>Other than Nasers phone vibrating the entire time not much was said.</p><p>"Bro, aren't you going to pick that up" Reed asked eventually.</p><p>Naser shook his head.</p><p>"I know who's calling".</p><p>Makes one of us at least.</p><p>He looked at us from his rear view mirror.</p><p>"My girlfriend," He finally said.</p><p>"Are you guys fighting then?"  Reed fumbled with his own phone.</p><p>"We're fine, she's just... in a mood. Because of tonight you know".</p><p>I didn't.</p><p>Reed's phone suddenly rang, he had a song from the old band as a ringtone, Cute.</p><p>They still jam together every now and then. They have gotten a lot better too.</p><p>He answered it.</p><p>"Trish hey....no we are on the way...yea I-.... yea sure. Uh Anon is here too".</p><p>I could only hear her tone and not the actual words, but she seemed normal enough.</p><p>Same old loud Trish.</p><p>"....Ok see you soon. Love you too" Reed said that last part a little quieter. Then ended the call.</p><p>Awww, to be in love.</p><p>"Everything good?" I asked.</p><p>Reed looked at me and shrugged.</p><p>"Yea, she just wanted to know where we were and stuff"</p><p>Just then my phone started ringing. I checked the caller. It was Fang...</p><p>Did my heart just skip a beat?</p><p>I answered, "Hey Fang what's up?"</p><p>"Just checking to make sure you're on your way," She said.</p><p>Holy fuck was her voice always this sweet?</p><p>"You picked up that box of condoms right?"</p><p>We had stopped by the gas station on the way home. She wanted me to pick up a big box.</p><p>"Yea I have them. Are you feeling ok?" I ask.</p><p>"Do you mean if I'm some sex crazed maniac?" she nearly laughed.</p><p>The thought had crossed my mind.</p><p>"I'm fine, hurry up and get home it's almost midnight."</p><p>Fang sounded normal just like Trish.</p><p>"We'll be there in a few minutes" I looked out the window to see where we were.</p><p>Was my palm getting sweaty?</p><p>"Good, see you then. Love you" she whispered that last part.</p><p>"Love you too" I answered.</p><p>The call ended, she had hung up.</p><p>My heart did skip a beat that time for sure hearing "Love you"</p><p>I really really wanted to see Fang....</p><p>What the fuck is in this medicine?</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As we stepped out from the Nascar into the driveway of our home, Naser wished us luck. </p><p>"You'll need it" is all he said. </p><p>Before Reed or I could say anything back he sped off in his usual manner. </p><p>Though I will admit it was a bit faster than normal. </p><p>"I think his phone was still buzzing," I mentioned to Reed. </p><p>In fact it had not once stopped during our ride here. Though he did send a few texts.</p><p>"Guess his girlfriend really wanted to talk to him about tonight".</p><p>I think Reed was trying to ease the tension in the air, but for the life of me Naser sure looked ..Focused.</p><p>I should be concerned by that.</p><p>I mean even for a med student those eyes were laser focused. </p><p>He's been with this girl for a while, for sure even during Estrus Season.</p><p>...I still couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.</p><p>Trish and Fang were "getting ready" together. I think the plan was for Reed to head out with Trish back to their place. Our home had been closer so it just made things easier to do it here, Fang had said.</p><p>Turning back to our house everything looked calm enough.</p><p>No lights on but other than that... </p><p>"Huh, don't know what I was expecting" Reed chimed. </p><p>I didn't either, it was just another night I suppose when you really get down to it. </p><p>"Fang sounded fine on the phone, maybe we are just getting taken for a ride?" </p><p>Reed looked at me, rolled his eyes and shrugged. </p><p>Guess it was my turn for a joke to fall flat. </p><p>Still, I did notice a small smirk. Bros to the end.</p><p>Thinking back to the last few hours.</p><p>The way that Samantha acted on our way out of the home.</p><p>That and Ridley's face once she told us to "get out".</p><p>There was the issue of all the running that I heard too...</p><p>All this build up for something that happens yearly.</p><p>I'm worrying too much, Fang sounded perfectly in control on the phone.</p><p>Definitely not like some hormone crazed dino goth wife.</p><p>I was kind of disappointed in a way.</p><p>I was also worrying too much...</p><p>Go home Anon, go home to your perfect wife and enjoy the holiday.</p><p>With that we walked up the steps and I unlocked the door. </p><p>It was dark inside, what with there being no lights on. </p><p>Also really quiet, like dead silent. </p><p>"What, you don't have lights in your house bro? Should look into them, pretty cool" </p><p>"Of course we do, you've been over lots of times" I reply trying to flip a light switch. </p><p>What is the bulb gone or something? </p><p>I look inside... it actually was gone. </p><p>Alarms start to go off in my head, did someone break in? </p><p>Is Fang Ok? Is Trish?</p><p>I see Reed get a worried look too.</p><p>We hurry into the living room. </p><p>Reed Calles out for Trish, I Fang.</p><p>There was no reply. </p><p>I think it's fair to say I was starting to panic a little. </p><p>I had just talked to Fang what, 10 minutes ago on the phone? </p><p>My mind was racing. What could have happened?</p><p>That's when I noticed it. </p><p>The change was subtle I'll admit, a shift in movement. The soft sound of breathing. </p><p>Right on the edge of hearing, in that zone where you're not sure if it was real or not. </p><p>As if on command with that thought, a lamp flicked to life. </p><p>Revealing 2 figures standing behind us. </p><p>We turned, and I swear Reed's jaw dropped wider than I've ever seen. </p><p>I should know, mine did too. </p><p>Standing in the light was Fang and Trish. </p><p>Thank Raptor Jesus, they were healthy and not ax murdered as feared.</p><p>What was not expected was the lingerie they had chosen to wear for the occasion. </p><p>Frilly underwear from an expensive brand. </p><p>Familiar actually, like I've seen them wear it before somewhere. </p><p>Which is impossible since I've never seen them together in their underwear of course</p><p>I also noticed that I could see my wifes markings.</p><p>The kind that I needed a black light to see.</p><p>I should be curious about that, but right now I didn't seem to mind.</p><p>"Fan-" I start to stammer before being cut off by sudden movement. </p><p>Trish had lunged toward Reed, tackling him to the ground as he yelped. </p><p>It was fast, precise, terrifying. </p><p>He was pinned flat on his back and she was on top. </p><p>Trish had a wicked smile on her face.</p><p>Red along her face and neckline.</p><p>Her breathing heavy.</p><p>Pure lust in her eyes.</p><p>All targeted towards Reed.</p><p>She gave him a quick kiss on the lips.</p><p>I think she might have snuck a bite in there as well.</p><p>That looked like it hurt.</p><p>Before Reed could even speak, before he could do anything, she grabbed his tail and dragged him toward the guest bedroom. </p><p>Knocking over a corner table with his flailing body. </p><p>She quickly turned the corner and went inside, Reed managed to grab onto the door frame and looked at me. </p><p>I could only see his head and arms holding him in place. In his eyes I saw a myriad of emotions. </p><p>Fear, Surprise, confusion and....bliss? </p><p>I swear he gave me a shit eating grin before He was pulled in and the door slammed shut. </p><p>The entire assault could have only been a few seconds. </p><p>"How did-" </p><p>Before I could finish I felt 2 taloned hands grab me by the shoulders. </p><p>I spun to see Fang within inches of my face. </p><p>Her lovely Snoot right by my lips. I could feel her breathing.</p><p>Those Eyes locked into mine. Beautiful amber eyes, starlight in living form.</p><p>Like Trish, she moved quickly; Unlike Trish it was silent and graceful. I should have been shocked, maybe a little scared.</p><p>Right now however, the feeling was something else.</p><p>Still I should have seen her coming. </p><p>Maybe the medicine had something to do with it, maybe not.</p><p>Then it clicked, the pieces falling into place.</p><p>Trish moved first to throw my attention from Fang. </p><p>With my gaze shifted Fang simply moved into striking range. </p><p>Clever girl, I never even stood a chance. </p><p>"Got you" she whispered. Low and full of seduction.</p><p>"Yea, you do" was all I managed out.</p><p>She did after all.</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>To say that Fang had me dead to rights was pretty accurate.</p><p>Her hands were tight, but then slackened. </p><p>I took the chance to wrap my own around her waist, brought her in close, and did the only thing that was on my mind.</p><p>I kissed her.</p><p>Sweet Raptor Jesus I kissed her.</p><p>Her body was hot, radiating heat.</p><p>I could feel myself getting pretty warm too.</p><p>When we finally parted, leaving a trail of saliva between, Fang grabbed my hand and interlocked fingers with mine.</p><p>I should mention that her face had that same reddish pink hue her mom had. It went down her neckline and on her chest. Her breasts were also red, and a bit fuller may I add.</p><p>She turned toward the stairs, to our bedroom and with our hands still locked together made a run for it.</p><p>I ran with her with all my heart. </p><p>We made it up the stairs and through the door leading into our room.</p><p>We crashed on the bed kissing and flailing.</p><p>Even a giggle or two was heard.</p><p>My shirt came off before I fully landed, shoes and socks flying in opposite directions not long after. Also my pants were gone at some point, though I don’t remember when.</p><p>This medicine was doing something to me and I think I figured it out.</p><p>I don’t think I would survive the night without it. It was probably doing something to my body to make me more...viable for the holiday.</p><p>The only thing I had left was my boxers.</p><p>I went to take off Fangs...outfit.</p><p>I expected the top to have some sort of hook or clip but it just popped off, ease of access.</p><p>I liked that.</p><p>She removed the rest with a swift motion and mounted me.</p><p>Her full glory was visible, time slowed down a bit and I took in the view.</p><p>I see now why no one wanted to talk about tonight, you really did just have to experience it.</p><p>A thought than popped into my mind, I reached down into my jacket on the floor and pulled out the box of condoms</p><p>“Fang wait” I said, holding up the box.</p><p>She gave a deep loving smile.</p><p>“You remembered, good boy,” she purred.</p><p>Then she slapped the box right out of my hand.</p><p>“But no” The package went flying into the wall.</p><p>It exploded, it’s guts flying out.</p><p>It slumped to the floor, dead.</p><p>“Oh” I looked into those Amber eyes again.</p><p>I see, she never really wanted them. Just another thing to make sure I didn't run. I don’t think there was enough in the box for tonight anyways.</p><p>Who would ever run from this?</p><p>“You’d be surprised” She leaned in and grabbed my face. Bringing hers in closer.</p><p>“The stories mom told me about what it took to catch dad” She kissed me before I could ask for specifics.</p><p>I didn't have the breath to talk after that regardless.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>More to come...</p></div>
