<h1>An Evening With Tracy</h1><div><p>Title: An Evening With Tracy</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Tracy</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot </p><p>Author: Skogsraon</p><p>Summary: Relationships push and pull, they mend and tear. How much of ourselves do we compromise to make them work, and how do we recover from exerting ourselves when we try too hard? Anon runs into an acquaintance, that he asks for advice.</p><p>â€‹</p><p>It's a nice day outside, the sun is shining brightly, it's not too humid, there's not a cloud in sight and a soft summer breeze is blowing through the park. Here I was, sitting alone. It was absolutely insufferable doing something this healthy.</p><p>I could be fishing for (you)s at home, grab a few screenshots of Derrit that I post and just wait for the seething replies, or simply sit at home playing Rock Ring while sipping on a cold drink with my desktop fan keeping me comfortably cool. Today was supposed to be our day together, I had even taken a shower and put the good 5$ perfume on. Yet here I was, sweating away my investment all by myself.</p><p>Other happy couples were walking by, the bastards, enjoying their time together; they oughta know better. Absolutely disgusting. Revolting. Sickening to my core, gutwrenching.</p><p>Speaking of gutwrenching, I hadn't had a bite to eat since breakfast, so I might as well mald while I'm munching on something unhealthy. Now, to initiate the sensors, fire up the scanners. There must be something around to grab, the closest cheap restaurant was about twice as far away as I'd want to walk for an unhealthy meal in this heat, especially without breaking bank. Luckily, there seems to be a small hotdog stand not foo far away, just across the park and close to a couple of benches standing in the cool and comfortable shade of the nearby trees. There were a few meteordodgers in line, but a good greasy heartstopper would make it worth the wait. The grumbling of my stomach interrupting my thoughts settled it; time for a trek.</p><p>Moving about again was nice, just sitting in the sun was grating, but now that I'm not stuck on a leeward bench the wind is actually cooling me down again. The rustling of the leaves in the wind, the soft padding of the grass and the distant sound of families enjoying their weekend in the sun was almost enjoyable. I sure wish Fang could be here too, and not stuck in bandpractice. Either way, the smell of hotdogs is coming closer; embracing me. The queue wasn't actually that long anymore, it got through fast with the lightning pace that the orange dino was slinging hotdogs.</p><p>Huh, it's Tracy again. She seems to show up whenever I'm hungry these days, was she following me around? Like a guardian angel, absolving my hungry soul? Good to see her again though, I haven't been able to thank her fully for last time; Raptor Jesus knows that her advice got me out of a tight spot. The hulking rubeosaurus in front of me had finally got their lunch handed to them, so I moved forward and she looked up.</p><p>"Hey! So what can I get ya?"</p><p>"'Sup, Tracy! How's your day in the sun going?"</p><p>"Mighty fiiine, business is booming! So how ya doin'?", she grins at me before interrupting my reply, "How'd it go with that girl of yours? You looked mighty worried last time I gotcha' talkin'?"</p><p>How did she remember, she must have had hundreds of people pass by since then? But, last time... Her advice had actually helped to clear my mind and to get me some perspective. Fuck it, might as well humor her.</p><p>"It went well! Good, even, thanks to you."</p><p>"Ain't that a beaut! So what do you need this ol' lady to fix for you today?"</p><p>"I NEED something greasy and a cool drink."</p><p>"Comin' riiight up! Heart's workin' fine for now, then?", there's a glint of care in her smug grin, just enough to ascertain that it wasn't wholly a joke.</p><p>Maybe it was worth it? Free complimentary relationship-therapy with a hotdog and soda was good value, and my wallet sure couldn't take much more pressure.</p><p>"Would be working a whole lot better with some food in me, but other than that Fang's been really busy lately."</p><p>Tracy starts preparing a godly feast, as she responds and pulls out an ice-cold can from a small cooler.</p><p>"Fang's your girl, then?", reaching me the soda as she starts adding toppings to the mysterymeat surprise. I crack it open, sipping on it as I think about how to respond.</p><p>"Yeah. Same one I talked about last time. Oh, and for topping..."</p><p>"I remember, I remember. Here ya go!", handing over two exquisite and delicious specimen; just the way I wanted them. She had to be my guardian angel.</p><p>"We were supposed to hang out today, I'd just come to her band's jam session."</p><p>"Yea?"</p><p>"Then her bitch of a friend, Trish, insisted on it being a boyfriend-free sesh. A decision she took at the moment me and Fang walked into the studio."</p><p>"Sounds rough, kid! So why's you here all by your lonesome?"</p><p>I grab a bite, down it with some soda. I... Might not be the man with the most finesse, but amongst the skills I had perfected were shitposting and aggravating people. It was a art.</p><p>"I told her that it wasn't fair, that it'd be a handicap for Fang and Reed both, while she would never have to worry about it affecting her. It took a few seconds, then she practically exploded."</p><p>Tracy busts out laughing, not unexpected, but surprising enough to see her be a bit more open. Quite nice, actually.</p><p>"Then... Fang basically had to drag her off me. She told me that they really needed the practice, and if they were to get anything done Trish would need to be cool."</p><p>Wiping a tear from her eye, Tracy steadies herself against the cart. Still chuckling to herself.</p><p>"Served that broad right, I reckon."</p><p>"Sure did", the look on Trish's face was priceless. I would file it in my mental vault of trophies, to enjoy on rainy days. "Then Fang kissed me, and sent me on my way. We were supposed to hang out at... Well, half an hour ago, but I can't even reach her cell right now, Trish must have put it on silent."</p><p>"That explains why you's all out on your lonesome."</p><p>"Mhmm."</p><p>"So you two's plannin' on havin' a date today? Great pick of day, then!"</p><p>A date? Me and Fang? Oh, I hadn't really thought of it like that, it always felt like we just hung out. It had been a while since last time we did something proper and date-like, especially since I always felt the hairs on my neck stand up thinking of Ripley tearing me in half should I even THINK of his daughter in a romantic way. Even more so, if I'd go on a proper romantic date with her.</p><p>"We hadn't really set it up like that... I haven't even gone on any real dates. With women.", then a bead of cold sweat runs down my forehead. What had I just admitted to?</p><p>Oh shit. OH SHIT. Oh. Shit. Secret identity of being a kissless virgin exposed, and potentially accidentally outing myself as a homosexual. Well, no longer kissless at least, but FUCK.</p><p>Tracy was leaning over on her cart, smiling seductively with a slightly raised eyebrow.</p><p>"So, Anon, how's a handsome young man like you's never got with a girl before?"</p><p>I must have turned at least fifty shades of red. All the blood in my body was redirected through the fastlane. Higher brain functions: inaccessible.</p><p>Tracy heightens and lowers her eyebrows incitingly, with a smug grin. She knew she had hit a gold vein, and she took her time rubbing it in. She's actually pretty damn cute, even if she's got an intimidating aura for a woman of such short stature. Thinking in such tracks got me blushing even more, what was I doing? Quick! A retort!</p><p>"It's just never been the right woman, before now.", nice save. Time for the finisher, "So, would a pretty woman like you want spend the evening together and teach me all she knows over dinner and wine? I'd be the luckiest man alive."</p><p>That was NOT my intended path of retaliation, but holy shit did it put her on her back foot; it washed away her cocksure grin, replacing it with a sweet smile and a soft blush. Her eyes were filled with glee, as she straightened her back, and looked into mine.</p><p>"I never thought you'd ask. Of course I do! But... Just as a mentor, y'know?", winking at me as she says the last part. I couldn't believe what just happened, my heart was beating fast and I found myself smiling back, like a lovesick fool, towards her. Did I just get myself a date? With a woman I was somehow somewhat interested in? My train of thought, and intimate eyecontact with Tracy, was interrupted when she nodded her head back towards the park.</p><p>"Yer girl's come back, I see! Now, you treat her right. I'll be catching you later. Don't forget the napkin, alright?", and goddamn was she cute when she wanted to. I reached out for the outstretched napkin, and was about to put it in my pocket when I noticed some inkstains... There was a number scribbled on it. Oh. OH. I had just gotten a girl's number. I HAD JUST GOTTEN A GIRL'S NUMBER, AND SHE WAS ADORABLE.</p><p>Turning back to Tracy, we seemed to both be a bit overtaken by the sudden shift of tone, I'm leaning on her stand, having gotten close without really noticing it. Tracy gently reaches out, putting her tender hand on mine, as she gives me doe eyes. My heart might melt. She's stroking the back of it, I can feel her soft, cool skin touch mine with affection.</p><p>"Hey, Anon?"</p><p>"Y-yeah?"</p><p>A pause, she smiles towards me.</p><p>"ya still owe me five bucks for the 'dogs an' soda."</p><p>I quickly pay off my debt, while Tracy laughs at my burning cheeks, before I nod goodbye as she waves me off; heading for Fang. Maybe, just maybe, being out meeting people wasn't as insufferable as I'd initially thought it to be. Chance encounters had been good to me, very good to me even, so far. Tracy was a good woman, I somehow knew she'd have my back whenever I needed it.</p><p>Walking back through the park, me and Fang met midway. We moved in for a hug, she was a bit warm and sweaty after sitting in a hot studio for half a day and then being out in the blazing sun when walking over to the park; yet it was still nice to hold her tight and to feel her hug me back. A quick kiss, then we unstuck ourselves from eachother.</p><p>"Missed you."</p><p>"Missed you too. Trish was a total bitch today, thanks for being so cool when dealing with it."</p><p>"Hey, I know how important the band is to you; and even if Trish is brusque to me, she doesn't seem to bad when she's just hanging out with you and Reed."</p><p>"Yeah, she's got her good sides too, y'know. But, I want to spend this afternoon with you, I have already had to deal with her for faaaar too long.", her tone indicating a bit of bitterness, but mostly just happiness from getting to spend some time just the two of us.</p><p>Then we walk off, as Fang talks about how the practice went, venting about the things that went sour and perking up when she gets to how much progress they've made in preparing for their next gig. Apparently, even Reed was sober and working hard today, under the pressure of getting it done in time. We get some icecream, replacing our energy levels as walk off back into the city. Fang asks me how my day has been, so I tell her about chilling in the park just taking in the atmosphere and enjoying summer. Which of course prompts a 'dweeb', before I can continue on with talking about how I met Tracy again.</p><p>"That Tracy, the hotdog vendor? So?"</p><p>"She gave me some good relationship advice last time we met, I just wanted to say thanks. Talked about how you and I were doing now.", suddenly causing Fang to stop and look at me with a hint of skepticism.</p><p>"So? How ARE we doing right now?", once again I put myself inbetween a rock and a hard place. Time to improvise.</p><p>"Fang, we are fantastic. It's only, this is my first real relationship, and I want to do it right, y'know?"</p><p>"I think you're doing great, Anon. I'm happy with you.", she reaches out a hand, taking mine and squeezing it as we keep walking down the street hand-in-hand.</p><p>"It feels good to be with you. But I do owe a lot of it to Tracy, too.", and I sure did. Calling her my guardian angel might not be enough.</p><p>"So Anon, let's make this afternoon count. What are you doing this evening, do you want to hang out at my place? Mom has promised to have dad on a leash the next time you come around."</p><p>"Kinky, but a bit too much information.", causing Fang to laugh and we stop as she rests her head on my shoulder. We stand there, watching the slowly approaching sunset color the sky and surrounding buildings in a warm palette of soft pink and orange tones.</p><p>We stop, letting the distant sounds of traffic be the only backdrop as we spend a quiet moment together.</p><p>"I've actually asked to see Tracy, when she's not busy with her hotdog stand, to help me out with some relationship advice.", Fang kisses my cheek, letting her wing wrap around me.</p><p>"Just be careful to not turn our relationship into me being in love with her, instead. It's Anon that I want, not her."</p><p>"But aren't we simply the sum of the world around us? Anon is just a reflection, of the reality we live in. I don't exist, I'm si-"</p><p>"Dweeb.", then she lightly elbows me in the side.</p><p>"I promise to not turn into her, alright?"</p><p>"Good."</p><p>There's a nice route through the inner city, we pass by some shops as we go thrifting through second-hand stores trying out outlandish outfits, even seeing Fang in some more feminine clothing through the promise of committing sudoku if I EVER tell anyone about it, and a few music stores where Fang jams on the expensive guitars. Oddly enough, or not if considering Wurm Drama's track record, it sounds great; Fang's has genuine talent when not constrained by Trish. Eventually, we walk the final stretch back to Fang's street, but we share a hug and a small kiss before we part. I knew Ripley had a hunting rifle, and good aim, so no need to get closer than necessary. We say our goodbyes, and I walk off to the bus heading for Skin Row.</p><p>A quick shower and shave later, I put on a fresh set of fancy clothes and some more of that expensive perfume. Why was I so nervous? It was just a dinner between friends, right? Tracy had been great support for my entire time here, we'd simply have a meal together so that I could thank her properly, for everything. Looking in the mirror, I hardly recognize myself. The handsome man in the mirror looked back confidently, was this who she had seen peaking through when we had met earlier? Damn, she was a professional lifecoach. I take a deep breath, and steady myself. My phone has been lying on by bedside table to charge since I got home, with the napkin nested safely underneath it. This is it, don't get scared now. The new Anon had some backbone, so I'd be damned if I wouldn't use it. Picking up the phone, I give her a call. What would I say? Eh, it'd work itself out. It dialed once, twice, thrice, four times. Then someone picked up.</p><p>"Heya, it's Tracy! Who am I speakin' to?", the background noise of a crowd almost drowning out her words.</p><p>"Evenin', Tracy! So how are you doing?"</p><p>"Stand's been holdin' up well enough, lotsa people out and about today!", she seemed focused on something, properly busy with the stand.</p><p>"Looking forward to our date tonight, when do you get off?"</p><p>"Plannin' on shutting it down by half-past seven, should be ready for dinner an hour later, if that's good wichu?"</p><p>"Sounds lovely! Anywhere you want to go?"</p><p>"There's this new french joint, good atmosphere, jazz, not tooooo noisy and with some proper privacy. Ya dig?"</p><p>"Perfect, French sounds good. I'll be waiting. Wait, what's the name?"</p><p>"Eeeeeh, eeeeeh... I'll lookit up, be sendin' you a text as soon as I'm able! Line's getting long!"</p><p>"See you then."</p><p>"Be seein' ya, cutie!", then she turns off the call. Did she just call me 'cutie'?</p><p>Passing the time watching something, or browsing the Lebanese cooking forums didn't quite ease my mind as much as I hoped it would, so I settled for playing something instead; booting up Rock Ring on Legendary with all skulls. The game was kicking my ass all the way into next month, but the surge of adrenaline when I gained an inch right before losing a mile made time pass by quickly enough that I'd almost made it one checkpoint in before my alarm rang. Tracy had texted me the destination earlier, so I'd looked up the bus timetables and made sure that I had a good amount of margin even if I should miss the first bus and have to take the next; a precaution well needed since sometimes whole buses would go missing when they got too close to Skin Row. It was rare enough for two to go missing right after each other, so I knew I'd get there in time. Turning off the gaming system, taking a swig from my water bottle, brushing my teeth and grabbing a jacket that was ugly enough to not look like someone that would have anything expensive on them; I head off into the late evening towards the nearest bus stop. My heart was racing, I'd be going on a fancy dinner date with a pretty woman for the first time in my life.</p><p>A walk of not-getting-mugged and an uneventful busride later, I arrived close enough to the restaurant that I'd walk the rest of the way through the warm summer evening comfortably; I took off my scuffed jacket, hanging it over my arm to hide the worst parts of it, before heading off towards the restaurant. The buzz of the city's nightlife set the mood well, people chatting outside sitting by tables with drinks and food, with tunes pouring out through the open doors of the restaurants and hotels I passed on my way there. Getting there, it looked very comfy. A hole in the wall, no big advertisement or flashy neon light; looking through the windows there seemed to be mostly middle-aged or older people enjoying their meals, with a small stage in the back where a small jazzband was performing. This was the type of restaurant that had insanely good food for basically no cost at all, a real diamond hiding among shiny glass baubles. I relax, there's a fair while left, so might as well grab a seat outside by an empty table while I wait for her. The waiter comes by, I tell him I'd need a table for two, preferably with a bit of privacy, but that I was waiting for my lady to arrive. He nods, heading off and soon enough coming back with a small bottle of water and two glasses. Time passes by, the band is actually quite good even if it's nowhere close to what I usually listen to; jazz might just have to be added to the list of tunes I listen to. Then I see her, walking towards the restaurant, waving and smiling.</p><p>Dressed in a beautiful sleeveless red dress, perfectly accenting her figure, with a thin jacket draped over her shoulders, wearing jet black pumps that gave her just the bit of height she'd need so that we could keep eyecontact without her having to tilt her neck all too much. She's put on makeup too, a natural look, but with her beautiful face there isn't anything left to improve. Wait... What exactly was I thinking about?</p><p>"Anoooon! Good t'see ya!", she takes the last few steps up to me, reaching out her arms for a hug, as I stand up and take her in my arms. She's got a nice perfume on, a faint flowery base with a gentle spice overtone. If I could choose, I wouldn't end this embrace, but we separate soon enough.</p><p>"Tracy, same to you! You look... Gorgeous.", garnering a smile.</p><p>"You're not to bad y'self, handsome."</p><p>"Picked out a great place, how'd you even find this?"</p><p>"Chef's intuition! An' somethin' called a newspaper review."</p><p>"Shall we?"</p><p>We enter together, the waiter that greeted me earlier takes our jackets and leads us to our table; offset enough in a semi-walled booth with a good view over the stage. The music isn't too invasive, once we get in the booth it's just loud enough to talk comfortably over it. Tracy's face is lit up with joy, a childish happiness overtaking her when she sits down and we're handed our menus. The front is in French, but hopefully I remembered enough to wing it through an order. Just now, I realised everyone around us was chatting in French, this truly was a locals' place, and the food smelled heavenly.</p><p>"So how'd today go for you two's?", pitching me a softball with a smug smile.</p><p>"We had a nice walk'n'talk, enjoying town."</p><p>"Aaah, to be young and in love again. You were real cute together, y'know?"</p><p>Were we? Me and Fang had stuck together for a while now... But noone had really commented on us as a couple, except for... Yeah. Some affirmation that we were doing something right felt good.</p><p>"Ehehe...", looking down at the table to not accidentally get embarassed again, "We've been going steady for a while now. Some obstacles, but we've managed."</p><p>"Oh? Wouldn't be able to tell with ya two lovebirds."</p><p>"There's been a few setbacks..."</p><p>"Like what, handsome?", the compliment is heartwarming but the question is dreadful. I carefully consider where to even begin.</p><p>"Tracy... Is everything we say here just between the two of us?"</p><p>"Of course it is, unless you want somethin' else."</p><p>I sigh deep, raking my mind for a thread to start unravelling the whole mess from, breaking eyecontact as I look down into the table.</p><p>"Lucy's a troubled girl, with a whole trunk of issues that I frankly don't know if I'm mature enough to deal with. Like she's a ticking bomb, that might at any time explode and just go out guns blazing."</p><p>Tracy nods along, letting me continue with interrupting or asking for specifics. I'm not sure if I could make it through if I'd have to answer detailed questions; without breaking down.</p><p>"There's this whole thing... About Trish gaslighting her, and I don't really understand why. She's come out as nonbinary, become more hostile, gone into hardcore ironic postpunk whatevercore and shut herself off from her friends and family.", I take a deep breath, trying to find a way to continue. "And it's wearing her thin. She's selfharming, cutting class, I have no idea where or when she will stop, or even if she will. What's her and what is coping."</p><p>She can probably see that I'm struggling, so she reaches out her hands and grasps mine; smiling assuringly. They're still silky smooth, she's even put on black nailpolish. She's reminding me that she's right here; it somehow coaxes a bit of light back into me, so I smile back, meeting her eyes again.</p><p>"I don't know if I'm enough, and I'm scared about what will happen if I fail. What should I do, Tracy. Where do I even begin?", she nods, looking away with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>"I think ya worry too much."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"ya worry too much. And you might need to check on your hearin'.", clutching my hands tight, then releasing them and leaning back. "This girl of yours? You can't be the one fixin' her up, she has to fix 'erself. All you can do is just be there as much as you can."</p><p>She does have a point. Lucy was deep in the shit, but I'm not the man to pull her out of it; I'm in no way experienced enough for that. Maybe, it was fine to just tag along for as long as I could. But then... It hurts to even consider it.</p><p>"Then I'd have to, you know, if I can't do it."</p><p>"Mhmm. That's the way life swings, kid. ya gotta' roll with the punches.", she looks at me, solemnly, "Sometimes, it's better to let things go before they break. Just when ya see that ya can't really fix the cracks."</p><p>It hurts. I know it to be true, but it still hurts.</p><p>"Hey, cheer up. It ain't the end of the world, the sun keeps risin', the sea keeps rushin' to shore."</p><p>"But what if she's the one?"</p><p>"Hell, kid, ya better know you'll meet 'the one' multiple times if y'keep lookin', that's how life goes."</p><p>Why did she seem a bit sad when she said it? Did something go south for her, once?</p><p>"So how have you been doing, in life, then?"</p><p>She sighs.</p><p>"This was s'posed to be about you, y'know? But since you asked, I've done it twice by this point. ya get tired eventually of runnin' after it, so now I'm waitin'."</p><p>"Sorry, I shouldn't have asked."</p><p>"No worries. But kid?", and she brightens up, "I have great memories from two great relationships, you still get to keep the best parts; I ain't unhappy because it ended, I'm happy I had it."</p><p>"That's... A surprisingly good way to look at it."</p><p>"See? This lady knows a thing or two.", then she winks at me, "Now how about we get some food, I'm starvin'!"</p><p>I try to bullshit my french, but Tracy catches me and takes over ordering when consider asking for le hamburgere, saying it would be a waste of good cuisine. A pinot noir to share, and some sort of miniature smorgasbord with melted cheese. Raclette, I think? We smalltalk for a while; the waiter shows up with our wine, pouring us a glass each and leaving us the bottle. It's nice spending time with her just talking about life and our experiences, now that the wine has loosened our lips a bit, and soon enough the waiter returns with a HUGE selection of charcuterie, a bowl of potatoes, fresh bread, cornichons, a platter of fruits, veggies, and mushrooms, a small bowl of walnuts and another with roasted garlic. To top it all off, we were left a big block of melted cheese, and told to enjoy our meal. This looked unhealthy, in the best possible way.</p><p>Tracy began describing the nuances of the food, as we started to serve ourselves, and she was damn good at it. She knew a little bit about everything, from combining flavors in a bite to how the French put a high emphasis on good ingredient like the Americans would never aspire to. It was soothing, hearing her talk about something she was so incredibly passionate about. She truly was beautiful, there was so much luster in her that was peeking out through the cracks once she got going. This was an entirely different woman from the snarky and reserved lady standing out on the streets selling junkfood.</p><p>"Hey, you've been starin' at me for a while, did I catch your eye?", I must have been daydreaming, this was a great time after all, I'm glad I had the courage to meet up.</p><p>"Y-yeah, it's just, it's lovely to see you so passionate, you know?"</p><p>"Hehh, what can I tell ya? Haven't been able to relax and unwind like this with good company for a while!", stretching back, I can see her chest move in the tight dress. Looking away, I try to respond without sounding as flustered as I actually am.</p><p>"M- M- Mhmm."</p><p>"What were you lookin' at, handsome? Don't ya know it's rude to ogle a lady without her permission?", the smirk is almost reaching ear to ear, and I can feel the lord calling for me. Clenching my jaw, I try to focus on something else to brake my racing mind.</p><p>"I just..."</p><p>She breaks out in laughter, the sadistic dino in front of me is going to lead me to an early grave with a heart attack. Not a bad way to go, though.</p><p>"Dont'cha worry, I do like showin' off a bit. Ain't too bad a way to grab your attention."</p><p>"Y-you too.", her laughter starts ebbing out, but there's still a light chuckle over my flustered response.</p><p>"Tell ya what, I'll give you a little breathin' room if you tell me about yerself? So far, you've been pretty much talkin' only about your time here, and that girl of yours?"</p><p>"I... Don't have much to talk about there.", it's true, but that's only because there's nothing left for me in that past, it was finally done with, "I had things I'd rather leave behind; currently I'm just glad to have got a fresh start here."</p><p>"Don't wanna spoil the moment with your past sins, I get it. I'm havin' a good time here too.", she taps the table, seemingly thinking about something, "I'm glad you asked me out. I'd sorta given up hope on gettin' out there again, felt like I'd just be coachin' from the sidelines for the rest of my life, y'know?"</p><p>"I understand THAT feeling."</p><p>"Havin' someone that seems to like me, even if just for one night, is more than I could have ever asked for when ya came bumblin' over to my stand t'day.", now she's the one blushing. Smiling ear to ear, it almost looks like she might fell a tear or two. This time, it's me reaching out my hand to hold hers. She doesn't resist, just holds mine as I stroke hers.</p><p>"You deserve it, more than you know.", there's a slight snifle, as a tear falls, but she keeps smiling at me.</p><p>"Thanks, I needed to hear that."</p><p>We eventually finish up our Raclette, thanks to Tracy for eventually teaching me the pronunciation, while we chatter about life. When we're done with dinner, the waiter comes by asking how the lovely couple are enjoying their food, and if they would like to order any dessert. Both me an Tracy blush, but before I get a chance to respond, she gleefully says that we are having a great time and orders two black coffÃ©es and a Clafoutis aux Cerices to share; I guess that's what I'm having for dessert. He writes down our order, then heads off with our now empty plates. I raise an eyebrow at Tracy when the waiter leaves, to which she just smirks back.</p><p>"So, are we a lovely couple now, Tracy?"</p><p>"Didn't want to correct the poor man, now did ya? I saw the smiiiile you got when he said so!", and now I am about as red as the few drops still lingering in my wine glass. She sees the opening, and pushes on:</p><p>"Be honest, kid, it's been nice playin' at bein' a couple for an evenin'."</p><p>There was a point to that, I'd really enjoyed spending this time with her. But I'll be damned if I give her any more ground on which to tease me, or I might never recover.</p><p>"S-so, what's a claw footy awes arise?", trying to push out anything resembling regular speech was rough when she had me under her heel like this.</p><p>Brilliant fucking recovery.</p><p>"A whatchamacallit'?", turning her smugness into genuine confusion.</p><p>"The desert you ordered us?"</p><p>A few seconds pass as she processes it, before she starts laughing, almost keeling over.</p><p>"It's a- it's a- it's...", her laughs interrupting her, "It's a type o' cherry piiiie, not a 'clawfooted awsreis'!"</p><p>I could feel the other guests amusingly eyeing us over. Maybe I wasn't as good at being smooth as I'd imagined.</p><p>"I- I know what it is, it's just that I haven't heard the name of it in french before."</p><p>She sits up, looking deep into my eyes.</p><p>"Anon?"</p><p>"I have a question for you... If you would?", a small smile taking over. My heart won't make it through this entire evening if she kept being this cute.</p><p>"Shoot?"</p><p>"What's innit' then?"</p><p>The gentle smile and longing eyes turn into a face of crushing victory, easily blitzing through my weakened defenses. Anon has fallen, the enemy had achieved a decisive victory. Wait, the enemy? No, Tracy was...</p><p>"Cherries?"</p><p>"Good so far."</p><p>"Pie?"</p><p>"You're doin' great."</p><p>"Uh, wine?"</p><p>The french loved wine, right?</p><p>"Just admit you have no idea, and I'll let ya slide this time."</p><p>I hesitate for a second, so she assuringly puts a hand on my shoulder as I sigh. Her black nailpolish fits her perfectly.</p><p>"Anon, don't feel lika ya need to be someone else when I've already told ya that I wanted to go here with you.", caressing my shoulder, "And never try to bullshit a chef about food, kid."</p><p>"Thanks, and I won't."</p><p>"Good. An' it's pronounced kee-laa-foou-tease auhe ce-reese, in case ya want to go impressin' another girl.", letting go of my shoulder and winking at me. I'd try and remember it, this time. Wait, if I'd want to impress another girl?</p><p>The waiter arriving with our delicious cherryfilled baked goods, as well as a matching set of cups and plates, luckily interrupts my previous train of thought. Was I trying to impress Tracy? As the waiter sets it all down, I find myself looking over at her. She was happy, enjoying the evening, taking in the experience with a childish glee. She said she didn't do this very often, how long had it been since last? Could I even ask such a thing, without tanking the mood? Most importantly, was to be here in the present. If I could pay her back, even a fraction, of how much she had given me I'd be more than happy.</p><p>The waiter leaves when he's set the table, so Tracy scoots closer, bringing her plate and cup of coffee with her.</p><p>"Y'see, this pie, if done correctly...", she prods at it with the serving utensil, "A-hah! It's gone and been done right! Right here?", then she points at the uncovered treasure, "It's a cherry seed! Bakin' 'em whole gives it more flavor."</p><p>It smells fantastic; the mix between the dark coffee and the sweet aroma of cherries that starts spreading as soon as Tracy begins cutting into the pie. She serves us both, before she leans back with her coffee in her hand and takes a sip, to which I follow suit. It's a lot stronger than I'm used to, but it's good to have something warm and slightly bitter after all that fatty savoury sweetness from before. Tracy looks over at me:</p><p>"So, is this what you expected? An evenin' with a lady houndin' you endlessly while still ending up just talkin' about 'erself and 'er food?"</p><p>Taking another sip, I piece together an honest response:</p><p>"I did NOT expect this, but it's been way more fun than I'd imagined."</p><p>"I feel the same way."</p><p>"Getting to know you better has been good, I like this version of Tracy a lot.", which prompts a tiny yelp and a blush from the woman basically sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with me at this point. I assume she's not used to compliments.</p><p>I have to do it, right? She's defenseless, I have the opportunity to move in for the kill; revenge for her endless assault of crude jokes and flirtatious deeds. I reach out my hand, petting her gently on her head, as I look into her eyes and smile wholeheartedly, she looks embarassed and I can almost hear how hard her heart is beating. Then I fire the howitzer:</p><p>"You're a wonderful woman, Tracy. I'm glad I met you."</p><p>The radars are indicating that the target was hit and is losing speed. We have confirmed hits, I repeat, confirmed hits; there is smoke coming from the engines, with probable multi-engine failure. Mission well done, soldier.</p><p>Like a deer in the headlights, she had completely lost her ability to act. So I just kept petting her head, savoring the moment. She was surprisingly smooth, a gentle softness but not much more grazing my fingers. A faint warmth from the wine and coffee was emanating throughout her, and I could feel it both in my hand caressing her head and from her body.</p><p>Her body that was just now pressing up against me.</p><p>THAT body.</p><p>"Y'know, I like you too, Anon..."</p><p>I can't believe she flipped this on me; or could it be genuine? Would I want it to be genuine? Then she continues:</p><p>"I sure hope we can do this again sometime, it's nice bein' out an' about."</p><p>"Yeah, it's not too bad to spend an evening like this."</p><p>"Y'should come over more often, grab a lunch or two, don't be a stranger."</p><p>"I promise that I'll try."</p><p>"Good. Now, it'd be a crime to let that pie go cold."</p><p>She moves just an inch away from me as I withdraw my hand, and we get back at it; going at the pastry while talking about life. I'm trying to not be as superficial anymore, going into the things I tried to dodge earlier; but surprisingly, (or just like I knew she would,) there isn't any backlash or rude comments coming from her side. She just accepts it, gives a few insightful words, then we get on with our evening. We spend a bit more time talking about her past too, now that she's warmed up a bit, and I'm glad to see this more vulnerable side of her.</p><p>We just sit relaxing for a bit longer after we've downed the dessert as people start to depart from the restaurant, the band having quit their performance a while ago without us really noticing. We talk, enjoying the remainder of the day, until the waiter comes back to tell us that they're closing soon. So we get up, head for the exit and get handed our coats as the waiter thanks us for our visit. Coming outside from the warm restaurant, the contrast of the cool night air is comfortable; the street having quieted down, with only a light melody coming from a faraway hotel.</p><p>"It's been good, thanks for the evenin', Anon."</p><p>"Thanks for the talk, I had a good time."</p><p>"It sure felt like the hours just flew past, right?"</p><p>"Heh, they sure did."</p><p>A moment of silence, we don't seem to be heading in the same direction, so we just stand around for a few seconds before Tracy perks up with a question:</p><p>"Could I ask you for something?"</p><p>"Sure, if I can give do it I'll try."</p><p>"Could we... Share a slowdance? I've missed it for so very long. I know it might be a bit much, but..."</p><p>"But?"</p><p>"I feel I can trust ya. One final favor, no teasing.", her assuring eyes telling me that this isn't just another jest.</p><p>I nod, and we move closer, both tense with anticipation and cheeks slightly rosy from the wine and caffeine. I feel her body push up against mine. She still smells sweetly from her perfume, and her eyes are sparkling as I look down into them. When we slowly start to dance along to the faraway melody drifting out over the street, we let go of our troubles. We find the timing to pace our steps along with each other, feeling the rhythm move through us both. Time seems to stretch on forever, as we hold on tight, enjoying the moment of peace and tranquility. Suck it, Fred Astaire.</p><p>Eventually the song comes to an end, but we hug for a while longer; looking up at the starlit sky above.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"One last piece of advice; you oughta' make sure to know how to end a date properly, with style, to make it worth rememberin'."</p><p>"So what's your tip?"</p><p>The query prompts a gentle smile from her, as she grabs onto my linen shirt, pulling me down into a kiss. I let her, and melt into her tender body as we once more hold each other tight. She tastes sweet, a fruity lipgloss, and her lips are exactly like I've been imagining them. Time freezes, as we embrace; two aching souls, caught on the opposite sides of the same crossroads.</p><p>"Now that's how you make it memorable.", she smiles lovingly at me, before it's once again replaced with the cocksure grin, "Don't forget it, 'cause you better not think I'll let ya practice snoggin' any more when you've got a missus waitin' for you!", and she winks.</p><p>We say a hasty goodbye, well more of a 'see you again', and part ways. She was right, this would truly be a night to remember.</p></div>
