<h1>Story Four - Principal Spears Visits The School</h1><div><p>It's been several years since I've stepped down as Volcano High's principal and let Anon take my place: I am getting pretty old after all so I needed a successor and a good one at that. I think that I've made the right choice choosing Anon: sure he may have shit taste in anime, but I'm convinced that he became better. He even became a sound engineer as far as I know, so good for him. I wonder how he's doing as the principal... Maybe I could pay a visit, just to check up on him and see how it's going.</p><p>​</p><p>«The next day...»</p><p>So here I am, at Volcano High, once again.</p><p>As I look at the school, memories start to flow, especially about this particular student that really stood out, and of course, I'm talking about Anon: he was the only human at school at the time I was the principal as he had to be transferred here from his previous school due to excessive bullying.</p><p>Hmm... It hasn't changed that much since I last worked here, it feels so nostalgic walking around here...</p><p>And while I was walking I spotted Anon, with his generic, yet indistinguishable face, together with a pterodactyl.</p><p>"Well, long time no see, Anon, Lucy!"</p><p>"Wha-? Oh! Principal Spears! I didn't expect you to come here!"</p><p>"Hi Mr. Spears, it sure is a surprise to see you here at Volcano High."</p><p>"Hello you two, it seems that both of you are doing just fine. And please, Anon, you can just call me Spears, you are the new principal after all."</p><p>"Yeah you are right: it has been an instinctive action. So, what's the occasion for your visit?"</p><p>"Well, I just wanted to see how you were doing: since I gave you the role of the principal of this school I wondered how things were going... And it seems that you are all of this just fine."</p><p>"Yes, everything is going steady. Well, almost. There are still some students that do not accept the fact that their principal is a human instead of one of their kin, sadly."</p><p>"Perhaps they are jealous that you are married to me, a dinosaur, wouldn't you think so?"</p><p>"Yeah, that's probably it. Or maybe not, hehe."</p><p>As we were chatting we heard a scream coming from the entrance of Volcano High. We rush towards the exit to see a teenage girl, standing on the edge of the rooftop, ready to jump to oblivion at any second, not even a second later and I see Anon sprinting towards the high school.</p><p>"Lucy! Make sure to keep an eye on her and the students so that all of them do not lose composure! I'm going upstairs!"</p><p>Oh no, this wasn't expected at all. Please Raptor Jesus make sure that Anon manages to handle this situation correctly. Please for the love of God...</p><p>This has been one of the few times that I felt scared, and yet both Anon and Lucy remained calm as both of them tried their best to make sure that the situation didn't escalate further.</p><p>No! This is not the time for getting lost in my thoughts: I must retain my composure like I always do and help Anon and Lucy manage the situation as best as I can, exactly like when I was the principal of this school.</p><p>Several minutes pass before I can breathe a sigh of relief seeing the girl stepping down from the edge of the roof. *Phew*</p><p>"He's pretty great, isn't he?" Lucy says.</p><p>"Yeah, I wonder how he managed to convince the girl to not jump from the roof."</p><p>We see Anon coming out from the entrance when two voices could be heard getting louder: two dinos rushing towards the girl on the verge of tears.</p><p>"Emily! Oh, thank Raptor Jesus you are fine!"</p><p>"Mom, Dad, I'm s-sorry! I was scared! I didn't know what to do! I didn't have anyone to talk to!"</p><p>What is this teen talking about I wonder? What could have pushed her so far as almost committing suicide?</p><p>"She told me that she was getting bullied by other girls because she wasn't popular enough: basically a sort of punching bag, or so to speak," said Anon with a visibly preoccupied expression. "Why didn't you tell the Principal, me, or your parents immediately? We could have helped you." Lucy explained to the teen in the verge of tears, trying to compose herself, to no avail.</p><p>"I-it's because I wasn't sure that you could have helped me! I-I'm so-sorry..."</p><p>Then Anon came closer to the girl, started caressing her head, speaking to her in a compassionate tone: "Ok, now that you told me why you were trying to jump off the roof, I can help you resolve the problem. I'll make sure that they will not bully you by taking the appropriate measures: such behavior will not be tolerated. You should really go home and rest at least for today, it must have been hard to endure all of that, but do not worry. Now you are safe with us."</p><p>She then hugged her to reassure her and sent her home.</p><p>I never expected Anon, the one that originally hated this place and was so dejected with life improved so much. And yet, he has proven me otherwise.</p><p>"Good thing that everything went fine, right dweeb?"</p><p>"*Phew* I swear I was shitting myself up there with that girl almost jumping down the edge!"</p><p>"Anon, I never expected you to become like this, you have really changed for the better, I'm so proud of you."</p><p>"Thanks, Spears! I just did what every good samaritan would have to."</p><p>"Well, I shall return home now, I just wanted to drop in to check up on you: but it seems that I do not need to worry. If you need help and advice in quality anime, you can call me anytime Anon."</p><p>"Thanks, Spears! See you soon!"</p><p>I wave my hand to the couple and I start heading home, thinking about what happened today and how Anon managed to avoid a huge tragedy.</p><p>Looking back at what happened I remembered when I gave Anon the role of principal: I thought that even if he changed he could have not handled such situations which, while they are rare, are not improbable… But he demonstrated that he could handle it just fine, better than I’ve expected to be frank.</p><p>I’m happy that I’ve made the right choice with him.</p><p>Best of luck to both of you, Anon and Lucy.</p></div>
