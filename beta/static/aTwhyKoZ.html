<h1>Reserve Tank</h1><div><p>Title: Reserve Tank</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Samantha</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: P.M.</p><p>â€‹</p><p>>Anon fucked up</p><p>>Anon can't believe just how badly he fucked up</p><p>>Not even his decision to join the navy was as poorly executed as this</p><p>>Why did he think Fang would be in the supermarket anyway? She's rehearsing with the band today</p><p>>Literally the one he encouraged her to attend so she could bring forth a new proposal to the band. One that could cement their place in the stars</p><p>>All he wanted to do was pick up something nice for her to celebrate the occasion</p><p>>That or to help console he-</p><p>>Anon pushes the idea out of his thoughts. He knows she can do it. He's seen her passion, her drive</p><p>>He's not sure what possessed him to yell Fang's name out when he saw pale ptero wings poking out from behind an aisle</p><p>>Those wings bristled slightly before before they ducked out of view, replacing themselves with the face of a completely different dinosaur</p><p>>Anon steeled himself for the encounter, pushing his weakness out</p><p>>Maybe she had forgotten him, just like Fang did at that pizza chain all that time ago</p><p>>A stranger mistaking her for someone else can't be that big a deal right?</p><p>>Standing in front of Anon is a female ptero, waiting with motherly patience by her shopping cart as he regains his composure</p><p>>Fang really is the spitting image of her mother, Samantha. If it wasn't for her long blonde hair and demeanor, Anon would mistake her for Fang</p><p>>But, there are a few things that have changed over the years. Anon doesn't remember her eyes being that tired, that dull</p><p>>The wrinkled creases crisscrossing her face offer no favours in hiding her age either</p><p>>If he hadn't jumped the gun, he would never have ended up in this situation. The only thing missing was a record scratch</p><p>>Anon finally regains control of his voice, giving a quick apology to the aged ptero for the mistake</p><p>>The terror lurking in his heart fades as he sees a smile return to Samantha's face</p><p>>She graciously accepts Anon's apology, remarking that it happens every now and then to everyone</p><p>>Crisis averted, Anon makes his way to leave, sounding out his goodbyes as he turns around</p><p>>He has to ask Fang about reconnecting with her parents</p><p>>She's been really quiet about it when he's asked before, quickly steering the conversation towards anything else</p><p>>He knows it has to happen at some point, the sooner the better. The longer it's put off, the harder it will be</p><p>>Not to mention, if he runs into Ripley of all dinos, he won't survive the encounter</p><p>>A singular step is made away from the matriarch before a sudden pressure and sharp pain by his wrist makes itself known </p><p>>The terror returns, striking its flaming lance directly into Anon's heart, as he sweeps his vision down towards the pain</p><p>>A feminine hand, with the grip of an iron manacle and claws as perilous as an executioner's axe, is attached to his arm</p><p>>The strength of it pulling on him threatens to dislocate his arm as he spins around, his footing lost as his knees meet the floor with a crash</p><p>>His lungs exhaust out a hiss of pain as adrenaline surges through his arteries, the primitive part of his brain urging him to flee</p><p>>If he could, he would</p><p>>Anon casts his eyes upward, meeting the eyes of his jailer</p><p>>What greets his vision is the face of a mother scorned, her warm smile completely absent from moments ago</p><p>>The faded dullness in her eyes has disappeared with her smile as well, her citrine orbs having found new life with her prey captured</p><p>>Razor sharp teeth glint in her mouth as she spits out her words</p><p>>"Where is my daughter?" </p><p>>Fucking hell, the god damn mumbling!</p><p>>The sheer venom in her whispered voice commands a response, but what can he even say?</p><p>>Fang hasn't revealed the circumstances of her leaving her parents. For all he knows, they're waiting to exact retribution over it</p><p>>He wasn't going to let that happen. Fang has suffered enough already, especially from his mistakes</p><p>>Besides, what can Samantha actually do in a public place?</p><p>>Anon's thoughts are quickly answered as a vicious tug shoots through his arm, his body sliding across the floor in response</p><p>>Samantha is clearly tired of his muteness, deciding for herself to drag him along as if he is nothing but a petulant child in need of discipline</p><p>>Her shopping cart shrinks into the distance. She has no need of it wherever they're going</p><p>>The polished floor offers no resistance that Anon can use to leverage himself against her</p><p>>How is she even doing this? She can't weigh more than half what Anon does</p><p>>It is in this precise moment that Anon gains a new appreciation for Ripley. What trials and tribulations had he endured to survive Samantha?</p><p>>A few of the store's customers have their phones out, taking pictures and videos of the the human getting utterly humiliated by a petite ptero</p><p>>This is going to end up on Yousnoot later, isn't it?</p><p>>Samantha turns at the aisle exit, taking Anon with her</p><p>>"Ma'am, it's against store policy to assault other customers. I'll have security escort you out if you don't stop."</p><p>>Thank you Raptor Jesus</p><p>>A weary ankylosaurus garbed in the store's uniform glares at Samantha, his stubbornness shining through the danger</p><p>>A silent battle of wills wage between the two, until Samantha finally relents, releasing Anon's arm</p><p>>Anon grasps at the whitened outline where she held him, rubbing the sore appendage furiously in an attempt to restore blood flow</p><p>>She must have decided that being barred from the store wasn't worth whatever he could tell her</p><p>>That or she knows she can just follow him as he travels home from the grocer</p><p>>...Shit</p><p>>The facsimile of a perfect housewife reappears on Samantha's face</p><p>>"I'm terribly sorry. It won't happen again, will it" She turns to him "Anon?"</p><p>>Anon sits there petrified, unsure if he risks bodily harm by coming between the two</p><p>>The grocery worker gives a nod and, knowing he's not paid to be a therapist, returns to his duties of restocking the pasta shelves</p><p>>The assembled crowd begins to disperse as well, some voicing out their sign-offs to a future audience</p><p>>Wait. He hasn't said his name. No-one has said his name</p><p>>She's pieced everything together. She remembers</p><p>>"How could I forget?" Samantha stares down at Anon, "I could never forget the sounds of my daughter crying until dawn"</p><p>>Anon's heart sinks, plumbing to depths yet unseen. Until dawn? When he asked her all those months ago, she refused to elaborate further than 'until she fell asleep'</p><p>>Maybe she didn't want to remember it, or maybe she didn't want to appear weak in front of him</p><p>>He has to try harder, be stronger, for her</p><p>>Samantha remembers the ordeal so clearly. This isn't not the vengeful mother Anon first saw her as. This is a mother who hasn't seen her child in years</p><p>>A mother who would do anything to find her child again, to save them from a perceived tormentor</p><p>>Whatever had happened between them has long since burnt itself out, leaving only regret</p><p>>Samantha repeats herself, "Where. Is. My. Daughter?" Anon can almost hear whistling as her voice forces itself through clenched teeth</p><p>>But, she has no reason to believe anything coming out of Anon's mouth. Anything said by him can be discarded as lies meant only to save his own skin</p><p>>She needs proof, proof that the nightmares lurking in her subconscious are only fleeting apparitions</p><p>>Anon pushes himself off the ground, grabbing at the phone in his pocket as he rises</p><p>>He quickly navigates the menus, glancing back at Samantha</p><p>>She is not pleased by the delay, her hand turning even paler as it clenches ever tighter. It's a wonder how no blood has seeped from it</p><p>>She steps forward towards Anon again, ready to finish what she had started, store policy be damned</p><p>>There's no more time. He brings up the first item on his phone before he thrusts the ceramic slab towards Samantha, stopping her midstride</p><p>>She takes it from him, suspiciously eyeing the human before her as she brings the screen up to her face</p><p>>What greets her vision is a picture the two of them took together, the start of their project</p><p>>Anon cannot remember whose idea it was, only that he was the one who bought the selfie stick for it</p><p>>A memoir of times they can compare themselves to, to show that things really are getting better</p><p>>The first photo in the album is a travesty, plastic smiles and bodies as stiff as mannequins, as if they were auditioning to be crash-test-dummies</p><p>>Judging by her reaction, this is probably the first time in years that Samantha has seen Fang</p><p>>Her shaved head, her plucked wings, her thin body with tattoos and scars spread along it</p><p>>Samantha's eyes sweep back to Anon, a mixture of shock and revulsion on her face</p><p>>Revulsion at all the suffering that he brought upon her child</p><p>>Anon motions for her to continue through the album. That wasn't the picture he wanted her to start with</p><p>>The beginning of the album is torturous. Two pessimists pretending they know what happiness looks like</p><p>>Yet, as Samantha continues through the images, they become more realized, the plastic smiles fading away to ones freely offered by their hearts</p><p>>The amount of photos increased week by week as well, as they both found more moments worth remembering</p><p>>Fang and her angelic imprint in the snow beside her, a small bird that found kinship on her wing, Anon and her sitting tandem on a motorcycle at a car show</p><p>>Every new scene chipped away at the guarded anger adorning Samantha's face, a small melancholic smile forming in its place</p><p>>The world outside dissolves away for her. All that matters is catching up on all that lost time with her daughter, committing everything she can to memory</p><p>>The few customers loitering around paid no mind to the miniature roadblock the two of them presented, though a small raptor did bump into Anon</p><p>>Too distracted trying to convince his mother that the dessert in his hands is well deserved</p><p>>Anon is pretty certain at least one customer needs something behind Samantha as well. They've passed by several times already, giving the both of them rude looks</p><p>>He's fairly confident anything that might happen between the two will be much more entertaining than anything on pay-per-view television</p><p>>A guitar sounding out through the phone's speakers draws Anon's attention back to Samantha</p><p>>This is what Anon was scrambling to show her</p><p>>Fang hadn't noticed him return home that day, too engrossed in her music to care about any errant noises in the apartment</p><p>>Chords vibrated out from the body of the guitar, her tail playing the part of a metronome as she hums a whimsical melody</p><p>>Her eyes closed to the world as a serene smile tugs at her lips</p><p>>The smile that is now mirrored almost perfectly on Samantha, but there is no serene peace to be found on her face</p><p>>The wet trails of unbound tears reflect the fluorescent lighting as she struggles to contain herself</p><p>>Long breaths drawn in and out and to ward off the trembling of her hands that threaten to send the phone tumbling to the ground</p><p>>The music dims down, coinciding with Anon leaving Fang to her music. He didn't want to ruin her moment</p><p>>He can use the video to tease her later if he feels inclined to do so</p><p>>As soon as the music halts, another song comes on</p><p>>It's familiar, yet Anon knows the video that contains that song is a long way off yet</p><p>>Did Samantha skip ahead? She looks as surprised as he is. Perhaps more so</p><p>>The only other place he uses it is... is-</p><p>>There's only one person whose ringtone is set to that song</p><p>>That's Fang</p><p>>Even if Raptor Jesus falls from the heavens to name Anon his champion, with all the god-given strength it may entail, it's too late</p><p>>Samantha is lost in her memories, in a time where her daughter still loves her, in a time before everything went wrong</p><p>>All he can do is watch as she answers the call and pulls the phone up to her head</p><p>>The exuberant yelling of a younger ptero blasts out from the device, too excited to bother checking the call's recipient</p><p>>The pure joy in Fang's voice settles the anxiety that has been in Anon's stomach since she left this morning </p><p>>One thing going right today is enough to balance out everything else</p><p>>But Samantha-</p><p>>Samantha looks like a parent listening to a recorded voice of a loved child long departed from this world</p><p>>The strength that anchored onto Anon now anchors itself on her clothing, right above her heart, her hand bleaching white under the strain</p><p>>Her teeth bared, grinding against each other as her mouth tries to split the difference between euphoria and sorrow</p><p>>Her shoulders quaking as guarded sobs leave her, scared of betraying her presence </p><p>>There's a pause, as Fang's voice dies down upon the realization that she has yet to receive any sort of response</p><p>>A muffled question sounds out from the speaker, probing for a response</p><p>>Samantha gathers her strength for an answer</p><p>>"Lucy?"</p><p>>A deafening quiet is followed by Anon's phone chirping out with a new tone</p><p>>Apprehensive muscles pull the phone away from her head, before finally placing it back where it started</p><p>>The red colour reflecting off Samantha's eyes told Anon everything he needed to know</p><p>>Fang had hung up</p><p>>A roiling storm of emotions passes over Samantha's face, none of them hinting any relief</p><p>>Fang was right there, yet stuck behind an impenetrable wall of radio waves</p><p>>The emotions finally settle, leaving a small lonely ptero in their wake</p><p>>She looks so utterly defeated, just like Fang did at that pizza chain</p><p>>...He can't leave her like that</p><p>>Anon puts his hand on Samantha's shoulder in a wordless apology</p><p>>It remains there, the matriarch not having the strength nor the will to pry away from him</p><p>>The two of them remain like that for a moment, until the phone rings out once more</p><p>>The same song, the same wayward daughter</p><p>>Samantha looks at Anon again, her eyes sweeping back and forth over him, as if to really see him</p><p>>To see the real Anon, for who he really is, without the prejudices she built up over years and years</p><p>>There is something trusting in the way she looks at him, as if she is beginning to accept that he isn't the tormentor she believes he is</p><p>>That all those photos of her daughter smiling with him are truly real</p><p>>A trembling hand holding the cellphone moves towards Anon, returning it to him</p><p>>He takes the device, tapping it to answer the call before bringing it up to his ear</p><p>>The unbound exuberance that Fang expended the first time doesn't return for this call. The excitement is still there, but it's muted</p><p>>She divulges how well everything went, how her idea was unanimously accepted, and that it was already being acted upon</p><p>>Anon's chest fills with second-hand pride as he responds with utmost joy</p><p>>In his mind's eye, he can see her tail swinging back and forth unbidden, ready to betray false emotions with her real feelings</p><p>>There is a pause before Fang continues. She says that for some reason, her first call to him was hijacked somehow</p><p>>She then suggests he call his cell provider to figure out what's going on. Having someone else answer his number is rather unnerving</p><p>>Anon's attention swings back to Samantha, who is busying herself with a handkerchief, wiping away evidence of her sorrows</p><p>>It takes a second for her to meet Anon's eyes, her eyes vibrating as if silently pleading</p><p>>Is now the time? Would it be right to chance ruining Fang's moment like this?</p><p>>He might never get another shot at reconciliation if he leaves</p><p>>"Your first call went through fine Fang." Anon draws in a breath, steeling himself "When was the last time you talked to your mom?"</p><p>>His strained heartbeat counts the time as he waits for Fang's answer, Samantha's eyes dilating as the implications of what Anon is doing reach her</p><p>>Fang's answer is quiet, vague. To Anon, it sounds like it was just before she left and set off on her own</p><p>>It really has been a long time then</p><p>>"She's right here."</p><p>>Nothing but silence greets Anon on the other end. Whatever Fang is thinking, she's keeping it to herself.</p><p>>Maybe she just needs some assurance, some support. "Everything will be fine, I'm still alive aren't I? I'll be right here, alright?"</p><p>>The noise of shuffling fabric breaks the silence on the other end, before a quiet, cautious, yet perfectly clear voice responds</p><p>>"Alright."</p><p>>Anon draws the phone away from his ear as he offers it back to Samantha</p><p>>Her smile finally reaching her eyes lets him know he's making the right choice</p><p>>She accepts the phone, bringing it back up to her head</p><p>>A quiet word is made in the softest voice imaginable, as if her daughter might shatter to dust and blow away</p><p>>"Fang?"</p><p>>Anon finally lets go of Samantha, an implicit affirmation allowing her find the space she needs </p><p>>She meanders back down the aisle, Anon a few paces behind, grabbing her shopping cart once more</p><p>>Their conversation is soft, small; filled with meaningless words that carry all the meaning in the world, as the two of them feel each other out</p><p>>Anon can only catch half of the conversation, but what he hears soothes his heart</p><p>>"How are you feeling?" "Are you eating well?" "Have you been getting enough sleep?" "Your guitar sounds lovely dear"</p><p>>Heavier topics are wisely left alone, waiting for the day when both of them are ready</p><p>>Aisle after aisle is perused, Samantha's shopping cart filling up with the basic food groups and then some</p><p>>Anon supposes that Ripley needs a lot to keep his strength up. If Fang is anything to go by, the black hole of ptero stomaches takes a lot to fill</p><p>>Before long, Anon spots Samantha looking back at him. His phone rests in her palm as she waits for him to catch up</p><p>>"Here he is dear. I'll phone later, ok?"</p><p>>As she passes the phone back to Anon, he glances at the screen, confirming that the call is still ongoing</p><p>>He brings the phone up to his head, praying that Fang isn't about to give him an earful</p><p>>"Hey."</p><p>>What greets him are the sounds of weary breathing coming from the phone. Fang is emotionally winded from the twists of today</p><p>>It's no wonder. Today's events would bring even the mighty Mr. Spears to his knees</p><p>>Anon makes the decision to drop by later and pick her up, instead of letting her take her usual bus home alone</p><p>>"I'll be by to pick you up soon, alright?"</p><p>>There's a pause in her breathing before she responds, "Alright."</p><p>>The phone chirps out, once again informing its user that the call is finished</p><p>>Its task complete, Anon pockets it</p><p>>Samantha remains in front of him, the smile he gave her still occupying her features</p><p>>She gives out her heartfelt gratitude, before extending a future dinner invitation for both him and Fang</p><p>>He'll make time for that. Besides, the only way he'll manage to negotiate a truce with Ripley is if Samantha is there acting as a mediator</p><p>>Anything less would be suicide</p><p>>Samantha makes to leave, her shopping not yet finished</p><p>>Yet, that sure is a lot of groceries</p><p>>Anon knows just how strong she is, but is she intending to bag and carry all of it to her car alone?</p><p>>He still needs to get something for Fang, but it won't take long to swing back inside after he lends a hand</p><p>>In fact, wouldn't Samantha know? Fang's tastes can't have changed that much</p><p>>Anon's query receives an enthusiastic answer from Samantha</p><p>>Dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets and some expensive barbecue sauce. How expensive is that sauce?</p><p>>Wait what? That much for barbecue sauce? Oh lord</p><p>>The laugh that comes out of the petite ptero is the first Anon has ever heard from her. It's short and sweet</p><p>>Another invitation is given to him, to come along with her so she can show him exactly what he should be looking for</p><p>>He accepts. </p><p>>The both of them can use the company</p></div>
