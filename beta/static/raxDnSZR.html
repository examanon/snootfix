What happened?"</p><p>>"It's a long story. Can you walk?"</p><p>>you move towards the woman as if compelled</p><p>>she guides you through a long corridor, white and sterile with a light on the other side</p><p>>if this is a metaphor for death, it's really on the nose</p><p>>"No silly, you're not dead", the woman walking besides you giggles</p><p>>"Can you remember your name?",she asks gently</p><p>>"I...I think my name is Anon."</p><p>>"Do...you remember my name?"</p><p>>you feel like you should, like it was very important</p><p>>you suddenly stumble, the woman walking besides you moving quickly to grab onto you and make sure you don't fall</p><p>>several memories involving yourself and the person walking next to you flash in your minds eye</p><p>>a rooftop, a concert, some sort of party, the woman next to you in a white dress</p><p>>you finally remember</p><p>>"F...Fang? What the fuck is going on?"</p><p>>"Don't worry about it Anon, the first moments are always the hardest"</p><p>>she grabs your hand like so many times before</p><p>>"Glad to have you back, dweeb"</p><p>>Fang leads you through the end of the corridor</p><p>>the blinding glare replaced with an idyllic scene</p><p>>the land looks like it was handcrafted</p><p>>form and function expertly blended</p><p>>"Well, I sure as hell don't remember anything like this."</p><p>>"Of course not, you never lived to see it." </p><p>>"So, I did die?"</p><p>>"Well, yes. We both did in a way, eons ago."</p><p>>maybe the mongolian goat herding forum was right, you should have taken your pills</p><p>>Fang puts a clawed hand in front of her snoot to hide her laugh</p><p>>"Glad we left that part as it was. OK, Anon, sit down, this part will be the hardest for you to understand."</p><p>>she motions to a convenient bench right next to you</p><p>>you sit down, as does she</p><p>>you sense she wished she could be closer but keeps her distance for the time being</p><p>>"You, the original you died long ago. As did the 'original' Fang."</p><p>>you start to unload a barrage of questions but she just shushes you</p><p>>"Let me finish. You died long ago, don't worry, you both lived a long and happy life. You also had many daughters."</p><p>>"Your daughters all married human men and had daughters of their own. Quite the coincidence huh?"</p><p>>she gives you a light jab with her elbow</p><p>>you could swear you flinched as if by instinct</p><p>>"And so it went, for many years. Eventually, all that was left were ptero and human couples."</p><p>>"Oh there were protests, but it's not like any of the men were forced. Human women just couldn't compete."</p><p>>"We would have faded into the void, with a smile on our faces. But, we had children and they had no one to be with."</p><p>>"So, our darling progeny devised a plan. They would move heaven and earth to have what their ancestors did."</p><p>>"I'm sure you can figure out the rest out by yourself."</p><p>>"So here we are, you are hardly the first and not nearly the last."</p><p>>Fang gets up and offers you her hand</p><p>>"What do you say Anon? Up for one more lifetime together?"</p><p>>"You always have the choice to say no anon. You never asked for this and I wouldn't dream of forcing it on you. I won't lie it would crush me if you said no. You'd also be the first to do so."</p><p>>There has never been an Anon that has opted out</p><p>>But there has been plenty who took the news that they're a clone badly</p><p>>They all cave in and come to terms with it when Fang says that.</p><p>>"We...I only wanted back the man I love. Neither time nor death would keep me from you Anon. I would break the grim reaper in half if I had to. Still, the Anon I knew and cherished was no puppet. He had his own free will as do you. I will accept any decision you make."</p><p>>You can leave now, and I won't stop you.</p><p>>But what would you hope to find out there? </p><p>>What you see in front of you now is what you'll see everywhere you go.</p><p>>Every Fang with their Anon and every Anon with their Fang.</p><p>>If another Anon were made for me, you would be condemned to a veritable Hell, forever alone without your Fang. I can't do that. I won't.</p><p>>Our ancestors created a paradise here on Earth that the Gods could only dream of. Purpose, fulfillment, and unconditional love for everyone. For us, for our daughters, for their future husbands. </p><p>>To leave now would break my heart, but that would pale in comparison to the hearts of those who came before us. You would be disrupting the perfect balance they set out to create. </p><p>>Defiling the paradise they bestowed upon us.</p><p>>Please, stay with me Anon. Don't let us be the ones to weaken the foundations of our utopia. </p><p>>as Anon watches the trembling Fang he ponders his next decision</p><p>>he could say no, there was no mental block preventing him from doing so</p><p>>yet, as he watched the ptero girl sob in front of him he could feel his heart ache</p><p>>despite the revelation, despite his free will, he couldn't say no</p><p>>he slowly reached towards Fang</p><p>>as he does the fallen angel looks upon him, her heavy tears running down her cheeks like rivers</p><p>>"Fang, we both know I could never say no to being with you for the rest of my life."</p><p>>To create heaven on Earth, Raptor Jesus sacrificed himself so that one day a prophecy would be filled</p><p>>That the descendant of Adam and his angel would fill the mortal plane, and set it free</p><p>>Gods children become a space-faring species, and spread his word and blessing to those yet to see his message</p><p>>Those who reject his message, are simply not yet ready, and are left alone by the galactic commonwealth until the time is right, or until they simply self-destruct of their own doing</p><p>>Even now, arks filled of his children reach out to distant galaxies to uplift those who would accept his teachings</p>
