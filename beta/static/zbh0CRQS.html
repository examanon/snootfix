<h1>Final Goodbye</h1><div><p>Title: Final Goodbye</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Samantha, Ripley </p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>There she was, your beloved daughter, little Lucy Aaran. </p><p>Your little angel, she looks as beautiful as ever. Truly head-to-toe magnificence. Always surprised you how long it took for her to find a suitor with looks like that, didn't it? Maybe you were a bit too rough on them after all.</p><p>That long, silver hair of hers, shines so brilliantly whenever the sunlight hits it. It was done up nicely, like some extra care had been put into it for this special occasion. </p><p>That slight smirk she always carried, though the two of you didn't always saw eye to eye, it always made you smile when she was. </p><p>Her wings... Bright, angelic, magnificent, just like her mother's. She's always kept them so well maintained.</p><p>She’s wearing that lovely white dress your wife had picked out for her. You remember her mentioning it as a prom dress, here it was being used once again. </p><p>It feels... odd, seeing her off this early in her life. Always seemed like it’d take so much longer for her to finally reach that point. </p><p>Taking stock of herself and settling down never seemed like her thing, after all. Though, life is full of surprises.</p><p>Just wasn't the kind of message you thought you'd get from her though. Never saw it coming at all, huh?</p><p>You think back on all the time you spent with her when she was little, all the fun games you used to play. Remember pirate princess? That was always her favorite. </p><p>All the trips and adventures the family went on. She and Naser always loved a good day at the beach.</p><p>Even if you didn't like the music, you did always love seeing her band play. Even if her bandmates were a bit... different, they made her happy, and so did playing songs all day.</p><p>She does have a wonderful singing voice, got it straight from her mother as well. Instruments seem to come to nartually to her, like they're her second language. Maybe she'll keep playing in the future.</p><p>She’s moving on now though, on to have her own adventures. She always wanted to go her own way, be her own person.</p><p>You wonder about where she’s going to go. She never really seemed to like Volcaldera that much anyway, other than her friends being here. </p><p>Ah well, guess that’s not really your decision to make. Every ptero has to leave the nest someday, right?</p><p>Of course, it'll be such a treat to see her more in the future, to spend time with your little angel once again.</p><p>You turn to your wife, she’s been at your side this entire time. She's lightly clutching your arm as she looks upon Lucy alongside you.</p><p>Poor Samantha, she’s as emotional as you are about this, but she just can’t quite hide it like you. </p><p>She's bawling at this point, tears streaming down her face and onto the floor below as she weeps.</p><p>You’re a seasoned officer of the law after all, stoicism is in your blood at this point. Some of the stuff you've handled on duty has left you fully desensitized to emotional days like this, hasn't it?</p><p>You draw her in closer, pressing her head lightly to your chest and placing a hand on the opposite side, gently holding her close. </p><p>You tell her things will be alright.</p><p>“Little Lucy is just going her separate way from us, for now.” </p><p>“We’ll both see her again soon enough, someday.” </p><p>With that, you look back to your daughter once again. </p><p>You give her a slight smirk, and a nod to go with it. A solitary tear starting to roll down your cheek.</p><p>“Take care of yourself, sweetie. I’ll be happy to see you again someday.” </p><p>"You'll always be dad's little angel, Lucy, I love you so much."</p><p>You usher Sam along, you two have taken up enough time, there are more people here to see her of course. </p><p>Besides, it’s time you go say goodbye to your son as well. </p></div>
