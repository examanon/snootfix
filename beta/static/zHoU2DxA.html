The smell of tobacco hit her like a brick. So good. She brought the stick up to her lips. It's been a long nine months since she had one of these. Besides tearing her feathers out, smoking was her favorite stress reliever. She really needed it right now. The car window is rolled down, wind flowing through her hair. What was left of it, anyways. Her eye looked in the rear-view mirror at the backseat. Still sleeping. Moving towards the left she sees Anon focused on the road. She was so lucky to have this. For a long time she figured it was lost to her, something out of her reach. She remembers the wedding like it was yesterday. The proposal, the wedding, and the birth of their child were tied for the happiest day of her life. Fragments of cigarette dropped onto her hand, reminding her of the thing in her mouth. She looked back at anon and the sleeping baby in the back before taking the cigarette out of her mouth, unused. She didn't need it anymore.</p><p>    </p><p>        The car came to a rest; they had reached their destination. Fang starting wondering if she really should've thrown that cigarette away. It wasn't difficult to find the new house, and Fang had to admit the land was rather pretty. A part of her was sad about the loss of the home she grew up in, but since she hadn't been there in years it was a bit pointless to cry over it. She and Anon got out of the car. He stretched a bit while she went to the back and picked up her little baby. Even in her barely formed state, she was the spitting image of her mother. She clutched the swaddled baby close to her bosom, her heart beating faster. She wondered if this was a bad idea. It had been so long. Still, Anon had told her everything would be alright. It was for closure, if nothing else.</p><p>        As she and Anon made their way towards the house she looked at the rather large, shady tree that sat next to the building. It provided a ring of shade under it, a reprieve from the hot summer sun. The day was bright and sunny. The whole world looked like it came straight out of a picture book; everything had a dreamlike quality to it. One of those dreams that you have and wish could last forever, a lazy and full feeling of contentedness. She could see a figure under the tree, adorned perfectly in attire befitting her task of gardening. Fang's heart quickened again when she saw them. A gray pterodactyl, long blonde hair tucked away neatly behind them.</p><p>        The pair made their way closer to the tree, the figure still not noticing them. Fang held her daughter in one hand, the other finding Anon's and giving it a squeeze. He reciprocated , and moved himself a little closer to her. He would protect her if anything went south. She was his wife and mother of his child, he would gladly give up his own life if it meant she would be safe. As if a switch was flipped the pterodactyl straightened up suddenly. A stray noise or smell carried by the gentle breeze must have alerted her to the people behind.</p><p>        She turned around, and saw the pair standing there. She turned as white as a ghost, unable to believe her eyes. Lucy? Was that really you, Lucy? Fang almost broke down into tears. Yes mom, it was really her. Samantha picked herself up and closed the distance between her and her daughter with frightening speed, wrapping her arms around the girl. Fang stepped back a bit, her motherly instincts telling her that being sandwiched between two people was decidedly not in her baby's best interests. Samantha backed off before looking down a bit and seeing what Fang was holding. The little baby turned its head a bit, snout sniffing the air curiously. The little amber eyes, replica of their mother's, opened and looked around. Samantha didn't know how to respond. She looked at the baby, and then back to Fang. Tears welled up in her eyes. Fang couldn't help but get misty eyed as well. An understanding passed between the two mothers wordlessly, a conversation that only those whose souls were tied together in one way or another could have. </p><p>"Mom, this is your granddaughter. Amber."</p></div>
