                    <p>Title: Anon And Fang And Child - Birthing Pains</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Fang, Amber</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>“That’s it babe, just a few more pushes, here we go!” </p><p>“ARUGH, FUCK YOU ANON! YOU DID THIS TO ME YOU SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!” Fang’s claws dig into my palm, the death-grip she has on my hand slowly crushing the bones to dust. I can feel blood begin to run down my arm, but it doesn’t matter. Neither do the assembled nurses or the doctor, or the harsh lights of the hospital. The only thing that matters is Fang and I, and our new baby girl about to be born.</p><p>“Remember the breathing hun,” I grimace, imitating the exercises we both learned in lemaze class. “In, and out; innnnn, and oooout. Just try to relax, Fang.”</p><p>“FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU, YOU SKINNY PIECE OF SHIT! HOW ABOUT I COME OVER THERE AND SHOVE A WATERMELON OUT OF YOUR DICK!”</p><p>Yep, I think I can hear my bones begin to snap.</p><p>“She’s crowning! Just a little more Fang, come on, push!” The doctor gives an encouraging smile, peering over the temporary curtain that has formed from Fang’s legs up in the stirrups. Fang gives another ear-piercing shriek, her hand tightly clenched in mine as she screws up all her energy for one final push.</p><p>At once, the most wonderful sound in the world hits my ears: A tiny wail, one that starts off slow and quiet, but gains in strength as it continues. The cry of a newborn baby; OUR newborn baby. </p><p>“There we go, she’s out! Ten toes and fingers, good, good. Congratulations you two, she looks totally healthy.” Quickly handing our most precious object in the world to a nurse, the doctor snips the umbilical cord with practiced ease. I glance up at Fang, brushing her hair out of her eyes as tears of happiness begin to streak down my cheeks. The strain of childbirth has taken its toll on her: Fang’s hair is a mess, slick with sweat and plastered to her face, and her amber eyes are half-open from exhaustion. But still she smiles, that same soft smile she’s shone me so many times before.</p><p>“Let me see her,” Fang sighs, reaching out a hand slick with my blood towards the nurse. “Let me see my sweet baby girl…” Her voice is eerily quiet. I expected Fang to be hoarse from the scream, but this… No, something else is wrong. Fang’s eyes flutter shut, her outstretched hand slumping to the bed. She looks pale, as if the very spark of life within her is fading fast. Somewhere, the sharp staccato of a hospital alarm begins to blare. </p><p>“She’s ruptured! Quick, get her into surgery!” The doctor parks orders to the nursing team, moving quickly to wheel Fang’s bed out off the room. </p><p>“Fang? Fang!” The nurse wrapping my hand with gauze restrains me as I fight to get to Fang. “No, I won’t leave her! I WON’T!” I try to rip my arm free, but the nurse’s grip is an iron bar. Elsewhere in the room, our newborn continues to cry out for her mother, but I pay her no mind. Right now, all my thoughts are focused on my wife.  </p><p>“Sir, please, you have to stay calm!” Another nurse takes my other arm, pushing me back down into the uncomfortable hospital chair. I catch one last glimpse of Fang through the doorway before she’s wheeled down the hall. She looked so small, so helpless, like a fragile doll that’s been thrown against the wall. Hot tears begin to spill down my cheeks, tears of anger and sadness and everything else that should be absent from this special day.</p><p>“FANG!” I manage to free my arm at last, reaching out my own blood-slicked hand towards the only woman I’ve ever loved as she is wheeled away from me, forever. </p><p>A life for a life.  </p>
