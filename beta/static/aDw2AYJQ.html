You regret eating so many of the Olive Snoot breadsticks now, but you refuse to say anything. Don’t want her to start saying “I told you so, dweeb” again. Your beautiful ptero wife excuses herself from your company, giving you a kiss on the cheek. You close your eyes and keep them closed, trying to remember the feeling of the kiss on your cheek as the sensation left behind begins to fade. You hear the bathroom door shut behind you.</p><p>    </p><p>      Hard to believe it’s been four years of marriage already. People always told the two of you that it wouldn’t be sunshine and puppy dogs forever, and that soon the honeymoon phase would end and the arguments would come. Those people could also be invited to give a food review of their shoes, as far as you were concerned. While a few minor scuffles happened from time to time, constant couples therapy and good old fashioned plain honesty seemed to ease most any problem before it spiraled out of control. You remember the advice an elderly coworker had told you when you asked his opinion – “Honesty, Respect, and a lot of sex.” You were partial to the last one.</p><p>      Your head swims with the alcohol you washed down your faux Italian dinner with. The both of you had drained dry about three glasses of wine by your count, maybe four. You had the foresight to call an Uber to pick and drop you off so as to avoid any tragic accidents. Wouldn’t do for the lovebirds to be killed on the day of their 4th anniversary. Ripley and Sam had surprised the two of you with a few gifts. Ripley had spared some money which, although welcome, rubbed you the wrong way slightly. It’s not like your job couldn’t provide for the two of you. You decided to not look a gift horse in the mouth however and accepted it. You think back to your mother-in-law. She always had some quip about grandchildren and you were beginning to suspect she wasn’t just joking around anymore. The sound of water pattering against the shower floor briefly interrupts your thoughts. Should you go in and join her? You debate the pros and cons, deciding against it. Your fingers drum along your stomach as your mental-vision darkens and the clutches of sleep threaten to drag you under. You jerk awake a little, your body rejecting that idea. Stretching, you turn on the television and flip around a bit. The water has stopped now. Eventually, your wife comes out with naught but a towel on, collapsing onto the couch beside you.</p><p>      Your head finds itself against her neck, breathing deeply – and loudly. “Mmm. I like that.” You say, hearing Lucy giggle a bit. “I figured you’d like the new soap.” Your nose and lips drag along her neck, her hand snaking back behind your own neck and scratching with her talons. You let out another pleasured grunt, really letting her know how much you enjoy it, before you pull away. You don’t go far however, as her hand hasn’t removed itself from your neck. Her soft, wet eyes stare back into yours. “Y’know, I was thinking…” She starts cautiously. “Hm?” “It’s our anniversary and all…” She says, a smile twitching at the corner of her mouth, eyelids dropping halfway. Awooga. Her hand produces the familiar square, pink-wrapped shape of a condom. Yes, please. The two of you kiss a few more times, chests pressing up against one another. Your hands undo her towel, eager to reach the soft flesh hidden behind. A few minutes of groping and pawing and the two of you are in the mood. You take the condom from her and begin to tear the corner when you notice it. You stop, and you could swear she stops breathing. You squint your eyes, looking closer at the wrapping. No, it’s not a trick of the light. There’s marks on it. Several, in fact. Truth be told, they look a lot like…</p><p>      Your eyes slowly turn upwards from the sabotaged condom in your hands to Lucy’s. She shifts uncomfortably, nervously swallowing. “You….” You start, anger playing faintly in your voice. That’s underhanded. Dishonest. She’s your wife, you’re her husband. Yeah, the talk of kids has come around before, but the two of you never really went into detail about it. You feel betrayed. … but also a little turned on. She wants…. She was going to…. You pants feel tighter. This is wrong. You shouldn’t reward this behavior. “You….” You start again. Your eyes dance across her body, the alcohol probably clouding your judgement. Her breasts look so full, the light glistening off of them. The smell of the soap mixing with that of her natural scent, the intoxicating aroma filling your mind. Her supple, naked body laying in front of you. Ripe for the taking. Ripe for breeding. She wants to bear your children. She wants you to make her a mother.</p><p>      “You’re lucky I’m into that.” Shock starts to from on her face but she doesn’t have time for it to fully manifest before your lips find hers. Your tongue violently pushes into her mouth as your head pushes hers back to the soft couch. Her hands wrap around you, pulling you tighter. Your hands struggle through hers, pulling your pants down as well as your undergarments. She practically tears your shirt off of you. She opens her legs invitingly and your heart freezes. This is the point of no return. Are you sure you want to do this? Your eyes glance across her body again, the body of the woman you love. The body that’s begging you to perform your marital duties. The thoughts of little feet pattering through the hallways dance through your mind. Thoughts of picking up your children on your shoulders, of waking up on Fathers Day to a horribly made breakfast you’ll eat anyways. To seeing the results of pregnancy show on her body. You smile. Of course you’re sure.</p></div>
