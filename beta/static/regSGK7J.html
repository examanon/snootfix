What remained of the smoldering embers of Trish’s fury were currently directed towards the pink raptor, his much longer legs allowing him to push through the drifts of not-quite-snow with realitive ease. Damn Anon! Why did his house have to have that most disgusting of human characteristics, dandruff?</p><p>At first, it had been fun, playing in the dandruff with Reed. Anon wasn’t there, instead asleep in his room. He hadn’t necessarily invited them over, so-to-speak, but as the sky began disgorging its bounty of white, Trish and Reed decided they might as well spend some time playing while waiting for him to wake up. It was Reed’s idea to masquerade as Dirty Dino first, and Trish couldn’t resist the temptation to put him into place. She was damned if she was going to be Pinhead again! Unfortunately, their roughhousing had attracted the attention of Anon; who, still half-asleep, had stormed out of his room and beat the living shit out of the both of them, burying them in a shallow grave of white. So, Trish had decided to get the fuck out of there, and forget what Fang or Anon would think!</p><p>Panting, the VVURM DRAMA duo finally manage to reach the entrance, the massive steel door Anon had fitted to protect himself from Skin Row crazies looming above them (well, above Trish). Shouldering her friend out of the way, Trish heaved at the peculiar wheel-shaped handle, her muscles straining as she twisted with all her might. </p><p>“Urgh…Fuck!” Gritting her teeth, Trish doubled-down on her attempts to open their way to freedom, Reed standing silently behind her. The handle was covered in some unfamiliar excretions, no doubt some disgusting skinny residue that Anon had failed to clean off. Suddenly, Trish’s hands slipped, her momentum sending her fists smacking straight into Reed’s face.</p><p>“Ow!” Reed exclaimed, a good second or two after Trish had made contact. Trish wasn’t sure if he was just saying ow to spare her feelings (she knew she wasn’t as strong as she looked), or if he was just too stoned to care.</p><p>“Sorry Reed, but the door is locked!” Trish pointed at the door handle, where a semi-transparent mucus had covered the lock completely. They were trapped!</p><p>“Let me have a try.” Brows furrowing, Reed strolled with the upmost confidence past his diminutive friend, chest puffed out and shoulders squared. Pausing in front of the door, Reed spat dramatically on both his palms. Trish could feel a flutter of excitement in her chest: Reed was stronger than he looked, and with the amount of carfe current coursing through his powerful, thick veins, there was no way he could fail! Squaring up with the door, Reed throw his arms back, his sinuous biceps flexing as he prepared his own attempt at opening the door. This was going to work! This was-</p><p>“Open sesame!” Reed shouted, at the same time thrusting his hands forward dramatically. Trish stared, open-mouthed, her expression flying from rage to sadness and back to rage in the span of a microsecond. The door remained resolutely shut. Shrugging, Reed walked back to Trish, the purple Trigger’s face incandescent with rage.</p><p>“Well, I’ve done all I can do.” </p></div>
