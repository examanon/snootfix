You’re speaking too loud.”</p><p>>She’s as red as an apple, practically a fiery mess after what I say.</p><p>>She quickly glances around before turning back to me.</p><p>>”You fucking noticed?”</p><p>>Oh no.</p><p>>Oh god the alarms are blaring right now in my head.</p><p>>Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckdon’tbearetard</p><p>>”M-maybe…?”</p><p>>She grits her teeth before sighing, dejected.</p><p>>”Okay, you should know now since we’ve been dating for...a bit.”</p><p>>Her head suddenly jerks up, realizing something as she smooshes me harder into the wall.</p><p>>”B-But not right now! After school! Got it, asshole?”</p><p>>”Uh...sure.”</p><p>>She quickly walks down the hall, still slightly red from her embarrassment of her secret being found out.</p><p>>Ah shit, I fucked up.</p><p>>Shouldn’t have pointed it out but fuck it, this is my life now.</p><p>>Next few classes are a bit of a blur of thoughts to me.</p><p>>Like I just walked into her changing.</p><p>>Or more accurately finger blasting herself.</p><p>>Wait, no, too far on that one.</p><p>>Fang isn’t taking it the hottest either, looking like she’s about to die from embarrassment.</p><p>>Wait, was she doing it TODAY too?</p><p>>Did I just ruin her whole day because I noticed-</p><p>>Before I can feel my brain melt out of my skull from my thoughts, my last class finishes, the blaring of the bell signaling us to go.</p><p>>I take my things and exit through the door, seeing Fang following suit.</p><p>>Raptor Jesus I’m gonna get grilled, give me strength.</p><p>>She waves a hand at me before signalling me to go with her.</p><p>>Part of me honestly wants to say I had no idea what I was talking about earlier and bolt, but fuck it, I dug my own grave here.</p><p>>I go and follow her and we get to a secluded spot under a tree that’s a bit away from the school grounds.</p><p>>She sighs, and sits down at the foot of it before taking out a cigarette.</p><p>>”Sit, you idiot.”</p><p>>I just realized I’ve been standing over and said nothing since we started walking here.</p><p>>I quickly apologize and sit beside her, and she offers me one too.</p><p>>I decline and she takes a quick drag before saying something.</p><p>>”OkaymaybeIlikewalkingaroundnaked”</p><p>>I blink.</p><p>>”I...what?”</p><p>>She grits her teeth before quickly looking pissed off at something.</p><p>w>”I-I just like walking around naked!”</p><p>>It’s still not processing with me.</p><p>>I can feel my inner hamster wheel turning in my brain but it's still not clicking.</p><p>>”What, like in your room? But not in public right? Youjust couldn’t find underwear before you came to school, right?”</p><p>>She gives a giant glare at me while I look at her confused.</p><p>>Suddenly it clicks.</p><p>>Well less of a click and more of getting hit in the head with a brick.</p><p>>It’s a bad analogy but it works for right now.</p><p>>”You have a...exhibitionist fetish?”</p><p>>She throws her hands forward to her sides, relieved that my retard brain finally worked it out.</p><p>>Sorry Fang, I haven’t updated my brain’s processing power in five years.</p><p>>”Yes! Jeeze, you’re slow sometimes!”</p><p>>She huffs before taking another drag.</p><p>>”Look it...it just feels good, y’know? It’s like taking a hot shower or whatever.”</p><p>>She shakes her head, showing a small frown.</p><p>>”Crap, I knew it was a bad idea to do it today.”</p><p>>Fuck, act fast or else this could go downhill.</p><p>>”I think it’s kinda hot.”</p><p>>FUCK</p><p>>She quickly jolts her head up looking at me, beet red.</p><p>>”W-Wait, really?”</p><p>>Okay, slow down anon, you’re gonna choke at some point-</p><p>>”Yeah, I think it’s pretty hot. Seeing you walking around in a skirt or something like that without underwear on or whatever.”</p><p>>WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING SLOW DOWN</p><p>>”Honestly it’s kinda empowering that you do something like that. Really sticking it to the man, y’know?”</p><p>>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p><p>>Fang’s mouth is agape, looking at me like I’m suddenly talking in a different language.</p><p>>I feel like I’m possessed by a demon as I continue.</p><p>>And hoo boy, it’s not letting go soon.</p><p>>”Like there’s this stigma against letting yourself be free to just experience the winds of Earth and bustle of the city while stark naked, getting the thrill of nonchalantly walking around or barely escaping getting caught. That’s how you feel right?”</p><p>>She nods slowly, keeping the same face.</p><p>>I hold her hand as I finish.</p><p>>”Look, Fang. I get it, and hell, I’d even go far as to say help you with it. I love you, and want you to be happy. And so what if you have an odd kink? If it makes you happy then it makes me happy.”</p><p>>I smile warmly after what I consider to be the worst thing I have ever said.</p><p>>It takes a few seconds before she responds quietly.</p><p>>”I...wow.”</p><p>>This is it.</p><p>>She’s gonna realize I’m too autistic for her own good and run.</p><p>>Fang suddenly jumps at me, quickly hugging me while she’s got me pinned to the ground as I’m still shook from surprise.</p><p>>”Holy shit, someone understands!”</p><p>>What.</p><p>>She hugs a bit tighter before quickly letting go, blushing slightly.</p><p>>”Uh, I mean, yeah. And uh, sorry.”</p><p>>I exhale before sitting back up.</p><p>>”It’s fine.”</p><p>>It was, in fact, not fine.</p><p>>She was right on top of me.</p><p>>A GIRL was on top of me.</p></div>
