                    <p>Garden of Rosa</p><p>​</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Tonight is the big night: Prom. The stuffiness of the cab reduces me to a puddle of sweat in a cheap suit, but I don’t dare roll the windows down. It already took a bit of mending to get Dad’s old tux up to snuff, and I don’t want to ruin it with the dust from Rosa’s gravel drive. Bad enough I couldn’t catch a ride with Stella out here. Gritting my teeth against the heat, I swore nothing was going to spoil this night for us.</p><p>Handing the cabbie the fare, I try to ignore his smug smile and comments about how best to avoid prom night disasters as I exit the yellow sweatbox. Rosa’s house is already busy, and I spot Stella’s car among the many parked in the open-air garage. She graciously offered to be our ride for tonight, although I think it was just so she can show off her prom date to the both of us; when Stella blurted out that it was the star player of the football team, our mouths nearly hit the floor. Knocking on the front door, I could hear familiar voices inside quiet somewhat as someone rushed to answer; it seemed most of Rosa’s family was over once more to see us off. Rosa’s dad opened the door, greeting me with a smile and a thunderous pounding on my back.</p><p>“Ay, An-on, welcome, welcome! Make yourself at home: Stella and her novio are in the kitchen, helping la esposa with the last of the food.” </p><p>“The food?” I ask, carefully pulling out the corsage I had procured for Rosa from my jacket pocket. Thank you, five-finger discount…</p><p>“Si, Rosa and her madre were making food for the prom! Seemed there was a last-minute cancelation and my little Bebita jumped at the opportunity.” Rosa’s dad beamed with fatherly pride as he ushered me into the kitchen where Stella and her tank of a date were waiting. “Ah, what a sweet kid…”</p><p>“And yet, who is stuck here finishing all of the food, eh?” Rosa’s mom gave me a welcoming smile and wave from behind the mountain of take-out containers she was filling. “Anon, good to see you. Grab a spoon and start filling.” Several other realatives greeted me from their own spots around the kitchen, a veritable production-line of food preparation spanning the generations of Rosa’s family.</p><p>Rolling up my sleeves, I started loading up the delicious-smelling food into the various plastic and Styrofoam containers. From the sheer volume of food, I wondered if there would even be room in Stella’s car for the four of us, not to mention the size of the lad Stella was with. Jeez, what an absolute unit. I chatted with Stella as we filled, scooped and ladled, passing the time by complementing her on her dress and hair.</p><p>“Thanks Anon! Ohmygosh, wait to you see Rosa, she is soooooo cute!” Stella’s bubbly demeanor did little to quell my own nervousness. God, I hope I looked good enough for Rosa… “Did’ja know she made her own dress?”</p><p>“You look pretty good too, babe.” Despite his enormous size, Stella’s date spoke with a careful, almost shy voice. Stella blushed under his attention, and when no one but me was looking, reached over to pinch his bottom! </p><p>“He won’t have to wait long , eh? An-on, here she comes!” Rosa’s dad tapped me on the shoulder, directing me to the hall where Rosa’s room lay. Washing my hands quickly, I eagerly awaited Rosa’s arrival at the kitchen entrance, trying to sooth my nerves by straightening my bow-tie. The sound of the door opening heralded Rosa’s arrival, and then…</p><p>“Hola, An-on! So, how do I look?” </p><p>Simply put, Rosa looked stunning: Her dress was magnificent, the huge ruffled skirt resembling an enormous rose in full bloom. The bodice of her dress fit her snugly, vines of roses wrapping around the tight white silk only helping to accentuate Rosa’s curves and plunging cleavage. Rosa’s hair was laced with what looked like drops of starlight, shimmering in the light of the hallway as she twirled around. “Mama helped me make it. Isn’t it lovely, the way it flows! Oh, and the flowers!” Rosa ran her hands down her body, clearly pleased with the work she had done.</p><p>“I think Anon likes it very much, Rosa.” The voice of Rosa’s mom directly behind me snapped me out of my ogling, reminding me to put my eyes on Rosa’s face, not the rest of her. Under her mom’s watchful glare, I pinned Rosa’s corsage to her wrist, feeling myself going pale as Rosa hugged me. God, the way her dress lifted her chest…</p><p>“Ahem!” Rosa’s mom grinned wickedly at the two of us, wielding a digital camera and about a dozen additional SD cards. We both groaned, sharing a look of universal childhood exasperation. “Come on you two, it’s time for pictures.” </p><p>***</p><p>Somehow, the four of us had managed to fit into Stella’s car, along with about a ton of homemade food. After a considerable time, we managed to finally unload our precious cargo, hauling it inside. Chinese lanterns dotted the celling, matching the decorations that we saw outside, giving the entire prom a decided Far-East look. Glancing over to where the buffet table had been set up, I could indeed tell that it was empty, whatever catering company that had been hired clearly leaving the school high and dry at the last minute. As the smell of the food wafted before us, dozens of hungry students began to crowd around, licking their lips in anticipation. Eyeing the crowd, I didn’t see any sign of Fang or Reed. I really needed to talk to them before…</p><p>“Rosa? Rosa!” The bellowing voice of Principal Spears rose over the up-tempo music of the gymnasium, dulling the excited chatter of the crowd. I could see Spears heading towards us, cutting through the assembled students like some great white shark dispersing lesser, more hungry fish. I manage a nod towards the hulking man in greeting, laboring under about a dozen heavy trays of food.</p><p>“Evening, Principal Spears.” </p><p>“Hola, Principal Spears! Sorry we were late, mi madre had us taking more pictures than I thought.” Rosa began handing Spears tray after tray of delicious food she has painstaking prepared. She mentioned in the car that she had been cooking since yesterday evening! All that work, just to feed her fellow students. </p><p>“I’m just glad you came when you did, Rosa. Here, let me help you set up the food.” Spears took my own trays as well, clearly having no issue handling an amount of food that probably weighed as much as I did. “I was afraid we were going to have a riot on our hands if these kids didn’t get something to eat soon.” Spears turns back into the crowd, several pairs of hungry eyes following him intently. “Rosa, do you mind helping me set these out?”</p><p>“Lo siento, An-on, but I’ll just be a moment, okay?” Rosa gives me a peck on the cheek, collecting the remaining trays in her arms. “Go enjoy yourself! Maybe you can go say hi to Fang for me?” </p><p>“Sure, don’t worry about it, Rosa.” She gives me another smile before heading off to join Spears at the catering table. I couldn’t help but get an eyeful of Rosa’s low-cut back as she sauntered away, her high-heels giving her already ample backside another boost. Damn, she really looks radiant in that dress… </p><p>Chuckling, I scan the crowd once more, trying to find Fang. I hoped to catch her before the band starts playing, and I’m surprised she’s not among the ravenous students mobbing the buffet station. However, something else catches my eye, however; a sad little purple figure alone at a table in the back, blankly staring at her phone. Trish looks absolutely miserable, her sad face clashing with her sparkling black dress and golden horn ornaments. I thought her and Fang had reconciled? Something clearly was on her mind, with the way she was pouting, all alone.</p><p>Ugh, I didn’t feel like playing therapist again, especially at prom.</p><p>Several slow songs later, I return to the table where Trish and I talked, grateful there was still some food left at the buffet. Dancing with Trish was… nice, even if she was upset. Turns out, there was a last-minute set-list change, one that Trish did not like in the slightly. She said she was feeling pushed out of her own band, but I think she just needed a comforting shoulder for a while, someone who would listen as she blew off some steam.</p><p>Munching away at Rosa’s homecooked food, I once again scanned the crowd, this time for signs of my girlfriend. I hadn’t seen her since she and Spears went off to set up the food, and I hoped she hadn’t been mobbed by the hungry pack of teenagers that descended on the buffet table. Getting an impromptu dance lesson from Trish was great and all, but I really wanted to spend the rest of prom with the girl who I came with. </p><p>With no Latina ankylosaur in sight, I resigned myself to the food once more, the sappy sad love song currently blasting out onto the dance floor only making my heart sink further. I fumbled out my phone, fingers automatically moving to text Rosa before I remembered that there were no pockets in that dress of hers, and her purse was at the coat check. Damnit, where could she be?</p><p>“Guess who, mi amor?” Almost as if by request, a pair of gentle hands cover my eyes from behind. This close, I could smell Rosa’s perfume, the sweet scent banishing all my previous insecurities. Rosa’s hands moved to my shoulders as she leaned down towards me, greeting me with a kiss before taking the seat next to me. </p><p>“Ay, sorry An-on, it was a madhouse over there! It took Spears and I a while to restore order, and I do no think those pinche gringos liked waiting in line.” Rosa tucked an errant strand of hair behind her ear, adjusting the bodice of her dress with the other hand as she did so. “I swear, if one more imbécil so much as thinks of… What? An-on, what is it?”</p><p>I realize I had been staring at Rosa this whole time, a goofy smile creeping up my face. But how could I not? The way her face shone slightly with sweat, the way her hair shimmered in the light: Rosa was probably the most beautiful girl at the prom tonight. Without a doubt the most beautiful person in my life, anyways.</p><p>“Nah, it’s nothing. Come on, let’s dance!” Before Rosa could protest, I pulled her up, leading her by both hands to the dance floor. We found a space easily, and just as Trish taught me earlier, I settled my hand around Rosa’s waist, taking her hand in mine. Position assumed, we began to dance, my slow, careful movements leading Rosa’s more practiced steps. Rosa’s crimson eyes bored into me, her smoky eyeshadow only enhancing how gorgeous she looked. Now, that sappy love song didn’t sound so bad.</p><p>The first song eventually faded away, replaced by a slightly faster, but equally sappy, pop number. Rosa followed my lead, our feet sashaying across our space on the dance floor. Unlike before, where Trish and I had talked while we danced, Rosa and I danced in silence, enjoying one another’s company for the first time tonight. I could feel myself beginning to redden as Rosa and I stared at each other, giggling, the pure happiness we both felt spreading across our faces.</p><p>“An-on, you’re pretty good at this!” Rosa said as we continued into the third song, giving my hand a squeeze as we slowly rotated in tune with the music. I was careful to shuffle my feet, making sure not to step on any part of Rosa’s voluminous dress. “You know, Papi said I would always end up with a man who knew how to dance. “</p><p>“Ah, well, you can thank Trish for that.”  Rosa and I got closer, the petal-like ruffles of her dress swishing against my pants.  “She uh… She kinda’ had to teach me tonight.” I let my hand explore the smoothness of Rosa’s dress, brushing her bare skin ever so slightly as I did so. The beginnings of a frown start to crease Rosa’s brow, her smile turning sour.</p><p>“Aww, I didn’t get your first dance?”” Rosa’s pouting only enhanced her beauty, but from the way her brows were starting to knit together, I knew a tirade was beginning to form. Students glanced our way as Rosa’s voice took on more heat. “I was looking forward to that. Did Trish plan this, hmmm? Trying to steal you away, that maldita pequeña purpura-mmpf!” I cut Rosa off with a kiss, pressing her into my body as I did so. I kept the kiss quick, pulling back nearly as quickly as I had started, leaving Rosa confused and breathless. “Ay, you chico tonto!” What was that for?”</p><p>Smiling, I continued swaying to the music. Nothing was going to spoil this moment for us. “Because! Nothing is going to make you sad tonight, Rosa. I won’t allow it. And no, Trish did not steal me away,” I continued, laughing as Rosa blushed slightly with jealousy. “Tonight, you deserve to be the happiest woman in the world, and I’m going to do everything to make sure it-mmpf!</p><p>It was Rosa’s turn to take me by surprise, moving her hand from my shoulder to the back of my head to pull me down into her. Her kiss was tender at first, almost like the first kiss we shared, but soon it grew more and more intense, feeding off our passion. Rosa’s tongue slipped hesitantly into my mouth as the kiss continued, slowly teasing my teeth before sloppily rolling around my mouth. I couldn’t say how we danced like that, bodies pressed against one another, mouths locked in love’s eternal embrace, but it wasn’t until a ripple of chatter spread through the students that either of us noticed the music had stopped.</p><p>Blushing, the two of us broke apart, trying not to meet the eyes of the students around us as Spears took the stage. For once, the enormous man held a microphone, his massive hand easily dwarfing the small object. Rosa and I stood there; our little fingers hooked together as Spears began his announcement.</p><p>“Good evening Volcano High!” Spears paused, letting the assembled students cheer. Rosa even added her own trilling exultation to the mix. “I’ve got a few announcements before we end tonight, and you all go home safely.” Spears’ exaggerated glare brought on a few nervous laughs, everyone no doubt picturing an angry Spears suplexing a would-be party goer who didn’t abide by the rules. “First thing is- “From somewhere behind his lapel, Spears produced a small golden envelope. “Prom King and Queen!” </p><p>I roll my eyes, laughing as I catch sight of Naser being pulled towards the stage by the tangerine terror. Rosa rests her head on my shoulder, moving her hand to stroke my back as we wait for the foregone conclusion. Another waft of her perfume draws me closer to her.</p><p>“And now! Your winners, for the one Mil, twenty-twenty class, aaaaaaaaaaaaare: Naaaaaaser and Naaaaooomiiii!”</p><p>Spears pulls two crowns from a pocket as the class erupts in celebratory chaos. Despite everything Naomi has attempted to pull this year, I still give them a polite applause; Naser at least deserves it. Naomi is, of course, acting beside herself with joy, donning the tiara with her trademark fake smile. I wouldn’t even have put it past her to fix the voting to ensure her victory.</p><p>Taking the microphone, Naomi clears her throat, easing back into her role as the perfect prom queen. “Thank you all so much, Volcano High!” Naomi begins, her well-rehearsed speech sounding just as fake as the rest of her attitude. “My, I don’t really have a speech prepared, but…” </p><p>Spears buts in, gently pulling the mic away from a rather shocked Naomi. “Thanks, you two, but unfortunately we’ve got to stay on schedule and have one more thing planned for tonight.” Naser pulls a distraught and fuming Naomi off to the side of the stage, his own prom crown dangling from his head crest. Oh, how the tables have turned… </p><p>“I know many of you know these next three, and their first concert was a…mixed affair, but I think they’ve all shone us how important a second chance can be. Let’s give it up fooooooooor: VVURM DRAMA!” </p><p>Spears marches off-stage, leading a decidedly subdued applause as the red curtains draw open to reveal the band, wielding their instruments. Fang stands at the front in a brilliant purple dress, a look of nervous trepidation creeping across her face, and Trish looked smaller than ever trying to hide behind her bass. Reed, like usual, didn’t seem to notice much of anything. Murmurs ripple through the students, many of whom have whipped out their phones, no doubt thinking to record another meltdown. Rosa and I cheer encouragingly, however, waving to catch the band’s attention from our spot on the edge of the dance floor. Finally catching a look at us, Fang smiles, her confidence rising as she strides right up to the mic stand.</p><p>“Goodnight, Volcano High! We’re VVURM DRAMA, and we’re here…” Fang stums a chord on her guitar, instantly silencing the murmurs of the crowd. “To blow you away!”</p><p>“¡Dios mío! Ayyy, An-on, that was so much fun!” An excited Rosa twirls in front of me as we exit the gymnasium with the rest of the class. VVURM DRAMA had been an absolute hit, performing even better than they did at Dino-Moe’s. I could see why Trish was upset about the set-list: It had been mostly safe pop-rock tunes, with a few sanitized originals thrown in. The band’s practice was on full display, and the crowd still buzzed with energy after such a good performance.</p><p>“Yeah, for sure! Fang and the gang really knocked it out of the park, huh?” Rosa joined me as we waited by the ticket booth, both of us still tapping out feet in tune to the band’s music. Stella, our ride for the evening, had told us to wait for her here. Her and her date had really torn it up on the dance floor, even reenacting the iconic scene from Dirty Dancing. I still couldn’t believe she got the captain of the football team to take her to prom!</p><p>“Si, I could no believe it either. But, Stella is very persuasive when she wants to be.” Me and my damn mumbling. Rosa hung onto my shoulder with one hand, fanning herself with the other. We had both been dancing so hard during VVURM DRAMA’s set we were covered in sweat. I tried not to notice how the beads of perspiration rolled slowly down Rosa’s ample cleavage, making her breasts glisten in the dim light of the evening…</p><p>“Uhh… D-did Stella say how long she would be?” </p><p>“No, just that we should wait for her here. I hope she did no forget about… ¿!Ay, Me estás tomando el pelo!? Look, An-on!” </p><p>Rosa’s accusatory finger directed me to the side of the gyn, where a VERY occupied Stella was currently playing tonsil-touch with her prom date. Raptor Jesus, Stella was even grabbing his…!</p><p>“Oooh, that little…” Rosa half-started towards them, rolling up imaginary sleeves as her eyes shot daggers at her one-time friend.</p><p>“Chill, Rosa!” I managed to turn Rosa back to me, the angry ankylosaur still glaring over her shoulder. “I’ll just call us a cab, okay?” I waved my phone for emphasis, the number of the cab company already typed in. “We’ll get home, no worries at all.”</p><p>“Fine!” Rosa spat acidly, turning away from Stella with a decided ‘humpf!’ “But Stella and I will have words when I see her tomorrow, believe me! The nerve of that girl, trying to…”    </p><p>Smiling, I let Rosa vent, knowing better than to interrupt. Even without Stella, my plan would still work. In fact, it may even work out better/</p><p>“An-on, where are we going?” The cab sped onwards, down dark streets and running through stop signs like they were nothing. The familiar cab driver flashed me a toothy grin in the rear-view mirror, looking like he was about to start blabbing away again. I had already alluded to him what I was planning when he dropped me off at Rosa’s house before prom started, and the asshole had nearly blurted it out when we got in the cab! If he spoiled the surprise now, I swear to god…</p><p>“It’s just a little post-prom hangout at the arboretum Rosa. Fang and Reed planned it.” While technically not a lie, I knew Rosa could tell I was stretching the truth a little. “I wanted it to be a surprise, that’s why I didn’t tell you, sorry!” Hopefully a little preemptive guilt can throw her off the trail.</p><p>“Hmm… It’s okay An-on, but why did you no tell me? Couldn’t we have gotten a ride with Reed?” </p><p>Shit, come up with something quick! </p><p>“Yeah, but Reed’s van? Do you want to smell like THAT, coming home late at night?” </p><p>Rosa nodded her head, conceding that no, she did not in fact want to smell like stale socks and body-odor when coming home after Prom. And whatever else Reed would inevitable be smoking.</p><p>Heh, diversion successful.</p><p>The cab arrived quickly at the arboretum, skidding to a halt right at the front gates. I sprang out quickly, offering a hand to help Rosa with her billowing dress as she climbed out. After tossing some cash to the driver and watching him speed off the wrong way down a one-way street, we headed towards the entrance. Technically, the arboretum wasn’t open at night, but with only a short bar to jump over, it was no trouble sneaking in.</p><p>“Ay, An-on, are you sure this is the place? I mean, I do no hear nobody out here, and it’s so dark…” Rosa wrapped her arms around mine, snuggling closer as we walked the lonely paths. It was pretty dark, the unlit walkways stretching out into the darkness forebodingly. With only our phone lights to guide us, it took me a few moments to find the right path to our destination.</p><p>“They said they’d meet us at the gazebo. See, those lights up ahead?” I shoot Rosa a sly smile, knowing full well she can’t see my smug expression in the dark. I point in the dark towards the crest of the hill, where a halo of light is visible through the gloom. “Reed’s even got the music set up, listen!” </p><p>Rosa cocked her head, just barely visible in the night. Faint music could indeed be heard, echoing through the silent park from the top of the hill where the gazebo sat. It had a decidedly Latin flare, easily picked up by Rosa’s attuned ears. And my ears as well, now. “Si, si, I hear it now. But what is that? I do no think Reed liked that sort of stuff…” </p><p>“I asked him to play it, special like.” We were half-way to the top of the hill, the gentle rise of the hill bringing us closer and closer to the light. “Just something for us, Rosa. Nearly there now, mi amor.” </p><p>Rosa redoubled her grip on my arm. The shiver running through her body makes me mistake it for fear at first; but, now that my eyes had adjusted somewhat to the night, I could see that it wasn’t from fear, but from recognition. </p><p>“An-on, that’s…” Rosa’s voice caught in her throat. We were nearly at the top now, the light from the gazebo strong enough now that we didn’t really need our phones. The music could be heard clearly now, the quiet tune easily recognizable now. </p><p>‘En el desierto un viajero de amor desesperado queria morir…’</p><p>“I found an old copy online, and, well, one burned CD later, we were in business.” I took Rosa’s hands as I lead her up the last few feet of the hill, my back to the gazebo. “I hope you don’t think it’s too cheesy, Rosa, but…”</p><p>The gazebo was strung up with fairy lights, a brilliant twinkling ring illuminating the scene below. A white sheet was laid over the park bench, on top of which sat Reed’s old boombox, which I had borrowed for this occasion. Dozens of bouquets of Rosa’s favorite flowers were set up around the bench, stuffed in as many mis-matched vases as Fang and Trish could lend me. Candles lined the gazebo’s railing, each one the best of Stella’s collection, or so she claimed. I had worked hard to make it as romantic as possible, and with my back turned, I could fully take the expression of pleasant disbelief on Rosa’s face.</p><p>“Everyone helped me out when they heard what I was planning. Which is good, because there was no way I could’ve gotten this all done myself. I mean, I don’t think I even own a vase!” Rosa said nothing, the beautiful woman I loved just staring at me, her mouth slightly agape. I hoped the tears welling up in Rosa’s eyes were tears of joy. “I know you loved this spot, when we were here the other day, and I guess if I couldn’t give you the wildflowers…” I waved my hand towards the bouquets, each a little cluster of the flowers Rosa had admired so strongly. “…This was the next best thing. Do you like it?”</p><p>“Oh, mi amor, I love it!” Rosa said at last, hugging me tight. She wiped away a tear as she pulled away, face beaming, her crimson eyes struggled to take it all in. “It’s so pretty, and so romantic! I’m shocked, but why, An-on?” Rosa’s eyes flickered from the gazebo to my own, still not fully comprehending. “Not that I’m not grateful, but why?” </p><p>“Because, like I said, you deserve to be the happiest woman in the world tonight.” Taking a step back, I pull the final surprise from its hiding spot behind the boombox: A single Middlemist Red Camelia. “And I may not have the money for a proper ring, but…” I slowly knelt on one knee, a sharp gasp escaping Rosa’s mouth before she covered it with her hands. Offering the very flower that had marked out first time meeting each other, I ask Rosa the most important question of my life:</p><p>“Rosa, will you marry me?”</p><p>And you know what? She said yes.</p>
