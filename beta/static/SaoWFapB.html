<h1>Mistakes Were Made</h1><div><p>Title: Mistakes Were Made</p><p>Status: Complete</p><p>Characters: Samantha, Ripley, Naomi</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>​</p><p>        Naomi sat on the couch in the Aaron residence with her hands balled up on her knees. The couch felt so empty without Naser sitting there. Across from her at the other end of the coffee table  sat Samantha and Ripley, both looking worse for wear. They were telling her all sorts of things. Thanking her for how she always took care of their little Naser, helping him through the last few rough years with his sister. Always making sure he ate right, came to school on time. Always coming over to help with the dishes.</p><p>They would have loved to have seen the wedding.</p><p>    </p><p>        Even though things turned out the way they did they certainly considered her part of their family, and would be honored to call her 'daughter' - even if they no longer had a son to marry her into the family properly. Naomi didn't hear that though, in fact she heard nothing. She saw nothing but lips flapping, the sounds never travelling to her. All Naomi could hear was a ringing noise and the thumping of her heart. All she could feel was the building pressure behind her eyes and the burning numbness that had paralyzed her face. All of this was her fault and she knew it. She wanted to spend time with Naser, but he was always so concerned with that trash sister of his. She seemed nice enough when they first crossed paths, but in the last few years Fang had spiraled downwards into a state of constant rebellion and roughness. Always calling Naser names, never appreciating anything anyone did for her. Always acting like some idiot who saw too many documentaries about punk rockers.</p><p>        All Naomi wanted was to help. She figured if Fang had someone to distract her, Naser could focus back on their relationship. If Naser didn't have to worry about that tramp of a sister, he could think more about his future. He could sleep well again. He could be happy again. Naomi found the perfect match in Anon, or at least she had thought. That poor boy didn't know how to handle a woman, let alone himself. Instead of trying to fix that bitch into being a respectable person, all he did was sit by and watch the trash fire turn into an explosion. Maybe if she did something different, maybe if she opened up and tried being more direct. Maybe, maybe, maybe. The word offered little but hollow comfort. It didn't matter now. Naser was gone. Fang was gone.</p><p>        Now the parents of her sweet Naser were complimenting the person who unknowingly orchestrated their child's death. Both of their children's deaths. Her fists clenched tighter, like her chest was doing right about now. Oh Naser. She thought about when they first met, how much of a nerdy boy he was. She knew he was destined for great things, and hung along for the ride. It helped a little that he was a hunk, or at least he was one to her. She felt tears try to break free and blinked them back into submission. She had no right to cry. She played with fire, with other people's lives, and it burned not only herself but everyone around her. Even Anon, socially retarded as he was, was put in the hospital. He didn't deserve this. Everyone was casting blame on him, but Naomi knew she was the one who should be blamed. Cursing Anon was like cursing a dog for not knowing any better than to urinate on the floor, it was just in their natures. She shouldn't have expected him to do something about the Fang situation, the whole this was out of his league.</p><p>Naomi got up, thanked the Aarons, and left in a hurry. Now that she was alone, the tears could start coming down.</p></div>
