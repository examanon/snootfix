She had neatly created a section for each member of the family; one section for Naser, one for Lucy, one for Ripley, and one for herself. She always found it humorous when she arrived to the section belonging to Lucy - or rather, Fang. Black torn jeans, black halter tops, black panties and bras. Several stacks of black forming one large dark blob devoid of color. She finished folding the last of Ripley's boxers, and began to take the piles in her arms. She carried the clothes to the appropriate rooms and stacked them inside closets and dressers with expert precision. Naser wasn't home today, off to a track meet. Ripley was at the station. </p><p>    Fang was in her room, strumming on her guitar as usual. After visiting all the other rooms, last on the list was L-, Fang. As Samantha made her way up the stairs, she couldn't help but remember when her daughter's clothes pile was a tad more vibrant. She chuckled to herself, remembering when she had her own 'punk phase'. She wondered if this is how her own mother felt. Samantha waited outside the door, adjusting the pile of clothes in her arms to allow a free hand to knock when she paused. She didn't hear the sound of music, but she was certain she heard the familiar digital alert of a phone taking pictures. </p><p>**Knock knock**</p><p>Something fell over in there. Samantha frowned. That girl better not be....</p><p>After a few seconds, Fang opened the door a crack. Enough to peek her head out, but not enough to let her mother see anything else.</p><p>"What is it?" She hissed.</p><p>Samantha's response was to bring the pile of clothes up a fraction.</p><p>"I'm busy, Mom. Can't you leave them outside the door?"</p><p>"Busy doing what, dear?"</p><p>Fang paused for a second, trying to come up with a rational explanation. While she was thinking, Samantha wedged her foot in the door and turned, prying it open a tad more. Fang jumped back a bit, but Samantha had already seen the strange choice of attire.</p><p>"A towel? Did you just come out of the shower, dear?"</p><p>Fang's cheeks became dusted with pink.</p><p>"Yes...?"</p><p>      </p><p>    Samantha narrowed her eyes. She couldn't condone this behavior, but she decided not to say anything. It wasn't her business to pry. Judging by the look on her mother's face, Fang could tell she had been found out. She refused to make eye contact and quickly took the clothes behind the door before quickly shutting it.</p><p>    As Samantha walked to her own room to rearrange a few things, she thought back to the incident that had just occurred. Fang really needed to learn how to hide things better. Did she think her dear old mom was born last night? That Samantha had never been a teenager once? It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what had been going on. But with a phone? Was that a new thing the kids were doing? Samantha sat down on her bed, absentmindedly stroking the sheets. How risque. She paused for a moment, hand feeling the bed. Her eyes focused on the phone on the bedside desk. An old isnoot that Ripley had gifted her for their anniversary. Touchscreens were an interesting invention, and sometimes it became irritating trying to figure out what all the new-fangled features on it did or how to call them up. It was certainly more fun to use than the old flip-phones and brick phones that Samantha had grown up with. A devious glint showed itself in the ptero woman's eye as she reached for the phone.</p><p>---</p><p>    Ripley shoved the stack of yellowed papers into the filing cabinet, quite possibly the four-hundredth time he had done so today. Too many reports of vandalism and public indecency this week. It wasn't even Estrus Week yet, and already people were acting like animals in the streets. He scowled at the thought of Fang doing anything *improper* with that human boyfriend of hers. He seemed like a decent enough kid, and of course as a father Ripley had to be hard on him, but he still didn't trust the boy around his precious baby girl. He was a man himself, he knew what it was like. As he finished signing the seven-hundred and twenty-fifth pile of requisition forms and other assorted files, he felt his phone buzz against his thigh. Who could that be? He filed away the papers and reached into his pocket to pull out his phone.</p><p>    [Sammy] Hey.</p><p>Ripley smiled as he read the text. Suddenly, it didn’t feel like he had been pushing papers all day anymore. Any restlessness he had been feeling was immediately swept away.</p><p>    [Rip <3] Hey.</p><p>    [Rip <3] How’s it going, sweet cheeks?</p><p>Ripley put his phone down, face up, and awaited her response while he tapped papers into orderliness against his desk. Soon enough, the buzz of phone against wood let him know it was time to stop.</p><p>    [Sammy] Need your opinion on something.</p><p>    [Rip <3] Shoot.</p><p>After a few minutes, his screen flashed that he had received a text from his lovely wife. As he picked it up, he noticed it indicated he received a picture as well. He opened it up, and…</p><p>    “Holy shit” Ripley breathed.</p><p>The picture was taken inside their bedroom, and the subject was his lovely little Sammy-Cake.</p><p>She had hiked her dress up, exposing more than just her legs. Though the two of them were no spring chickens, she still looked just as beautiful as when he first laid eyes on her.</p><p>    [Sammy] What do you think?</p><p>In all honestly, Ripley had been too busy staring at her thighs to notice the frilly black panties that Samantha had intended to be the focus of the picture. He tore his eyes away to look, and scrutinize carefully. Anything she wore looked good on her, she should know his answer by now.</p><p>    [Rip<3] Looks good babe. <3<3<3</p><p>Not long after Ripley sent that message he was greeted with another image. Now the dress was completely off, and Samantha was wearing a matching bra. Ripley smiled to himself. She was a looker, no doubt about that. How someone like him ended up with such a wonderful woman, he would never know.</p><p>    [Sammy] Matching set.</p><p>    [Rip<3] I can tell. Love it! You’re so beautiful.</p><p>As Ripley typed, he couldn’t resist but to add.</p><p>    [Rip<3] I’m so lucky to have you. <3</p><p>Ripley set the phone face down on the desk, and continued his paperwork duties. One last buzz broke his concentration, and he looked quizzically at the phone. He lifted it, unlocked the phone…</p><p>    </p><p>    [Sammy] ;)</p><p>    Ripley’s face became very, very hot. He brought the phone face down to his chest, and looked around to see if any of the other officers had their heads up. Feeling like a guilty child, he brought the phone back up. Holy. Shit. In the latest picture exchanged between the couple Samantha was wearing a wink on her face, and had her free hand shoved inside of her panties. Ding. Another picture materialized below the last, showing her in the same position sans bra. Her plump breasts were on full display, nipples betraying her arousal.</p><p>    [Rip<3] I’m at work!</p><p>    Ripley’s heart was beating in his throat. The pins-and-needles of embarrassment played across his cheeks, and the pins-and-needles of arousal played across his loins. He couldn’t believe this was happening.</p><p>    </p><p>    [Sammy] I know.</p><p>Ripley sucked in a breath. His pants were becoming familiarly uncomfortable.</p><p>    [Sammy] Do you want me to stop?</p><p>    This was indecent. It was wrong. But he couldn’t bring himself to say no. After a few minutes without a response, Samantha took his silence as a clear ‘No’, and took initiative. Next picture was set low to the ground, featuring only the bottom half of her legs. The black frilly panties were down around her ankles, and it didn’t take much to figure out what that meant. Ripley’s heart was about to leap out of his chest. Another picture. Did he dare look? He opened it, and was greeted to the sight of Samantha laying on their bed. The woman was completely naked, with her legs spread apart just as far as Ripley’s ever seen them. Her glistening womanhood was on full display, and the longer Ripley looked at it the tighter his pants became. The pain was almost unbearable.</p><p>    [Sammy]: Like what you see? ;)</p><p>    Ripley put the phone in his pocket and hurriedly left for the bathrooms. He selected a stall suitably far away from the entrance, and secured the deadbolt. Closing the toilet lid, he sat down and undid his belt and zipper. He felt a burning sense of shame. Was he really about to do this? He was an adult, not some teenager. … Then again, what was wrong with having some fun every now and again?</p><p>    [Rip<3] Oh yeah. I really like it.</p><p>    Samantha’s heart was beating so fast she felt nauseous. Her entire body was alight with the heat of arousal and embarrassment. There was no one around to see, but she felt like she was committing some unspoken crime. She hadn’t felt this alive since high school. She breathed deeply, her breast heaving as she pushed air in and out of her lungs. Her phone buzzed on the desk, and she picked it up. She was surprised to find that she was the one to receive a picture now. She stared at the photo and her breath was taken away. She blinked a few times, mentally adjusting to what it was Ripley had sent her. She bit her lip and felt heat flush in her nethers. She was responsible for that image. Her fingers snaked towards her soaked slit, and she pushed a finger inside. It wasn’t enough. She slowly dragged the finger out, and this time brought two. </p><p>       </p><p>    She gently pushed the digits inside, softly parting her pliable insides. She threw her head back and let out a soft moan. Pulling the fingers out momentarily, Samantha caught her breath. She closed her eyes shut, and pictured the massive thing Ripley had sent a picture of. When she brought her fingers deep within her, in her mind’s eye it wasn’t her slender digits but the mountain of a man she called a husband. Again and again, she brought her fingers out just to slam them back inside. Her feminine arousal was dripping down and staining the sheets. She could barely make out the tickling feeling the trickle of liquid made as it trailed down her inner thighs. She brought her other hand to her chest, and roughly pawed away at her breasts. Oh, Ripley… Oh, Ripley… you know she likes it when you get rough with her. Yeah, just like that. Yeah… Samantha grabbed a handful of bedsheet and yanked it free, pulling the fabric to her face. She bit down, stuffing as much as she could into her mouth. Satisfied, she let out a muffled scream of ecstasy. Her mental pornography switched from fantasizing about fucking her husband, and instead pictured what it was he must be doing right about now. Was he touching himself as well? Her fingers slowly, reluctantly ceased their motions and quickly grabbed the phone. She was too addled to care that she was smearing love juices on the back and across the screen. She took a quick picture, and began to type as fast as one finger would allow.</p><p>    [Sammy]: Look what you did [picture attached]</p><p>    [Sammy]: Don’t waste it yet…. Save it for later.</p><p>    After a few minutes, she received an affirmative from Ripley. He would refrain… for now. Samantha laid there breathing heavily. She picked her hips up a bit, thrusting slightly in the air. She didn’t want to wait. She wanted it now. She closed her eyes again, willing herself to calm down. It would be worth the wait. She smiled. She liked the way this felt. Maybe she should do it again sometime.</p></div>
