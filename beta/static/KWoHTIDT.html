                    <p>Title: Estrus Season Hits Hard</p><p>Status: Incomplete</p><p>Characters: Anon, Stella, Rosa</p><p>Rating: SFW</p><p>Classification: One Shot</p><p>Author: Anonymous</p><p>Summary: Estrus season hits Stella while the semester ends - aka after prom. She then finds out hentai logic doesn't apply to real life.</p><p>â€‹</p><p>Come on Stella, you can do it! You're a big girl now.</p><p>Eighteen, that's practically an adult, right?</p><p>You'll be like the grownups and handle estrus season without any embarrassing incidents this time!</p><p>These are the thoughts I muse myself with as I struggle to keep hold of my pen. My hand is very, very eager to explore a certain aching spot between my legs.</p><p>I take a deep breath to steel myself, fighting the carnal urges.</p><p>The plan is simple. Write a list of everyone I should avoid, and them avoid them. Only for a few weeks.</p><p>Should be easy-peasy, though the burning feeling within my body warns otherwise.</p><p>Oh gosh, this is the absolute worst!</p><p>I want to scream and shout, anything to make the heat go away.</p><p>Ugh, concentrate! Just write the list, baka! Then you can take a nice, long shower. Yeah, just set the head to pulsate and...</p><p>I forcibly set my attention back to the task at hand.</p><p>Hokai. Let's do this!</p><p>Without heeding much notice to the shame of having talked to so few guys that I can probably name them all, I start racking my brain on the matter.</p><p>Okay. Prom. Chadshark.</p><p>He wasn't that bad to hang with, so that's a no-no.</p><p>Who's next?</p><p>Reed.</p><p>Ugh, Reed? Seriously?</p><p>...</p><p>Yeah okay, I can see that happen. He's kinda muscular, plus that tank top is hot.</p><p>Uhhhh...</p><p>Oh right, those two guys from the club!</p><p>Then uhhh...</p><p>I shuffle around in my seat, unable to find a comfortable position.</p><p>Damn, I'm so fucking wet already, this is a nightmare. I know that the first few days are the worst of it, but that doesn't really help my situation any. Damn dino genes.</p><p>Oh, that reminds me! Anon!</p><p>...even though he's a skinnie? Plus he's got Fang.</p><p>I find myself biting my lip. Intersex isn't unheard of. He's cute too, when he's not being an asshole for no reason.</p><p>Mhmm, I'd totally blow him even if he's an asshole.</p><p>Woah, where did that come from? Come on girl, you can't just... Like...</p><p>However much my mind shouts no, I can't stop nibbling on the pen. Fuck, I fucking want Anon to dominate me now!</p><p>Ooooohhhh...!!!</p><p>I can't stop my imagination.</p><p>[Asshole Anon]</p><p>"On your knees bitch. And open wide."</p><p>I obey, of course, awaiting my due punishment.</p><p>He's so strong and manly!</p><p>Come on Anon, give me that big meaty HUMAN COCK!</p><p>"ITADAKIMASU STERRA CHAN"</p><p>"Also, your waifu a shit."</p><p>Chuckling, I get back to the present.</p><p>Where was I?</p><p>Ugh, the list. Great, now it has drool on it.</p><p>Well, five names is plenty. Time for that shower.</p><p>* * *</p><p>One shameful shower and restless night later, it's time for school. I've even put my usual stream watching session aside in an attempt to cool my head. Although looking back now, I probably could have used the distraction.</p><p>Whatevs, I'm just being a silly-cat like always.</p><p>I put on my most plain clothes in hopes of avoiding the guys' attention. Not that I get much anyway.</p><p>A baggy shirt and cargo shorts. Would've preferred something that covers my legs, but all I have are sticky jeans. Defo don't want boys to check out my cute butt!</p><p>After that I make my way to the kitchen, gulping down my bowl of colorful cereal that Daddy has prepared for me. He's probably already off to work, same as Mommy.</p><p>That saddens me a bit, but at least now I have some time to figure out a plan for today. There should be a special estrus education thingy spanning the first few periods. They do one each semester.</p><p>If I don't see Rosa there I'll just find her later. She's super strict about boys, so I know she'll keep me in check too.</p><p>I mean, not like she'll have to. Just uhh, on the off-chance, right?</p><p>Gosh, how does she even do that? Despite my most sincere efforts, I still couldn't push the thought of sucking off Anon out of my head.</p><p>In my desperation, I flick on the TV and search for some morning cartoons. If I'm lucky, I can catch the DBZ rerun.</p><p>Seems I'm not lucky.</p><p>I look around the room, frustrated. There must be something to get my mind off of boys.</p><p>I entertain the idea of a speedy tarot reading, but quickly dismiss it. I know myself too well to know that right now I'm predisposed to looking for arcana related to sex. Even if Gaia herself talked through my hand, I'd fail to give real meaning to even a half-spread.</p><p>Mmmmmaybe another shower? That should help get the edge off.</p><p>I feel a little ashamed, knowing that it isn't the getting clean part that motivates me. Still, what could it hurt?</p><p>I arrive a few minutes before the start, having enjoyed the shower a little too much. </p><p>But! I did come twice, and only thought of Anon a little.</p><p>Okay, a lot. Gosh, I don't even know where these thoughts are coming from! I'm sure that I don't like him that much!</p><p>Ugh...</p><p>Thankfully, Rosa saved a seat for me at the end of the first row.</p><p>[Rosa]</p><p>"Hey, Stella! You're running a bit late. Is everything okay?"</p><p>Looking at Rosa alone, one definitely could not tell that estrus season has begun. She looks like she always does.</p><p>[Stella]</p><p>"Yeah, sorry."</p><p>I take my place next to her and we make some smalltalk.</p><p>She also informs me that there's going to be an impromptu club meeting this afternoon, which is weird cause we rarely have those, and never on a Monday.</p><p>Plus only the two of us can call for a meeting, so Rosa definitely has something planned. Double weird that she's not told me.</p><p>Before I could ask, the head nurse appears at the teacher's desk. She's another stego like me, so I've always found her relatable. I've only met her a couple of times, but she's always been nice to me.</p><p>Today in place of her usual nurse robes she's donned a more professional looking attire, some variation of a business suit. It definitely compliments her curvy body and raven-like facial features.</p><p>I guess she deals with estrus in a different manner than I intend to.</p><p>In examination, I notice that her shirt isn't buttoned up all the way. In fact if I look behind the long tie, I can practically see the top brim of her lacey bra.</p><p>Oh gosh, should I tell her? Um... This is so awkward.</p><p>She plugs her laptop into the projector that's already been set up, and greets us in an overly cheerful manner.</p><p>[Nurse]</p><p>"Hello there, girls! This heat, huh?"</p><p>She does a very animated fanning motion, causing a few girls to giggle.</p><p>I'm lost focusing on her jiggly breasts. Is this what boys do too?</p><p>The slideshow eventually starts, and I can finally distract myself.</p><p>"You probably all know why we're here today. The estrous cycle. Rut. Heat. Breeze. Whatever you wanna call it."</p><p>"We'll cover the topic in a series of small talks. What's happening, WHY is it happening, why you should be careful, and finally how to be careful."</p><p>"Aww shucks, I was a teen once too you know, so I won't be all like, NO BOYS!"</p><p>She gives the audience a wink with a sly grin.</p><p>"But don't you tell Spears about that, okay?"</p><p>She's rewarded with a few laughs and nods. While her smile remains, she continues in a more serious tone.</p><p>"I'm sure that you've all heard most of what I'm about to tell you, but it is still my responsibility to make sure you can make educated choices and don't give in to rumors and misconceptions."</p><p>"Alright, before I bore you all to death, here's the real important part. If you think you're making the right choice and... Love a boy... Be smart about it!"</p><p>She produces a small box from inside her jacket, and hands it to the girl on the opposite end of the first row. Poor girl's face goes up in flames as the box is revealed to be a pack of condoms.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>"Take a look, then pass it forward. It's my favorite brand."</p><p>The nurse continues unabated, that coy smile returning to her lips.</p><p>"But that's a secret too, okay?"</p><p>Again, wow. That's definitely not how I got to know her. She's always used to be so mild mannered! In the past years, she's just skipped through the slideshow, giving us the rest of the day off. What happened?</p><p>I look back at the girl she gave the box to, and note that she's already passed it to the student sitting behind her.</p><p>I can't deny that it's perplexing. I'm actually excited, awaiting the pack to get to me.</p><p>Next to me, Rosa mumbles something under her breath, and I can see her clutching onto her crucifix.</p><p>Right, maybe not everyone is as excited as I am.</p><p>I divert my attention back to the presentation.</p><p>We go through the usual biology textbook snippets detailing estrus, ovulation, gestation, and so on.</p><p>Then we get onto hormones and pheromones, and finally onto prevention and protection.</p><p>Around that time the pack gets to me from the girl behind me. I would have taken a look at it when Rosa got it, be she passed it on without even a glance. Some resolve she has.</p><p>It's an 8-pack of barbed Magnum Dongs. I don't really get what the barbs are for, but the pack claims that it's for "her pleasure". That causes my face to go bright red, and I decide to pass the thing on.</p><p>Except I'm the last in line. I don't want to return it in the middle of the presentation either, so I decide to hold onto it till the end.</p><p>Said end comes not long after. There is one new slide that I don't remember from previous years, a chart of some sort.</p><p>There are a few kinds of dinos at the top, then humans, and then a various list of animals. It has no metric, just a slider going from green to red.</p><p>"Okay, I've given you the important bit at the start so now that we're wrapping it up, have some more wisdom!"</p><p>She chuckles at her own pun.</p><p>"Like I said, I won't tell you not to find a partner. The point of this whole presentation was so you can choose the right one. So, for your consideration!"</p><p>"Male dinos depending on the kind go about it for five to ten minutes. Humans, also depending, can be around the same, but average a good half hour to an hour. Pigs? Several hours. Ducks? Not even if you die."</p><p>With that, she shuts the projector off and thanks us for the attention.</p><p>Several students immediately make a beeline for the exit, the rest get up slowly and stretch. It has been a few hours afterall.</p><p>I've never really considered that different species have sex differently. I mean, for such varying amounts of time.</p><p>And humans...? Huh.</p><p>Immediately my mind wanders to Anon and my fantasies.</p><p>I look down at the pack of condoms in my hand.</p><p>So... If it's not a bad thing to find a mate... If I only need to be smart about it...</p><p>But...</p><p>In any case, I still have to give this stupid thing back to the nurse before she leaves.</p><p>There are a few girls waiting to talk to her, so I get in line, motioning for Rosa that she can leave if she wants.</p><p>She still seems mad about the whole ordeal. Maybe she's not okay with the whole sex-ed in school thing? I've never really noticed it in the past.</p><p>Minutes pass and the line eventually dwindles down to just me.</p><p>"And what can I help you with, little Stella?"</p><p>I blush at the nickname. It's what she usually calls me.</p><p>"Just giving this back."</p><p>I try handing her the box, but in response she just giggles, amused.</p><p>"Oh, you can keep that. I don't think a smart girl like you will do anything stupid, but it's better to have it, right?"</p><p>I don't know what to say to that. My awkward expression probably says it all.</p><p>"Say hi to Rosa for me, okay? Have a nice day!"</p><p>She leaves abruptly, but with a wink. Just before the door closes I catch a glimpse of some human guy in a suit, waiting for the nurse.</p><p>So that's why she was dressed like that. The implications, cause me to blush hard once again.</p><p>As the room quiets down it dawns on me that I'm in the middle of the school, brandishing a pack of condoms in my hand.</p><p>OH GOSH</p><p>I hastily sink the damn thing into one of my pockets, and rush outside.</p><p>I'm barely through the doorframe as I bump into none other than the bane of my existence lately, Anon.</p>
