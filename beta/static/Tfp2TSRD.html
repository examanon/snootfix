Before he hits the road, he gives one last goodbye before leaving his life behind for a long four years.</p><p>​</p><p>Have I ever told you how much these clown vomit colored posse of meteor dodgers meant to me? Good lord... You couldn't imagine.</p><p>This wonderful group of dinosaur retardation has brought me to a new place in the world. No longer am I stuck hiding in the dark corners of my room waiting for the sun to give its epitaph for that day. No longer am I staring at the dirt in seemingly eternal uncertainty. I'm a brand-new man thanks to all of them. It's brought me a feeling that... well...</p><p>I could imagine that what I have felt was a sneak peek of what the afterlife in heaven gives to you. Now, I've never been too sure of the idea of a higher being creating everything that we see before our eyes, but... this experience is making me genuinely think about it. There can't be a feeling like the one I had that wasn't made by someone of unimaginable power.</p><p>But, as we all know, sometimes we can take it for granted. Every now and then, we come to realize this and do our best to live in the moment, and when we do, it's a glorious thing. But, even with this, everyone will have something and won't realize its importance until its...</p><p>Gone.</p><p>Here I am, standing in the hallway right by the main doors inside Volcano High. Everyone that I have met here has come with me for our final moments together. Due to unfortunate political tensions, I've been asked to prematurely join the Navy. With this, that means... I have to leave everyone else behind. My grand adventure comes to an end here and now. This is the apex of it all, the one heart stab that could stay with me for my entire life. I'll no longer be able to enjoy Reed's sophisticated manner, hear Trish's confused-aroused-cute anger, feel Naser's brotherly care, understand Rosa's determination, tolerate Naomi's endless yapping, enjoy Stella's soothing tarots...</p><p>and... I won't be with the love of my life.</p><p>Fang's grasping my jacket as her claws threaten to poke the cloth. She's been sobbing for a while, hopelessly attempting to stay calm for me, but it all just keeps pushing as time goes on. She forces her head down from all of the pressure, unable to look at me in the eye. It's as if I have done something so unforgivable, so devoid of any righteousness that it's classified me as the root of all evil. Hell, everyone's devastated by my premature exit from their world. This isn't what I wanted, but fate's cruel ways of building our character spares no one. Even the most good person in the world could be hit with the worst of outcomes.</p><p>"Fang... look at me." Her bloodshot puffy eyes begin to stare into mine with an endless void. This was the look of someone who experienced true loss, who was nearing the edge. "Well, actually- everyone?" all eyes pierce mine as they await anxiously for me to continue. "This may be a goodbye, but it's not a farewell. Th-" I begin to choke up. Not now, Anon. You can do this. "This isn't the end. You all still have each other. I won't be here for a while, but that doesn't mean I'm leaving forever. It'll just... be a while is all...." It starts again, tears beginning to break through as I futily try to stay calm. "Believe me I-I don't wanna say goodbye either. You guys mean everything to me. I..."</p><p>I give Fang an embrace of my own as I begin to lose control. Holding on to her as tight as I can, I struggle to stand and thus begin pulling her and I down toward the ground. The world melts around the two of us as our vision fades to black, hugging each other harder than we ever have before. This may as well be the final time we feel each other's loving touch for a while... I need to live in it.</p><p>I gravely return to normal, with a wave of clarity ceasing my tears. I let out a shaky sigh as I lean in for the final time. In... out. In... out. In...</p><p>We let go of each other, one more time.</p><p>Out.</p><p>The air slowly brushes by me as I give her what I hoped was a soothing smile. I take one more heavy breath as I begin the hardest part of it all, and that's officially saying goodbye to all of my friends.</p><p>Slowly making my way to everyone else, I shake at the thought of the current situation. This was probably the hardest thing I've ever done, but there was no going back on any of it now. This was probably going to be the very last time I saw everyone together for a while, and I need to live in the moment while I still can. Time will stop for no one as they say... I guess I should go to Naser first as he's the closest to me. Ever so slowly making my way up to him, he flashes me a content smile. This tells me all I needed to know, and it was that I did him damn proud. Not only as a partner for his sister, but as his best friend. He's telling me that I've truly grown, and I wouldn't deny it for even a second. </p><p>"Oh, Naser..."</p><p>"Ah, come on! Like you mean it Anon!"</p><p>He pulls me in with the obligatory hand-hold/hug, shoulder to shoulder. It's the thing that only real bros do for each other. He gives a fist-pat to the back as he continues. "You're a real one, you know that?"</p><p>I give myself a few seconds to process what he just said, not being able to help smiling like a goof. Hearing those words brought some much needed joy to me. When you're called a "real one", you know for a damn fact that whoever says it really cares about you.</p><p>"You too, dude..."</p><p>As we let each other go, we take a good final look into our eyes. What follows is a smile and a nod from the both of us... until I turn away, in which I can feel his depression immediately setting back in. Shit, this is going to be a lot more difficult than I thought. I have to gosling 5 more times before I skedaddle out of here?! Seriously?! God, why must you throw me these curve balls? Is this for some stupid character development?</p><p>I shake my head as I drag my feet to Naomi. Her sadness is actually a little bit of a surprise to me. I honestly thought that she would have been relieved to see me gone, but I guess that even she has started to bond with me a little bit. I know that she wouldn't necessarily like a hug from me, so I keep my personal distance and just stick with holding her hands. With another one of many slow breaths, I give my goodbye to Naomi. "If it wasn't for you, we probably wouldn't be here, you know. So... thank you. From the bottom of my heart."</p><p>I notice her tail wagging a little as she takes pride in my words. At least she's taking what I have to say the right way. However, I give a glare as I continue, to hopefully get my full point across. "But you have to promise me something." Naomi starts to freeze, her breathing becoming somewhat frantic as I continue. "I need you to promise me that you'll take care of Naser while I'm gone, okay?" My glare fades away into one of concern. I didn't distrust Naomi, I just needed to know that she would make the effort to keep him happy. She responds with a firm nod, letting me know that she will do the best she can. I suppose that’ll have to do for now.</p><p>Trish... I have no idea how she feels about this. She's either going to be overjoyed by me taking my leave or incredibly angry and depressed. Guess there's only one way to find out. I start to close the gap as I make my way over, noticing an expression of racing thoughts. She... looks like she's on the verge of breaking down.</p><p>"Tr-"</p><p>-SLAP-</p><p>Ow, what the fuck?! Guess it was the latter!</p><p>Before I can even process the stinging in my cheek Trish is already slamming herself into me with an embrace, unable to control her sobs. She practically impales me with her nails (claws?) as she continuously tries to bring herself closer to me. This hurts like an absolute bitch, but I honestly think I deserved what was coming for a while. I hug back firmly attempting to soothe her, but she's still breaking down in front of me. Before I can begin to say anything to help, Trish beats me to the punch.</p><p>"Why?! Why do you have to go?! Why can't you just stay a little longer, don't leave us behind! Please, you've done so much for us you can't just- just go!"</p><p>"Stupid fuckin' skinnie... I don't want you to leave...."</p><p>Trish begins to finally calm down after spilling out her words. For what felt like an eternity, we just hold each other, enjoying each other's company for the time we had together. This trigga has actually started to really bond with me, even after all of the bullshit she threw at my head. At the end of the day, she's someone I can call a true friend, and a true friend that will be surely missed.</p><p>We let go of each other, feeling our catharsis fading into the limelight. I wipe the remaining tears from Trish's lavender eyes and let her know that everything will be alright.</p><p>"Trish...."</p><p>"You're going to be okay. I promise you."</p><p>"I'm not going forever, just for a little while. I will be okay."</p><p>"While I'm gone, I want you to stay by Fang's side, no matter what. Help her through the pain and keep an eye out for each other."</p><p>Trish forces a sniffle through her melancholy. "...Okay. I will."</p><p>Rosa. Oh, boy. This one's going to be a living hell to get through. Not necessarily for her, but more so for me. For all the times she threatened to bring out the "Holy Chancla", I believe that now is going to be the time where I succumb to Raptor Jesus' wrath. If I must be spanked into the 5th dimension for my crimes, then so be it. I don't care that this wasn't my fault, I deserve it anyway.</p><p>"Oh, oh Dios mío, Anon. I couldn't let you go without saying adiós to my favorite boy." She approaches me and enshrouds me in a... gentle manner? Well, would you look at that! I'm not having my spine split in half, and this was the last person I expected to keep it that way! Welp, not complaining here! "But... if you do not come back to us the second you arrive..." Her fingers clutch through my shirt and into my skin.</p><p>...Shit.</p><p>"I will find out where you are, beat you with my holy Chancla until your Cuerpo patético roto is on the ground screaming for my generous mercy, ignore your hopeless pleas, throw you into my house and impale you with my tail, and then use your dismembered corpse as part of the recipe for mi familia's enchiladas! ¿ENTENDIDO?!"</p><p>"Yep! Yep! Yeah! Absolutely! Got it! No problem! Understood 100%!"</p><p>The furious ankylosaur shoves me back, followed by her pointing at me with the most terrifying "I'm watching you" gesture I have ever witnessed. Everyone gives a genuine hearty laugh, enjoying the absolute fear I'm showing to everyone. at least until Rosa responds. "The same goes for the rest of you tontos!" Immediately, the whole cast stops dead in tracks with their laughter, leaving the atmosphere with nothing but the sound of emitting electrical light. If everyone came back with new pairs of pants, I wouldn't be surprised. In fact, I'll probably have to go to my drawer one last time before I head off myself. Heh.</p><p>Reed. Reed, Reed, Reed. This one was definitely going to hit hard. This AnCap Pink Cubone has gotten me out of some really tough shit, along with that he's been nothing but a bro to me ever since we met. I can't think of one time where we genuinely thought we betrayed each other. Oh, how I'm going to miss your carefree attitude and your hidden knowledge (along with that sweet stuff too). Before I can even move, Reed's already won the race by enfolding me with his head over my shoulder. With a shaky sigh, he wraps his tail around my neck, giving it a soft squeeze.</p><p>Oh, Raptor Jesus, please don't do this to me. Not again. I'm practically living in Blade Runner 2049 now! Stop it!</p><p>"Bro... I already miss you."</p><p>His cracking tone sends me over the edge, leading to more quiet sobs coming from me. Reed joins in with a catharsis of his own, breaking my back for the thousandth time today. We truly understood each other, with both of us being social outcasts due to who we are as people. A former weeb and a stoner may come off as an unlikely relationship, but damn whoever said that ours wasn't possible. No matter what, this crazy velociraptor had my back wherever we went, and I have nothing but praise and positivity for him. Leaving him behind was going to especially difficult. With the pressure in my chest about to burst, I respond. "You too, man. It's going to be real hard without you at my side." </p><p>I have Reed face me as I intertwine my fingers behind his neck, a look of confusion and patience shaping Reed's face.</p><p>"Reed, you... you've done so much for me. Heh, you were always by my side whenever I got myself into some deep trouble, and you stuck by even in the worst of situations. You and Naser are the realest bros a skinnie like me could ask for."</p><p>The pink Cubone stays silent for a moment, beginning to visibly tense up. The veins in his muscles line themselves out, with said muscles beginning to shake, almost as if its host is in an unholy rage.</p><p>Oh, no. Did I fuck up?</p><p>Reed jumps onto me, locking his legs around my waist with his tail now curling around my right leg. His arms go over mine, bringing me closer like there's no tomorrow. Now, call me a homo all you want, but I believe this is the best hug I've ever received. I hug him back as best I can, not bothering with how awkward it may look. This is a true bro moment, and nothing will ruin it.</p><p>"You don't know how much that means to me, compadre. I can't go four years without you, man! I just..." Before he can finish, another melancholic sigh escapes his lungs. He gives up on saying the rest, hoping that I'll understand, and puts himself back on the ground. With a cold wind brushing past us, I run my fingers through his hair and hold his head towards mine.</p><p>"These four years will be over before you know it. Right when I come home, I'm gonna find you guys and go for a smoke with you. Hold me to it?" I hold him by the shoulders again, and he does the same.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"You'd better join me for that smoke, bro. I'll be counting on it."</p><p>We let each other go, giving ourselves one last grin. 6 Replicant K freak outs down, 1 more to go. Now all that's left is... Stella. This little bundle of weeaboo joy has been so nice to me this whole time, and if I'm going to show my appreciation for it, now's the time. "Stella, you've shown me nothing but kindness throughout the entire year. If you hadn't shown up in my life, I probably would've been a dick if I'm completely honest. So... thanks for helping me with all of this. You've taught me how to show the care I have for everyone. Thank you." I bring her in as gentle of an embrace as I can, exhaling slowly as I do. Stella returns the favor, brushing her cheek by mine. Suddenly, a bright light bulb appears over my head as I have my own revelation.</p><p>"Stella, may I have a single reading? For the future?" The kawaii stego immediately fishes into her pocket, bringing out the infamous deck. After shuffling it with incredible speed and skill, she takes a deep breath in...</p><p>and flips over the card.</p><p>Stella's body has turned to stone. Whatever she pulled made it so she was too shocked to move. Her lack of words also has me doing the same. Just what kind of card did she pull?!</p><p>"Your card for the future is..."</p><p>"The World!"</p><p>Rosa rushes over to Stella, completely dazzled by the results. Neither of the two could believe what was shown right before their eyes. All I can think of is the JoJo stand. Damn you, stupid weebiness! Is that all you can think of during your last moments with your friends? Anime?!</p><p>"Anon?" I snap out of my trance. I must've been mumbling again, of course I'd do that. Before Stella can continue, I let my confusion take over.</p><p>"Why are you guys acting like I grew wings? What the heck is The World?"</p><p>Stella immediately jumps back into her excitement, eager to explain the meaning behind this supposedly important card. "Anon, this is incredible! I couldn't have ever imagined pulling this card!" Damnit, just tell me what it means already you glorified Geico lizard! "This means that your future is full of endless opportunity! You will come home reaping the rewards you deserve from the challenges you face! The universe will smile upon you as you conquer your trials and tribulations! Your hard work will lead to a nirvana, and you will swim in an ocean of completion and happiness! There is only light at the end of the tunnel, and you are set for no less than absolute success!"</p><p>...Wow! If I didn't have any motivation before, I sure as hell do now! Apparently, this is one of if not the best card in the deck! I don't care if I wasn't too big on this kind of stuff before, this gives me real hope for what's ahead. Stella thinks so too, as she's the 6th person to obliterate my back. She's practically jumping out of her skin as she enfolds me into her hug. If I didn't know any better, I'd say she was excited about me leaving!</p><p>"Oh oh oh, I can't wait for you to come back Anon! I'll send you OST's for you to listen to, and I'll give you a reading any time you need one! If you ever need to, just give me a nightcall and tell me how you feel, 'kay?"</p><p>Did she seriously just-</p><p>She backs up, giving me the most genuine smile I've seen before I can process her Drive reference. If anybody could find the good in an undesirable situation, it would be Stella. I'll definitely need your enthusiasm while I'm gone.</p><p>A loud horn blares from the outside, signaling that my time has come. It looks like that our times together have come to an end, with us to be split apart for a long four years. Here it is. The Apex. The Climax. The culmination of all of the memories made with these incredible technicolor morons. It's time to play my requiem for our time cut so short. Walking to the doors, I take a long look at everyone before me.</p><p>"Fellas, it's been one hell of a journey. You all have been nothing short of the best, and I would do anything just to spend 5 more minutes with you all. Even though I may be going somewhere else for the time being, this isn't our last time together. You all still have each other to look out for, to enjoy company with. While I'm gone, go on that adventure you've always wanted to. Write down that story you've had in the back of your mind. Compose the song you've sung countless times. No matter what you do, keep moving forward. Our time together may be coming to a halt, but not to an end..."</p><p>"...because true friendships never end."</p><p>I whisper to myself so no one else can hear this last part. "And this goes for you, too."</p><p>The car outside honks again, letting me know that I'm overstaying my welcome. I take a last look at everyone, one by one, and then stop at the beautiful pterosaur in the front.</p><p>"Goodbye, everyone. I'll see you on the flipside."</p><p>I open the doors and the warm air hits my back. I make sure to have everyone's last memory of me be a good one with a smile. With that, I walk down the steps as the next chapter of my life starts with the shut of the school's front doors.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Goodbye, /trash/ sticky. You all have inspired me to do incredible things, and you will always be remembered. Post responsibly!</p><p>-LowkeyLoki</p></div>
