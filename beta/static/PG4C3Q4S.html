The Aron household is quiet; the only noticeable noise was Samantha tittering about, always finding something to clean or straighten or put away wherever she says it belongs. Ripley was elsewhere, either in his office or in the garage working on something, and Naser was going to some fancy school for rocket surgery or brain science or whatever it was. Relaxing as it was, this wasn't exactly how I was expecting to spend today.</p><p>"You know, we could've been eating somewhere nice right about now," I mutter to Fang.</p><p>"And I told you, I'm not in the mood to go anywhere," she replies, pushing a strand of silver hair away from her face.</p><p>"I had reservations."</p><p>"And you canceled them."</p><p>"Only because you told me to!"</p><p>"That I did," she smirks. "Besides, I'm sure everywhere is packed, anyway. You put me in the middle of that many people and someone is going to get hurt."</p><p>"Okay, point, but still, you think this is the best way to spend Valentine's day?"</p><p>"It's not Valentine's day." I groan, throwing my head back as she stifles a chuckle.</p><p>"It's Valentine's day weekend, close enough. Especially seeing as I'm almost certainly going to be busy tomorrow."</p><p>"Yeah, well, you aren't busy now, so quit yammering and do a better job of cuddling your girlfriend," she says, hooking an arm around my neck and yanking me in.</p><p>"Alright, jeez, easy on the neck!" I playfully whine. Girlfriend, though, seems a little… outdated.</p><p>"Aww, need me to kiss it better?" Without waiting for a response, she cranes her head over and flicks her tongue across my neck, eliciting a shiver.</p><p>"Gah! Come on, you know I don't like you doing that with your mom around."</p><p>"I know." She does it again, getting the same reaction. "That's why it's fun."</p><p>"One of these days I'm gonna find something 'fun' for you."</p><p>"And maybe one of these days my dad isn't gonna scare you shitless with a single glare." There's no winning here, is there? “No, there isn’t,” she responds to what was supposed to be an internal thought. “Now hush. I’m trying to enjoy the quiet.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll shut up, no more talking from me.” Fang quizzically glances over with an eyebrow raised and a growing smirk. She knows I can’t possibly be serious.</p><p>“Alright,” she sighs. “Hand it over.”</p><p>“Hand what over?”</p><p>“Nothing, I guess I was mistaken. On an unrelated note, remember that time I decked you into that crazy chick’s flowers?”</p><p>“Uh, the first time or the second time?”</p><p>“That was supposed to be rhetorical, but if you need me to ‘kick’start your memory…”</p><p>“Ooh, feeling particularly violent today, are we?”</p><p>“Now you’re just stalling.” A short staredown commences between us as I slowly reach for the little present I have in my jacket pocket. Sure, she was probably a lot better at these little games than I was, but I’ve got something that’ll tip the scales…</p><p>“Well, I was planning on giving this to you during our romantic, candlelit dinner, complete with all the atmosphere and ambiance one could possibly hope for, but I suppose the couch in your living room will suffice.” Refusing to bounce back another statement and give me a little more time, Fang gives me no choice but to present my gift. Not that I don’t want to, but fuck me it’s taking a lot of willpower to keep myself from shaking to bits.</p><p>After stealing a few more precious seconds, I pull my hand out and open it in front of Fang, the box sitting in my palm, complete with a tiny ribbon and bow. Her expression softens and there’s a hint of mist in her eyes. I’m sure any actual surprise was tossed long ago when I mumbled something revealing without realizing it.</p><p>“Like you are now?” she whispers, not taking her eyes off of the box. Yeah. One of her hands cradles mine from beneath while the other flicks the bow on top. Her smile widens as she tugs and it gives way. And now for the finale…</p><p>Fang visibly twitches, her eyes almost bulging out of her sockets. For a few moments she’s completely still, then her gaze shifts downward.</p><p>“Is… are you alright?” I ask worriedly.</p><p>“Oh… oh fuck…” is her only response.</p><p>“Dear, we need to go!” I hear Samantha shout from elsewhere in the house. Wait, what? What’s-</p><p>“I think my water just broke.”</p></div>
