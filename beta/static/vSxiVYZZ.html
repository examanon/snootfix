They bought you such a cute dress to wear at Christmas, don’t you like it?”</p><p>“But Mommy is…”</p><p>“Amber, honey, don’t worry about what your Mommy is wearing, okay? Can you let Daddy see how good you look when you twirl? There you go!”</p><p>“See, sweeting, you have a fun dress to twirl, when Mommy just has these plain ol’ pants. Isn’t that fun?”</p><p>“Mwaybe…”</p><p>“I’ll say that’s good enough. Ready to go Anon?”</p><p>“Yeah. Is Naser bringing Olivia this year?”</p><p>“Beats me.

I don’t want to see it anymore!”</p><p>“Fang, come on, it’s-“</p><p>“It’s junk, is what it is! I don’t know why we kept it this long, anyways.”</p><p>Observation: Previous owner “Fang” is once again leaking fluid from her visual sensors. It appears her leak has increased in magnitude and frequency in the previous month.</p><p>Further Observation: Previous owner “Anon” has once again restrained “Fang”. “Fang” does not appear to be out of control this time.
