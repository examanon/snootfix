A soft, fragile little ptero woman with a stubbled head and worn skin, leaning against my chest. It had been years since we reunited, but she maintained her almost haggard look from when we first spoke after several years, only now she had put on some healthy pounds, back to a less emaciated form and filling out her clothes better. She smelled like cigarettes and cheap beer, and it was a smell that now brought out feelings of desire within me. She was so beautiful, bags under her eyes and track marks on her arm, proof of the horrid life she took on after our brutal breakup in highschool. I’m not one to judge, my time in the service had me visiting the clinic more than a few times a month for a myriad of issues, most of which involved burning urination and side effects of alcoholism. To this day I find my liver still kicking me every now and then reminding me of when I would pound a case of beer every night when off duty or chugging a bottle of vanilla extract with the boat’s cooks on my worst days.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?” She sheepishly asked.</p><p>“I’m thinking about how glad I am that you saved me” I replied earnestly.</p><p>“Shut up, cheeseball.” She chuckled while blushing. “You’re the one who saved me”</p><p>“I guess we saved each other” I said as I held her tightly with my free arm.</p><p>It didn’t matter what we watched every night, all that mattered was that we were together and holding each other. Any crappy sitcom would do, any pukeworthy romcom, any lame action film. The best part of every night was coming home to our decrepit apartment and meeting each other over a microwave meal, bitching about our shitty day and snuggling together on our second-hand couch. Occasionally I’ll feel the burning stare of my beloved and I’ll look down and ask, “What’re you looking at?” </p><p>“I just love staring at you” she’d say with no pause. “I love watching you eat, I love watching you sleep, I love watching you make stupid faces while you play videogames”.</p><p>I loved hearing her say it. I loved staring at her while she ate too, I loved watching her sleep too, and I loved the beautiful face she made when focusing on her guitar playing.</p><p>The crappy sitcom we were binging came alive in an uncharacteristically uproarious episode, the jokes hitting one after the other. Fang would laugh hard at every other line, and I joined her in mirth. I usually try not to laugh with her, not because I had become a stoic husk, but because I wanted to hear my beautiful girlfriend’s wonderful laugh, see her head pull back and her snoot open up and belt out a fantastic guffaw. Every time she reacted to anything, it was like a gift from Raptor Jesus Himself, and I loved examining it like an art appreciation student.</p><p>“HAHAHAHA” Fang threw her head back and screamed in laughter as the sitcom character pushed out a relatable TV friendly line.</p><p>I smiled and couldn’t help myself, planting a kiss on her cheek immediately after she calmed down from her burst of laughter.</p><p>Fang turned a pinkish hue and brought her gorgeous snoot down, looking up at me like a shy puppy.</p><p>“What was that for?” She cooed in a sweet childish voice.</p><p>“I can’t help myself when I see you laugh” I said. “All I want to do is hug and kiss you and make you blush”</p><p>Fang’s smile became coyer, and she cheekily hummed as she brought her wonderful face to mine.</p><p>“You can’t help yourself, huh?” </p><p>She slowly closed her eyes and brought her snoot up to my lips, and I met her beautiful mouth with my own, feeling like my heart was going to burst from sheer excitement. </p><p>I woke up the next morning to an obnoxious brightness burning my face, groaning softly and attempting to shift myself into a slightly more comfortable position. I look down at my chest, my sweet little woman breathing softly, still deeply in sleep.</p><p>To this day I continue to hate myself for what I did when we were younger, for what I said and for how I acted. I made us both suffer needlessly and wished every day that I could’ve taken it all back. But when I look at Fang, my heart soars and I only think about making it up to her, every day until the day we die. I carefully rummage through my pocket and hold the tiny box, within it one of the most important pieces of rock that I’ve ever held. I think forward to our upcoming date to the pier, how I’ll wait until she least expects it, how I’ll make myself the most vulnerable I’ve ever been in my life.</p><p>“Wake up, stinky” I gently sing as I nudge the love of my life with my shoulder.</p><p>“Mmm” she moans tiredly. “I’m hungry”</p><p>“Get a shower and let’s hit the pier, Tracy’s stand should be open by now” I tell her.</p><p>“Fiiine” she yawns, “I’m gonna take all the hot water though…”</p><p>“I love cold showers” I say as I puff out my chest valiantly.</p><p>Fang chuckles and kisses me on my neck. </p><p>“You’re a tough one ain’t ya?” she mockingly says as she gets up.</p><p>I smile at her, feigning confidence as my stomach churns. I watch her strip and admire her lithe form, trying my best to hold back just this once so I can focus on my possible ascent into an emotional firing squad.</p><p>“What do you wanna do after lunch?” She calls from the bathroom.</p><p>I smile to myself, looking down at the ring and hoping that all the forces of the universe will help carry me on this day. </p><p>“I think a nice walk would do us some good” I call back.</p></div>
