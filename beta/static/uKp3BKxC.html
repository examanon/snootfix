Oh. My. God."</p><p>>the human tries his best to see whatever his ptero gf is referring to with no luck</p><p>>"Holy shit! Look at her!"</p><p>>Fang grabs Anon's head and turns it to face the passing raptor girl</p><p>>apart from her lack of balance, Anon doesn't see anything unusual</p><p>>"I...I don't get it."</p><p>>"What do you mean you don't get it?

Any dino with UV vision can see it."</p><p>>Fang becomes distracted with reading the label on her beer bottle, while Anon's alcohol clouded brain is still busy processing this not really new info</p><p>>but with his memory affected by the half a dozen beers, it sure seems like a new "fun fact" to him</p><p>>the ptero quickly becomes bored with fiddling with the empty bottle and slowly leans against the human, sighing softly in content</p><p>>a few moments pass, and finally, Anon's alcohol-soaked neurons have processed the latest revelation</p><p>>"Fang?"</p><p>>"Hmmm?"</p><p>>"Does your mom see in UV too?"</p><p>>"Ugh, yes, dweeb. God, I thought you were supposed to be the smart one."</p><p>>'Maybe that's why the first thing she got me was soap.'</p><p>>Fang wraps her arms around Anon and giggles</p><p>>"I'm just glad you started using it."</p><p>>"Oh, for the love of..."</p><p>>before Anon can finish cursing his acute mumbling, Reed and Trish appear in front of them</p><p>>"You two ready to head out?"</p><p>>"Sure, sure. Let me just..."</p><p>>the ptero's legs are far more wobbly than she anticipated, causing her to fall back down onto the bench</p><p>>"Don't worry, sis. I gotcha."</p><p>>the raptor offer a helping hand</p><p>>before Fang grabs hold, she pauses and looks Reed dead in the eyes</p><p>>"Uh, have you considered using a different soap?"</p></div>
