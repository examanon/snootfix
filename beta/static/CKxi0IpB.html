She's pretty sure she set her phone on silent</p><p>>It calls out again, the tone finally sparking a memory in the sleepy dinosaur's mind. There's only one person that can always reach her, phone settings or not</p><p>>Trish is their rock, their safe port away from the stormy seas of their life. When all else fails, they can always turn to her</p><p>>But, they know she does shift-work. What could be so import-</p><p>>The sounds don't stop. They rush together, bumping into each-other, like a broken record forever stuck playing a single note</p><p>>The small triceratops springs up, urgently grabbing at the phone at her night stand, blasting her eyes with its piercing white glow</p><p>>By the time Trish's eyes adjust, the text chat in front of them is running millions of miles per minute</p><p>>It's her best friend, Fang</p><p>>The text is nearly impossible to decipher. Typos, incomplete sentences, acronyms she's never seen, all blending together</p><p>>However, there is one pattern that keeps repeating itself. A set of characters: A, O, and N strewn around every other sentence</p><p>>The skinny schizo fucked up again</p><p>>Anger, rage, and utter helplessness flood into Trish's phone, Fang unloading what can only be the results of another fight with Anon</p><p>>With each message read, feelings of helplessness intensify in the petite triceratops</p><p>>Why oh why did she accept a career so far away? She could have waited a little bit longer with the money she had, maybe gotten a job within driving distance</p><p>>Now she's stuck a million miles away from Volcaldera while Fang resorts to renting a shitty apartment with a person they should instead be using for boxing practice</p><p>>Trish's fingers hammer away at her phone, desperately trying to stem the tide of anguish coming from the other end</p><p>>Maybe this time she can convince them to leave that asshole. Skimping out on a few things to get her friend a plane ticket out of there is the least she can do</p><p>>Trish sets her phone back down on the nightstand, its job done</p><p>>For now</p><p>>Despite all her protesting, pleading, and persuading, she couldn't get Fang to commit to anything. All Trish could do was calm them down until they finally went to sleep</p><p>>And now she sits, fully awake. Any thoughts of going back to sleep are completely ruined by that god damned skinny</p><p>>A bubbling fury rises up within the tiny triceratops. Only one thing can settle this: revenge</p><p>>Every now and then, Fang sends her a picture of themself and Anon, showing her quick glimpses into their life</p><p>>It's a small matter to go through them, selecting the most appropriate ones to work with</p><p>>A few tutorials online was all it took before Trish had gained a decent understanding of photo manipulation</p><p>>Finding a place to put the images online wasn't too hard either. Just had to search up for the toilet of the internet to find where Anon and his bigot cohorts would be</p><p>>Some days, all it takes is one picture to receive dozens if not hundreds of replies, as she pretends to be him</p><p>>She knows he's there, unable to do anything but impotently screech at her works. He dares not bring it up anywhere else for fear of being found out</p><p>>So, which anime character is going to enjoy a nice date with Anon today?</p></div>
